## Summary

Join us for a deeply moving episode as we continue Helen's incredible journey in part 2. Helen dives into her career and how she made sure she had a path to do what she was passionate about.  Helen shares the emotional challenges faced upon returning home during her mother's final days. Helen was privileged enough to be up front and center during her mother's illness and even attended a meeting where she recounts how she was able to go back inside. She wasn't allowed through the front door and wasn't allowed to sit with everyone, but she explains her reasoning for sitting through another boring meeting. It was a roller coaster of emotions trying to build a relationship with her family still inside the cult. At times, these interactions were positive, and other times, the interactions were extremely painful.  But Helen persevered and has great advice on how to manage these circumstances we all find ourselves in.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3s)

I imagine if it were me in that situation, I'd be worried all the time about overstepping the boundaries and suddenly having the shutters come down. You obviously didn't, and that's credit to you or your family were receptive, but that would always be the worry, wouldn't it? That you've just gone a little bit too far and they say, 'Right, Helen, I think you need to leave now.' There's always that at the back of your head, isn't there?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3s)

There is. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And you know there were a few sort of moments, you know, um, Dad made me a cup of coffee one day, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=33s) I was drinking it, um, in the bedroom because I used to just lie in the bed or sit next to Mom, um, every day. So usually how I spent time with her. And so he brought, he came up with a cup of coffee for me and Mom was just about to take a tablet and she said, 'Oh, well I can't take this tablet, Helen's going to have a coffee.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=75s)

Hello, everybody. Welcome back to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult conversations. We're here with Helen for part two of her story. I'm Jacky Hart and I'm an ex-member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, who is formerly known as the Exclusive Brethren. And I have my friends with me today.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=93s)

Hi, I'm Ross Turner. I'm a local in Peterborough. Glad to be here.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=93s)

Hi, I'm Gilli. I was formerly in Birmingham, UK.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=105s)

And Helen, when we broke off from part one, you were talking about your grandmother's funeral and what a lovely time you'd had with your family and a nice relationship at that point in time. This is about 2002\.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=105s)

That's right, 2002\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=105s)

You also mentioned at that time that you were at university, you finally got there. So tell us a little bit more about your journey to get into studying as a mature student and how that came about and what you did.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=135s)

Yeah, well in [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=135s) one I talked about how when I was at school I was, I thought that was going to be a pathway. So I was really determined to try and set myself up as best I could in getting qualifications to get myself entry. And I stayed on to do A-levels in preparation. However, a lot was happening at that time and I realised actually what I needed to do was work. And also, I had no idea what I wanted to study and really what I wanted to do long term. So [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=166s) that break and stepping out and doing other jobs, and I got married and I had a child. I had a really good neighbour at the time who, one of the places that we were living, my neighbour was a paediatric nurse, and she loved her job. She would talk about it frequently and I remember thinking that sounds a really good job to do. 

So I looked into becoming a nurse and when I looked into it a bit more I found that there were lots of other opportunities around health, including being [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=196s) midwife. And when I went to have a look at, went on to meet with the university to talk about potentially doing a course, they talked about, well, these are the entry requirements. And I looked through the entry requirements and I found that I had exactly what I needed for university entry. All that work I did previously at school and being and endeavouring to do as well as I could and get as many qualifications as I could, um, had really still put me in good stead to then go into university. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=227s) that's what I did. I actually went and did a three-year midwifery course. 

It took me a while. I think that what I say even to my kids now is don't worry if you don't know what to do straight away. Have a think, do some other work, do some other jobs, look around and talk to other people, find out what careers that interest you because there's so many opportunities and outside there's, you are not limited by your gender, by your age and you can take your time and determine what it is the pathway that you want to go into. [When](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=257s) I took my career or even my university course, I remember thinking this is it, this is exactly where I wanted to be, what I needed to do. And it's been an incredibly fulfilling career and it's really taken me into some really interesting avenues around the career to now working in a very senior level, but it's been incredible. And I think anybody thinking of any insiders there, just try and get all your [qualifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=288s) together now and work as hard as you can. You might be limited as to what you can do in a Brethren school, but any certificates will be really worthwhile. And don't think about making your mind up straight away.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=328s)

Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? Because I did a similar thing and went back to education in my thirties and I worked as a dental nurse and we had an optional, we could qualify for it. But the qualification, I was in the Brethren at the time, meant an evening class on a Monday, which meant missing the prayer meeting. And my first thought was, oh I couldn't possibly do that, I've missed the prayer meeting. And I remember quite clearly [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=328s) mother saying, 'It's for 18 months, you're missing the prayer meeting, you're doing the qualification.' 

Had she not said that, I would not have been able to have had the qualifications, the requirements to apply for my studies in my 30s. But again, like you, took me further. So I think I'd reiterate that, that the education is important and you never know when you might need to call on those qualifications and how they could stand you in good stead in the future. But I'd also say, and I think you'd agree, Helen, that even if you do leave school without many qualifications, there are, particularly in the UK, there's plenty of opportunities to repeat GCSEs, repeat A-levels and to do foundation higher access courses as a mature student. So that, But, you know, going on and doing a career of your choice is an option. But you're right. I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=384s) a lot of people don't know. Certainly, I didn't know at 16, 17\. Nobody knows what you want to do.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=384s)

Yeah. Yeah. So you worked, I guess, in the NHS for a while. Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I had a brilliant career. It was really, really enjoyed it. Um, yeah, and I think, yeah, this is all stuck a passport. Your qualifications, I think, are a passport into, you know, other careers. So they're really, really important, um, to get. But the opportunities as you say, [Jacky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=414s), once you're out, um, are absolutely endless regarding getting qualified, new qualifications if you didn't get into school.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=414s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think gone are the days when you necessarily when you do A-levels and then you do a degree at 21\. If you decide to go back to education later in life, there's, there's so many, I mean, I work in education now as well, in medical education, and there are so many avenues where you can do it as a mature student.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=414s)

Yeah. Yeah. It's never too late, is it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=414s)

No, absolutely not. So how old were you when you graduated?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=455s)

I was, I was, uh, 35? [No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=455s), no, sorry, 33, I think, when I graduated. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=455s)

Yeah, I was 36\. So yeah, never too old. Yeah, no, that's right. Yeah, no, well done you. And then you subsequently moved to Australia and took and worked over there, didn't you?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=486s)

Yeah, absolutely. So in 2012, I was offered a job here in Australia. So my husband was due to leave the Air Force and it seemed like a great idea. And so we packed up and moved out here, started work [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=486s) a hospital in Sydney. And yeah, it's just been incredible, incredible time and we absolutely love it here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I really enjoy it there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=486s)

That's fantastic. Yeah, it's nice. And it's nice that you know, you think back to your childhood, which was a happy one, then the sort of traumas you went through of having to leave on your own, that what you've forged for yourself since then has been so fulfilling. I mean, that, that's really nice, isn't it?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=517s)

It really is. Yes, yeah, it definitely does. I think going into [careers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=517s) and into whether or not you go to university or you go into higher education and but you're working outside, it does give you another level of, I think, confidence as well. Yeah, you're talking and you're communicating, you're learning how to communicate, you're learning how to critically think. In university, for the very first time, I learned how to think critically. Yeah, I was taught to question. I'd never really questioned anything before unless it was in a very argumentative way. And so being able to think rationally and critically and able to support an argument with, you know, but respectfully was something that definitely I had to learn.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=517s)

Yes, that sort of critical thinking is not something that is taught, something that's actively discouraged. Wasn't that the reason why the Brethren discouraged university?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=517s)

Is that it sort of taught you to use your natural mind and your critical thinking, um, whereas actually it's a gift that's great to use, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah. So you also said about you'd had this relationship with your parents at the time your grandmother died and they saw your children. How has your relationship with your family been in latter years since then? So I guess, yeah, I guess they've really tried, I think, and I think we've tried. I don't think my children have really ever had a close relationship with my parents, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=615s) is really unfortunate, something I was really hoping would happen. 

But it's, there's just been too much, I think, distance, um, physical and emotional distance, um, between them. It's not really happened. My parents have been very appreciative and they've enjoyed seeing them, but it's been quite sort of, I would say a polite type of relationship. Um, the, um, yeah, I think it's, it's had its challenges in that respect. But [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=645s) know, they've always sent cards and gifts for their birthdays every year, which has been really lovely. And yeah, yeah, so that's been really nice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=645s)

And after that time you saw your parents with your children, did you, did the children see them much after that or was that, did that end up being that one-off?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=675s)

No, no. So, um, we were, we were seeing each other a fair amount, I would say, in the years 20, 2002, 2003, which is the years, um, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=675s), I would say those sort of years were, but we did see quite a bit of each other. And then it sort of stretched out a little bit longer. But in the years up until we left for Australia, it would have been 10 years from, I think, the review until we left, um, Australia, we saw them frequently.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=675s)

Wow, every year.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=706s)

Yeah, yeah, we were going to visit, you know, go and see them on a weekend and, um, we'd write to phone, um, so there was still and it was still a really lovely, you know, I guess, um, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=706s) a very pleasant, um, lovely relationship. What happened after, after my grandmother died was that then everybody was, a lot of ex-Peebs were getting these apologies. And you remember, I sort of reached out to my dad and I said, um, so I'm not gonna get an apology. And he's, and I can't remember what he said now, but all of a sudden I get a letter from the Peebs. I get an apology letter from the Peebs. It's a really interesting letter and I'll read it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=706s)

Wow.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=706s)

I've still got it here. Yeah, it was, it was sent on June 20, 2003\. 2003\. So the letter, I could maybe even share it if you like, so you can read it as you want to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=706s)

Yeah, read it out. Be interesting to see what it says.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=759s)

Yeah, okay. So it says; 

“Dear Helen, [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=759s) is with humility and chastened spirits that we write you this letter. The Lord Jesus has stirred us up to look into the way you were treated in 1983, 84 and 85 and to reconsider the basis for your withdrawal from fellowship in early 1985\. We have to acknowledge to our God and Saviour, the Lord Jesus, that we failed to reflect his grace as it has been shown to us towards you at that time, in compassion, sympathy and help or an understanding of the struggles of youth during one of the most difficult periods of our lives. 

In brief, we were wrong to withdraw from you. We were also wrong in the way we abandoned and ignored you afterwards, leaving you without hope, quite contrary to the way God would leave us. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=808s) now acknowledge this to you as well as expressing our sorrow for the grief caused at that time. But what a comfort, we may fail but God cannot. In God's providential care and mercy he has given you a husband and family and who knows in his untraceable ways what God will yet do for you and for us all. Yours sincerely and with warm regards,' two signatures from two priests and then 'on behalf of the brethren of Watford.'”

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=839s)

Wow. [Did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=839s) you respond?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=839s)

I was not impressed.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=839s)

Yes. I can imagine.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=839s)

I was not impressed at all. I was straight on to the phone to my dad and said, 'Where is my apology?' Well, firstly, 'Where's my apology from the priest that shut me up?' Yes. And, um, 'Why does it say, why does it not say, but we should, you know, this is what we're going to do or, um, what the next steps were going to be?' What about saying, you know, 'I'm sorry that, you know, we separated you from [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=875s) family and we ripped your family apart.' That's what I really wanted to hear, yeah. 

To say. And then what we're going to do about it now going forward. But there's not, it was just, no, there was nothing. It was just, it was just a nothing letter to me. Yeah. So, um, I, I demanded to to meet with, um, the priest that shut me up. And Dad said that was just not possible. Um, didn't go into any reason, but he said that was just not possible. And I said, 'Well...' but he said, 'You can meet with some other brethren.' And I said, 'No, I don't want to meet with anybody else. It was them or nothing.' [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=905s), he said, 'Well, you can meet with me.' And I said, 'I've got no problem with you, Dad, I'm not, okay, that's not it.' But he said, 'Well, that's your choice, Helen.' 

You know, it's, so there's, so I then decided, I said, 'I've got a lot, I've got some questions and I want them answered.' So, um, in the end, I decided to go and meet with my dad and my mom was there and my, my older sister who still lives at home. I took my list of questions. Like, I, I usually keep everything, but I don't have my list of questions. I would like to have known what I asked because I can't remember. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=937s) my dad gave me a heartfelt apology for what had happened and he was very tearful, so was my mum. My mum also, my dad also said at the time, and they've sort of held this, I mean, this was 2003, they've held this ever all through the years as well. And they said to me that 'we don't expect you to come back, we're not after, we're not, um, going to ask you to come back. You've got [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=967s) life outside, you've got a husband, you've got a family, you've got your life and you've got a good life and we're not here to persuade you to come back.' And they've never done that. And it's, and it's, so that has had a huge impact on our relationship in in the years following as well, because I've never felt any, um, I've got sort of second guessing or thinking there's an ulterior motive in any of our contacts. It's just been what it is. And I've been really grateful for that. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=997s) came away from that meeting with my parents, although I've seen them a few times. 

This was different. This was a sort of a task sort of meeting, really, that we were going to come to some, they were going to answer some questions. But like I said, it was a bit like the letter. I really, I came away thinking, well, I'm not sure I really got much out of that. And I certainly didn't hold any sort of grudge with my dad as we move forward. But yeah, so over the years for between that time and into 2012, there's a lot of contact and it was, yeah, life went on. I think we sort of settled into a bit of a rhythm because up until there it's like, what is this going to, you know, what does this contact mean? How it's going to look in the future? But we sort of settled into a rhythm that has been very comfortable, I think, for both of us. I've been very aware of their comfort level and I've been sort of quite respectful of that and I found as the years has gone on it's actually suited me too so that's worked really, really well. 

Just [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1060s) we left to go to Australia, we went down to see them, told them we were going, because I'd sort of held back telling them and I didn't really think it would, I don't really think it would make too much difference because it's not as if we would go and see them every month. But yeah, they were pretty upset we were going. Mum was worried about whether or not she'd see us again. And she said, 'Can I...' and then she said, 'Can I... we've got some Bibles. Would you mind if we gave your children a Bible?' I didn't really want to have a giant Bible, but I felt like I couldn't say that. So I said, 'Yes, yes.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1060s)

The reaction was actually that of a perfectly normal mother's reaction. Yeah, but actually I'm going to miss you and when will we see you again? It's a normal reaction, isn't it?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1060s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, it was, it was, it was really nice. So we moved out and then the following year we were having some contact still, you know, I didn't have their email address. It was just [phone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1133s) It was letters still. And my dad phoned out of the blue in 2013, sort of late 2013 and said that Mum had been diagnosed with leukemia. He was having some treatment and she was, it looked like they could treat it. But if it came back again, there was really little that they could do. So I was pretty shocked about this. Yeah, in in early 2014, I was due to go to a conference in Prague and I was going to go into the UK as well. And I spoke to my dad and said, 'I'd really like to come and see Mum. I'd like to see if there's something I can do. Can I take her to an appointment? Can I take her shopping? Or can I [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1177s) some cooking? Or can I do something for her, you know, while she's undergoing the treatment?' 

So he wasn't quite sure. Um, it was, 'Well, I don't know what you can do.' So I said, 'Well, just, you know, anything at all.' And then, but in the end, um, they, she did have a chemo appointment at the time I was going to be there. So he said, 'Okay, you can take her.' So I hired a car, went to pick her up, took her to the hospital, stayed with her while she had her infusion, um, and then I dropped [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1207s) off and I said, you know, 'Can I come see you tomorrow?' She said, 'Yeah.' She said, 'I usually have a really good day, um, a day after I've had my treatment.' Um, so she said, 'Actually, it'd be a good day.' I said, 'Okay, I'll come down.' I went to, went back and, uh, yeah, I took her out. We went shopping.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1207s)

Wow. Yeah, it was just a really, it was really normality, I know, which is lovely.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1207s)

Yeah, it's really lovely, really, really lovely. Yeah. Um, and I [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1237s) back and you know, she seemed to be getting better, went into remission. But very soon, um, later on that year, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and very aggressive cancer. She had some surgery, but it was really quite far advanced. So all they were able to do was really give her chemo just to, just to halt the progression of the disease. So she had [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1267s) during and she was deteriorating during 2015\. So then that sort of set off quite a, I don't know, mind-blowing period of time really with them. Towards the end of 2015, she went into hospital and then again at Christmas time to have some life-saving surgery. 

And my dad called me straight away. It was very unusual because when Mum went into hospital, she frequently did go in, he'd leave it a few weeks. I don't know whether he forgot to tell me or what, but he would, um, he, but after Christmas in late 2015, he phoned me straight away and said, you know, this, she was very, very sick and she's had this surgery. And I said, 'Well, maybe, I think I should, um, come and see her. Um, I should come over and see her.' And he said, 'No, no, no, no, absolutely not. You don't need to come.' And Mum came on the phone, she said, 'No, you know, I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, I'm fine. Don't, don't come over.' Um, and then she went back into hospital again in, um, early [January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1339s), and I said, 'Oh, this sounds really bad. I think I should come, I should come over.' And again, they said, 'No, don't.' And I said, 'Well, do you mind if I reach out and speak to your consultant, yeah, what's happening?' And they gave me permission. I was quite surprised, but they did give me, they did give me permission. 

So I was able to contact them and that's when the consultant wrote back and said, 'Look, it's just comfort, you know, there's nothing further we can do for your mum, it is just comfort measures now.' So I saw that, I came home [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1369s) evening, I booked a ticket, I booked an Airbnb just around the corner from my parents, and then I phoned my dad and I said, 'Just to let you know, I'm coming. I've booked, I'm coming.' Well, he was, I'm not saying he wasn't displeased, I don't think he was displeased, but he was a bit, he was very, very surprised. And I said, 'Well, what's your intention?' 'I suppose just to spend as much time as I can, see Mum. I'll do whatever you need. I can cook, I can clean, I can take her to appointments. I can whatever you need, I'm there to help.' [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1400s) he said, 'Well, I don't know what you can do because your brother and your sister, your younger sister, are here and they've been here looking after. And so you'll have to work in with what they're doing and, you know, can you give me a timetable when you're going to be available?'

 I said, 'No, because I'm going to be available for the whole two weeks. So any days, you choose a day.' So, uh, two days before I was due to fly, because it was, I think I booked about five days in, I was going to fly in five days time. Uh, two days beforehand, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1431s) emailed me and said, uh, 'Would you like me to pick you up from the airport?' Um, yes, please. Yeah, I've actually booked a car because I wanted to, you know, be able to travel around. So I booked a car for for the period of time. But the, but he said, 'Okay, well give me a call when you, when you get to your place,' which I did. And he said, 'Yeah.' And as soon as I landed, I had a text from him. He said, or email, he said he tracked my flight, he could see that I'd landed. [As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1461s) soon as I get, please call straight away, which I did. 

And he said, 'You can come over whenever you want this afternoon.' So I, that that was on the Monday, Monday of the first week, went around there and saw Mum, she was incredibly, looked very, very unwell. And I spent, I was there till about eight o'clock at night and my sister, my younger sister had already gone back to Scotland and my brother wasn't there. It was just my older sister who lived at home and my dad and my mum. And so eight o'clock came, oh, they cooked me dinner, um, so I had dinner on my own, obviously, in the dining room with a with a bookcase full of ministry books on one side and then the picture of all the leaders on the wall on the other side. And [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1509s) thinking, 'Okay, yes.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1509s)

I seem to remember messaging you about that time and you just said, 'Just a bit surreal. I'm sitting here.' It was, it was just surreal, wasn't it?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1509s)

Surreal, completely surreal. Yeah. Yeah. I was due to go and so I braced myself and I said, you know, 'When can I come again?' And he said, 'You can come and go whenever you want. You can see, you should feel free to have as much access to Mum as you want while you're there.' And I was just so shocked and he could see the special shock on my face. And he said that, that he discussed me coming with the priests and they were impressed at what, you know, that I decided to come like that [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1555s) that I should be free, be able to see Mum whenever I wanted. And they felt bad and sorry for what had happened to me, that I'd been treated very badly and that they, that whatever they could do to help me at this time, they wanted to do that. So that just set off an incredible two weeks. 

I quickly found that I could be very useful with my medical background with getting Mum access to a GP and calling to the nurse in the community nurse and setting those [sorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1585s) of things up. The second day, so the second day I was usually around there from nine in the morning and then stayed until after Dad and my sister had got back from the meeting because they, that meant while I was there as well, I could look after Mum and they could go to the meetings, which they were really grateful for. The second day, we were waiting for the district nurse and the doorbell goes. I said to my mom, 'It's a district nurse, I'll go and answer the door.' And this opened the door and this woman all in black with a big bow on her hair. And I'm [thinking,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1617s) 'No, that's not the district nurse. Not with a token like that.' She said, 'Oh, hello, Helen. You must be Helen.' I said, 'Yeah.' She sort of looked at me as though I should know who she was. And she said... and I have no idea who she was, never seen her before. And she said, 'I'm Sarah.' And okay, uh, and then the penny dropped and I realized I was standing in front of my sister-in-law who's been married to my brother for 30 years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1617s)

But I think you didn't know that, was it?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1617s)

I didn't know, it didn't, had no idea, no idea who it was. It was just like, who is here? And I knew that my brother had married a Sarah and I thought, must be her, couldn't it? Assumed it was, of course, yes. So she just said, 'Where's mother? Where's mother?' So I said, 'Oh, she's upstairs.' And she just went upstairs and I just left them to it. Um, also, um, then Dad said, 'You know, what are you doing on Thursday?' And I said, 'Well, I might, I think I was going to see a friend of mine in Cambridge in the morning.' So I said, 'But I'd be back at midday, but I could even cancel that.' He said, 'No.' I said, 'I just wonder because there's a Brethren seminar I want to go to with his sister. But we'll be back late. Would you be able to stay and look after mum?'

 I said, 'Yeah, of course, no problem at all.' So Thursday came and I'm getting ready to go. And Dad said, 'You know, we'll be back late, maybe not till one o'clock in the morning.' I said, 'That's fine.' I said, 'You know, all good. I'm here.' He said, 'Go and lie down in the spare room and have some sleep until we get back.' And he said, 'If you're still [asleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1730s) when we get back, I'm just going to leave you there.' So I thought, hmm. Wow. So I got my mum all sorted, the meds, and she was all good, tea, um, and yeah, it was, it was quite strange being in my parents' house with the, there's another bookcase and there's all our childhood books.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1730s)

I say, was it the same house, your childhood home?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

No, it's a different house. So they'd moved house.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

So it wasn't like your childhood bedroom.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

No, no, no, it would have been very strange.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

Yeah, it would have been, yes.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

Yeah, yeah. Uh, but they had a bookcase, all our childhood books. Uh, you know, I remember as a [child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s) picking them out and, and there's one that I'll put my name in and I'll do some guns from colouring and I'm thinking all the, all the time that's gone on between I last, since I last held this book, it was just incredible.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1767s)

Probably hugely emotional in a way.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s)

Yeah, it was, it really was. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s)

The circumstances are such that there's been what, some 30 odd years from when you were in that situation to now. It wasn't like you'd been going back to that home and you'd seen those books regularly. It must have been quite [strangely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s) disturbing, I imagine.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s)

It was, it was, it was, yes, yeah, yeah, it was. Um, they got back, I sort of, so I did go, you know, I went and lied down in the in the spare room and uh, slept a little bit. It was really 3.30, they, 3.30, 3.30, they turned up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s)

It's almost nightclub time.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1799s)

Yeah, yes. So I thought I'll, um, I'll go, I'm awake, I'm just gonna, you know, so I go downstairs, I say, 'Hi, you know, did you, did it all go well? Did you have a good time? I'm fine. She was very comfortable last night. She's asleep. Um, I'm gonna go now.' And my dad said, 'What do you mean you're going?' And I said, 'I'm going. I'm awake. You know, I'm gonna get my car, go, um, I'll leave you to it.' Uh, he said, 'Oh no, you're not. No, back to bed. You're not going, you're not leaving at this time. Back to bed.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1856s)

Always the father.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1856s)

I did want to go, so I said, 'Okay then.' So yeah, I went back into it. I spent the night at my parents' house for the first time since I was 16 years old.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1856s)

Wow.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1856s)

Yeah, I woke up at about 7.30 and I decided I'll just leave and go back and yeah, and just get out because yeah, it was, it was a, it was a surreal experience and I was ready to [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1886s) back.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1886s)

I mean, looking back on that experience, because again, to explain to people how enormous that would have been, obviously once you leave, you're barely allowed inside family's homes, let alone, let alone spend a night there. And what you're describing there is a situation, as I say, that's bordering on normal in that you've got a very ill mother and children rallying around to help her and they allowed you to be part of that. Looking back on that now, you must be very [grateful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1916s) for that.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1916s)

Yeah, oh, incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful for that. It was, um, just something that's really special. It would never happen again. No, but it was really special at the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm very, very grateful.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1916s)

I think what I would want to say to me, it's, it comes out the same thing we always say, that's how it should be. It doesn't matter that you're not part of the Brethren, yeah, and they are. That's fine, we respect that. And I had not the same, but a similar [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1946s) when my brother out of the Brethren was critically ill, um, very critically ill, the relationship I had with my brother in the Brethren at that point in time was as if there were no barriers. And it's something I treasure. Unfortunately, it changed once the crisis had passed. And I wonder if from the Brethren's perspective, you say your father talked to the priest and everything and they all said, 'Yes, it's fine,' or you know, he felt he had their blessing to let Helen into a family fold. I wonder if there's an element of the Brethren that [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1977s) there is a crisis point with extreme illness, the guards are allowed to come down. I don't know.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=1977s)

Don't know. Yeah, I think it's very much an individual thing. I think the reason, the way that I was able to have so much input was probably because of that growing relationship I'd had over the years. And if I hadn't have had that and all of a sudden I said, 'Oh, this is what I want to do,' I don't think it would have happened like it did. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2008s) also think it was really helpful having that medical background, um, so I was able to do so much navigation for them. I was always doing the whole two weeks I was there, I was constantly on the phone trying to, you know, either speak to the doctor or speak to the hospice or speak to the community services. Um, two days later on the Saturday, this was, I was getting ready to come over and my dad called me at 9am and I was literally just about to leave and get in the car to drive over and he said, 'Are you coming over today?' And I said, 'Yeah, [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2038s) course.' And said, 'Can you come around, Mum's really not well, I've just called the emergency GP.' And someone had got there, spoke to the GP, we called an ambulance, Mum was really not good at all, not keeping anything down. The ambulance finally came, I think I called them about two or three times, finally came. Mum got in the ambulance and I followed behind in my car because I wanted to be able to, you know, get away and just if I needed and at the end of the day. 

Um, went straight to emergency department where she was and we were there for a few hours. But even now I was able to switch the dots, make sure she had a medication, her pain relief, um, you know, when she was going to be going up to the ward, asking for a single room, being precious about it. But you know, you want your best for, you know, for your family when they're in hospital and being able to, you know, [navigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2090s) those, you know, all those aspects was, was really good. Um, and I stayed very late and I talked to the nurses on the ward and the onco doctor who came up, um, making sure everything was in place and Mum was comfortable. Dad had come in as well during the day and he, and I sent him a home because he was really tired.

 And Dad said to me, 'When you leave, can you call me, just give me an update, can you call me?' I said, 'Yes, no problem.' So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2120s) left at about nine o'clock, I think, and I got to the car, I phoned my dad, I gave him an update. And then he turned around to me and said, 'Look, I'm going to ask you something and you don't have to, you do really, really don't, you don't have to do this. It's entirely up to you. There is absolutely no pressure.' He said, 'But would you like to come to a meeting tomorrow?' Every bone in my body said no, I do not want to go to a meeting, thank you. But I found myself just holding back and just saying... it was an incredibly long, emotional day and I was tired and I just thought, I just need to... and I said, 'Look, let me think about it. I'll speak to you tomorrow.' Um, you said, 'Yeah, no problem.'

He said, 'Honestly,' he said, 'there's, there's just no pressure and don't feel, you know, that you have to or there's anything underlying around that, that, that request.' So I spoke to my husband, um, that [evening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2178s) and I said, 'You'll never guess what I've been asked.' And he said, 'Well, you know, you've got to go.' He said, 'You have.' And my husband's not, never been in the in the Brethren. He said, 'But,' he said, 'you know, you've got to go. You've got to show them that despite everything they did to you, you've made it and that you, you know, you're happy, you're healthy and you're well put, you know, you put together. Um, and, um, and that you've made a success of life outside.' And said, 'They need to see that, that they didn't break you.' 

And I spoke to another couple of [friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2208s) and they said, 'You know, why on earth would you put yourself through that?' Which is what I was thinking at the time, 'Why do I want to?' So the following morning, I was meeting with my with Pam, who was the best, my best friend from school who I went to live with after I left the Brethren. I was meeting her to walk her brother's dog in in the park. And I talked all about that to her and she said exactly the same as Paul said, that you've got to go, you've got to show them, you've got to, you know, that, um, that you've made it, that you've, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2238s) you've done really well outside and you've succeeded. And, um, and I said, 'Yeah, but they're gonna make me wear a headscarf. I just know it. I just know they're gonna make me wear a headscarf. I just can't do that.' So she said, 'But you think about that.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2238s)

She said that would be my biggest stumbling block, Helen. Yeah, putting a headscarf on again. What's the girl, you wouldn't understand. You'd have to get it straight.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2269s)

Yeah, yeah. So I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2269s), 'Yeah, I'm gonna have to wear a headscarf.' And uh, she said, 'But then, Helen, if you think about it,' she said, 'you go to a mosque, you'd be respectful, you'll wear a head covering. Out of respect, if you went to a temple, um, in Thailand, you cover yourself up.' And she said, 'This is just think of it like that. It's, it's their custom, it's their practice, it's, it's respecting, you know, their church.' And what they, so she sort of convinced me. But, um, that could be. And by the time midday come up, which [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2299s) my deadline to tell my dad, I called him. I said, 'Okay, all right, I'll go.' Um, I had no idea if I was making the right decision. Went to see Mum that afternoon and, um, my dad popped in and said to my mum, um, 'Has Helen told you? Has she told you that she's going to a meeting this afternoon?' And my mum was just like, biggest smile. She said, 'I never thought I'd live to the, I never thought I'd see the day that that would happen.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2299s)

Makes you realize how important it was to them. That's amazing.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2299s)

Incredibly, it was incredibly important. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even though they knew, they knew that there was, I'd never go back. This was not, and it never felt like it was a recruitment process that I was going back. Yes. And I wouldn't have gone to any other meeting, any other, um, locality, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2353s) the fact that this was one that I went to when I was a child, yes, where I grew up in, I'll be seeing people that I remember. So after that, after that stage, we went back to my parents' house and my sister said, 'What color is your dress?' I said, 'Blue.' She said, 'You want a blue headscarf?' I said, 'Do you want any wadding?' No, I definitely don't want any wadding.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2353s)

So explain about wadding to people that have never been in the Brethren. When we were in, Helen, I think they still do, there was a custom to put like, um, sort of wadding in the headscarf to give it height and to make it look bigger and so on. And, um, it almost became a competition, the shape of your wadding, I seem to remember.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2353s)

Yeah, it just was, isn't it? It was absolutely... I don't know if it's the same now or not.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2353s)

Maybe more recently it is, could come, it is the same.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2409s)

Yeah, yeah, it definitely is. Yeah, they were wearing with their wadding when I, um, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2409s) so I put a headscarf on and I went and I said, 'I need to go to the bathroom.' And in the bathroom, I took, I took a selfie because I thought I would not believe it, I'll just think this was a dream. But I'm, and so I took a selfie of me in in the bathroom, yeah, with this headscarf on. Um, my sister told me what was, what was going to be, what would happen. So we'd drive up, we're going to the side entrance, we go and sit in there's one of the back rows. So just be us on the [road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2439s) there'll be, rope will be roped off either side. So there'll be like, she said, 'It'll be roped off either side.' She said, 'We'll have the service.' After that, she said, 'There might be maybe a Peeb or two might want to come and speak to us afterwards, maybe not. 

But we'll then, um, wait for people to leave and then we'll go out the same way we came in, in the car and we'll drive home.' And I was really happy, I was so happy she did that because I could then sort of get my head into, you know, the process of of how it was going to look. And I made the decision not to be an active participant in the meeting. I would not say any [amens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2469s), I would not sing any, same in any hymns, I would not, nothing. Um, I just didn't want that. I was not going to participate. I had my mum's, um, bible and hymn book, which used to be her mother's, so I thought that was a bit of a connection there. Um, and, um, and we ended up getting, um, going. Um, and it was exactly how my sister said. My mum, my sister and my dad on either side of me. And as the Brethren came in, like all looked over at me and [nodded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2500s) and smiled, you know, to to us. And, um, the service was as uninspiring as they always are. What sort of meeting was it? A reading meeting or a preaching? No, a preaching. So there were three preachings.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2500s)

Three preachings as is tradition.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2500s)

Yeah, that's right. And one of the preachings was my nephew who I hadn't yet seen. So that was, wow, that was surprising. Yeah, he's quite young.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2537s)

And sorry to interrupt, do you think, I mean obviously we can't know, but do you think they got your nephew to preach specially just because you were there?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2548s)

No, I did wonder that as well, but no, I don't think so. I don't think I'd had enough notice. And I think, and also he spoke to me afterwards and said, if he'd have known I was coming, he'd have, he's made some comment about, 'Oh, you know, if I'd known you were coming, I'd have, you know, done a special preaching or something.' Okay. So the meeting finished, it was pretty full and I thought, 'Okay, well, we'll be going out in a minute.'

So then what happened is all these Brethren, I think almost, it felt like almost everybody in the meeting room sort of lined up wanting to speak to me. And it was all the same thing, they wanted to know a bit about my life, 'What are you doing? Where you're living? What are you doing now? You've got a family? How many children I have? What they're doing now? What does your husband do?' Um, 'Thank you so much for coming. It's so good. I hear you've been a really great help to your mum.' Um, 'So good to see you.' Um, and it was, it was really like that. And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2609s) I asked about their family, especially the ones I knew, you know, uh, 'Who's married who and what they're doing?' And then I heard, um, 'Helen, Helen,' down the back. And it was, I turned around, it was one of my best friends in the Peebs.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2609s)

Oh, that was so amazing.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2609s)

I just wanted to hug her, but it isn't really appropriate sort of thing you do in a meeting. Um, and I, I love talking to her. She had six kids, I think, and just learning about their lives. And then I heard my dad say, 'Helen, Helen,' and you know, and he wanted, you know, me to talk to more Peebs that were coming up. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2639s) he was like, he was just loving it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2639s)

It's almost like you're a kind of celebrity at that, within that meeting at that point in time, isn't it? I'm trying to sort of get my head around what that would have meant to them. And you know, I, but yeah, it's almost like this is everybody queuing up to talk to you. And, um, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2639s)

Yeah, it was, it was unbelievable, absolutely. It was actually quite, quite nice because these were all people that you know, I'd known and I'd recognized most of them. Yeah, yeah. You know, the children were now adults and the adults that [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2669s) knew were now sort of older, old people. Um, it was, it was really quite interesting. And then finally, it was time for us to go and we've got, and you answer before you and just saying, 'Oh my goodness, you know, um, I was so nervous about all that.' And my dad said, 'Well, you hid that well. You, you, I would never, never have any idea you were nervous.' So, you know, we had a bit of a nervous laugh as we walked out, um, towards the car. We go outside of the meeting, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2700s) again, I hear, 'Helen, Helen,' and I turn around and it's one of the priests who shut me up standing there with his wife. And he said, um, 'Helen, you reached out to me a few years ago, wanted to speak to me and I never got back to you. I never wrote back. I never saw you. I never spoke to you. And I'm so sorry. I'm here to say now, I'm so sorry for what we did to you and, um, for shutting you up.' 

Um, and I said, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2730s) I was just so taken aback. I had my sister there as well, um, and his wife was saying, 'Yeah, we're so sorry.' And I'm thinking, 'What do you feel like saying? What are you sorry about?' Yeah, it's like this, it's like collective responsibility for it. So I just said, um, 'You know, thank you, but you know, I've had a really great life and I've done really, my life outside, I've been really blessed with the life [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2760s) got. And I'm so happy that, you know, I made that decision to come out. I said, but I never wanted to lose my family in the process.' And he said, 'I'm just,' he said, 'I'm just so sorry.' And he kept repeating, 'I'm really sorry, you know, we shouldn't have done that.' The term, 'we shouldn't have shut you up.' 

I mean, at the back of my mind, it was nice to have the apology and an apology in person, which is what I had sought like 10 years previously. Um, but [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2791s) know, I do also think at the end, you know, well, I wanted to leave. It's not as if, you know, yeah, I didn't want to leave. Yeah. Um, so it's a bit of sort of conflict there, I guess, in me that yes, I wanted, you know, I, I never wanted to lose my family, but you always know that that is the, that you know, you grow up knowing it's going to happen. You're not going to be able to have freedom and your family. It's always one or the other.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2823s)

But that's the whole crux of the problem, isn't it? It's, as you said it there, Helen, you can't have freedom and your family. And that's the bit that I would challenge from the, you know, say to the Brethren, 'Why not?' Because yes, freedom, if somebody chooses that the Brethren lifestyle is not for them, that doesn't mean we disrespect it. That doesn't mean that we, you know, think it's awful. It's just not for us. But why do we have to lose our families in the process of doing that? What is it, you know, we're not there. 

As you said, when you were with your family all the time, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2854s) were respectful, you wore the headscarf to the meeting, you ate your meals separately. You didn't try to break those traditions that they've got because we respect that. But all you want is the relationship with our families. And I think that's the whole crux of why we do these podcasts, why we get the stories out there and what we would all want as a result of this.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2884s)

Yeah, yeah, without a doubt. I mean, families are just everything. And yeah, um, yeah. So that, so that was just, um, a [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2884s) of a, it was quite a, quite an event.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2884s)

How did you feel after though? You must have felt drained.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2884s)

Yeah, very much so. Um, yeah, we got in, we got in, finally got in the car to drive home and, um, I said to my dad, I said, 'Was I...' I said, 'Was I right?' Because I don't know, I don't know if I talked too much, if I didn't talk enough. I didn't, you know, I was sort of very hyper aware that I wanted to give a representation of myself and also of my family, you know, um, I wanted my dad to feel [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2914s) to feel embarrassed, you know, about me. Um, and I said, 'You know, was, was I all right? Was that okay, Dad?' And he said, 'I said you're wonderful.' 

And he was just so happy. And even my sister smiled, you know, she didn't smile much, but she did smile as well. Um, and wow. I took my headscarf off in the car because I thought, 'I don't wear this.' So yeah, whereas, you know, Brethren don't take their headscarf off in the car, but I made a point of taking my headscarf off in the car. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2944s), we got out and they asked me if you wanted to come in for some food and I said, 'No, I'm good. I'll, I'm a bit tired. I'll go back.' But I actually went to the pub and I had, um, a couple of glasses of large glasses of wine, yeah, just to try and process what had happened, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2944s)

And also seeing all those people that you hadn't seen for 30 odd years. I mean, I remember at my mother-in-law's funeral, one person came up and said to me, 'Hello Jacky, how are you?' [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2975s) were at the graveside and I hadn't got a clue who they were until they said their name because it's, it's been 30, 40 and anything, you've changed. But yeah, it's sort of processing all that, isn't there?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=2975s)

It really is. Yeah, absolutely. It was some, yeah, there was a lot to process in that. And, you know, I really sort of questioned whether or not I'd done the right thing in going and I was thinking, 'I just hope [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3005s) no fallback. I hope there's no...' and not a sort of recruitment drive to get me back. But there never was and there never has been and it's is never been, never been mentioned. And, um, over those two weeks that I was there, my, I had such an, it was such an intense period that every day spending hours with my mum and my dad, um, and you know, by the end, I remember, um, on the, so that was on Sunday, then by the Tuesday, when I went to see my mum was still [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3035s) hospital that day, I think I went to see a friend of mine on the Monday, then Tuesday I was back and mum had been discharged from the hospital. 

And I went back, so I went to see them, I think about four o'clock I think I turned up on Tuesday and Mum was downstairs and that was really great because that's the first time I'd seen her being able to be downstairs and with my with Dad, they're sitting on the sofa and my sister was there and we just spent the whole afternoon, just a whole afternoon and into the evening just laughing [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3065s) talking, remembering, 'Do you remember when we did this?' or 'Do you remember when this happened?' And it was just a normal family evening. I will never forget that because that was the last time I saw Mum well, well enough to be able to, you know, converse and talk like that. It was a really, really special, special day because then on the Wednesday then she started to deteriorate again and became in a lot of pain. I spent a lot of time talking to my dad in that period as well up until I left. I left, I think, on the Friday on Saturday and nothing was off limits. I was able to talk and ask him about almost anything. And I didn't, got all the photos out. We'll get through all his photo albums and on his computer as well. 

And he gave me, he said, 'Is there any there that you want?' And so I picked out a handful of ones that I really, really loved that he'd gone through and he sent those to [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3127s). And then on the last day, my brother had been bringing around, he's got six kids, he'd been bringing one round almost every day, you know, to meet me. I don't know why he just didn't bring them all down in a job lot, but no, it was every day. And it's one of his daughters who's just had a baby, married and just had a baby, they came around on the last day. And yeah, she came in, she gave me a big hug and she said, 'Yeah, gonna see you now, Auntie Helen.' So I had the, you know, I have the baby and then Dad said, 'Would you like some photos with Mum and with baby and your niece?' And so we had quite a few photos. 

In fact, my dad used my iPhone. He put the, as he was taking a photo, he'd put it on burst. And so we've got like a hundred photos at [once,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3185s) which is lovely. And I've kept every single one of those hundred photos. So that was, that was really nice. But yeah, and then I was getting ready to go and get back to the airport. And I knew it wouldn't be long. You know, Mum didn't have much time at all. And I think in any other, you know, anybody else would probably have thought, 'Well, I'll just delay my flight because I want to be here.' I don't think we could, you know, but I, and I feel bad, but I wanted to go home. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3215s) was, I was, I think I'd reached emotionally, um, the limit. And I think they did, maybe they did as well. It was very intense.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3215s)

Because obviously your mother has sort of reached the stage of palliative care, but I think having the whole Brethren background there puts a different level of intent, must have put different level of intensity on it. Because you must have been, I imagine if it were me in that situation, I'd be worried all the time about overstepping the boundaries and suddenly having the shutters come down. You obviously didn't and that's credit to you or your family were receptive, but that would always be the worry, wouldn't it? That you've just gone a little bit too far and they say, '[Right,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3258s) Helen, I think you need to leave now.' There's always that at the back of your head, isn't there?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3258s)

Um, there is. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And you know, there were a few sort of odd moments, you know. Um, Dad made me a cup of coffee one day and I was drinking it, um, in the bedroom because I used to just lie in the bed or sit next to Mum, um, every day. That's usually how I spent time with her. And so he brought, he came up with a cup of coffee for me and Mom was just about to take a tablet and she said, 'Oh, well I can't take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3288s) tablet with the holiday pen, it's going to have a coffee.' I said, 'Dad, take the coffee. I don't need the coffee. I don't need the coffee.' Yeah, I thought, 'Oh, that's just...' I mean, that's not eating. That really isn't eating.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3288s)

But it shows how ingrained that is in their psyche, doesn't it? The eating, drinking thing, that she didn't feel prepared to swallow a tablet while you were sipping your cup of coffee. And we can respect that. Whatever we need, we can respect that.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3319s)

Exactly, yeah. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3319s) but yeah, the time came for me then, so my niece and the baby went and it was just time with my mum. Um, her mum said some really precious words to me. Um, she said, 'I'd love to stand up and give you a hug and give you the biggest hug.' And I said, 'You don't need to stand up.' I said, 'You can hug me now.' You know, so I just reached her while she was in bed and just, we just hugged and embraced and we were both crying and very tearful. We knew that, you know, we would not be seeing each other [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3349s). And I left and Dad just walked me to the car and just said, 'Thank you so much.' And I gave him a letter, a card with a letter inside that I'd written to Mum so he could give that to Mum after I've left. Um, there's just some thoughts and just some, yeah. 

As I got in the car and I turned and Mum had got herself out of the bed, out of her bed, and she was at the window, um, waving me off. And she was stood at the window for as long as I could see, um, her, as I was, as I drove away. And I thought that must have taken such incredible strength that she wanted to see me, um, before, before she, yeah, yeah. Um, so I got back and, um, Mum passed away two weeks later. It was about two weeks later. And in [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3400s) two weeks, Dad had almost daily contact with me, with either phoning or emailing. Um, he, there were times where I would call and he was next to Mum and I'd say, 'Can you pass this message on to Mum?' And then he'd pass another one back to me on the phone. And when she did pass away, he called me about an hour after she passed away, which I really, really did appreciate. I guess I was, because I've had had all that contact, I guess afterwards I was expecting, maybe not even, not maybe not my dad, but maybe other members of the family or other people to just check in and phone me and say, 'Are you okay? Are you doing all right?' You know, 'I know you're miles apart.' But nobody, nobody did. Nobody reached out. It's interesting. I just thought, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3455s)

It's [interesting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3455s) You'd think maybe one of your siblings might have sent you about to say, 'I mean, you know, are you okay?' It's interesting.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3455s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3455s)

I mean, that's an incredible story, Helen. I mean, I defy anybody not to have a tear in their eyes, you're talking there. But, um, yeah, it's an incredible story in the circumstances of the background where we all come from because it's, it's normality when you've got a parent who is terminally ill, [isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3485s) it? They're coming together with the family, being able to say those precious things. And it's something that's been denied to a lot of people that have left the Brethren. And it's wonderful you've had it. And I think I would say again, that's, that's what we want. We want that normality. We don't, we do, we, we want to be able to express, to be able to say the things, not at the point of a parent being, you know, terminally ill, but that it just through life, um, being [able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3515s) to have that, be able to express how we feel about our family, been able to be part of them with respect for their faith.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3515s)

Yeah, yeah, completely. And it's just really lovely that we can get out there and for insiders listening, that here is a story where somebody outside the Brethren was able to be very much part of that family journey at a very sad time. And you know what, nothing awful's happened because of it. It's okay, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3546s)

[You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3546s) can, you can, exactly.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3546s)

Yeah, it is. And sometimes you have to play the long game. You know, it took me 20, 20 years, um, from time of leaving to having any contact with my family. And then when we started off, it's like, it was overload. It's like I wanted so much more, so did they, but we couldn't have it. So it was almost, you know, being in a sweet shop but actually not being able to, you know, buy anything, you know, have, eat anything in there. Um, but we settled into a bit of a rhythm. And I think it's not going to be completely what you [want.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3576s) It's not going to be completely what they want, but it's, it's enough. And I think that sometimes as, you know, being outside, being ex-Peebs, we have to sometimes settle for, you know, enough, just enough. Yeah, that's just enough. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3576s)

And it's also, I know for myself, when you leave the Brethren, there's a huge fear of rejection from your family because you've had it once. So you feel if you reach out, you're going to have that rejection. And we shield ourselves from that sometimes. And I know I'm guilty of this. You shield yourself from it because you do not want to get hurt again and you do not want the door shut in your face again. But maybe sometimes the onus is on us to try. It's hard, isn't it? It's really hard because, you know, you've had all that hurt. You've been shut out of their lives. You've been told to go. You've had years of not seeing them. But maybe the onus is, and I know many [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3635s) us do, on us to try to keep that relationship going. So we try to show our door's always open. But as you say, it won't be that, it won't always be the relationship we want.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3635s)

But no, yeah. You have to find the sort of comfort factor, I think. Yes, um, somewhere in the middle. And because your lives are sometimes so complete, I mean, my life is so completely different to theirs. Um, there is those sort of disconnect. I remember the first time they came around to our house. It was 2002, I think, the first time. And I was thinking, 'What are we going to do with [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3665s) the TVs we're going to have?' Yes. I felt really embarrassed. I felt embarrassed. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to feel ashamed. And I thought, 'No, this is how we live. And I'm going to put my jeans on and I'm going to put my earrings in. And this is how we are. And they've got to understand.' 

And they were brilliant. They were sat in my living room, this big TV in the corner, and they were great. They were really good. They just, you know, they were just, it pretended it wasn't there. And we didn't talk around, and obviously we didn't have it turned on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3699s)

[No,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3699s) no. But they must feel, you know, if thinking of your parents' perspective, that there must be a curiosity about your life. As in, you know, if you've got somebody outside of anything inside and you have that, there must be an element of curiosity, um, wanting to know because it is, as you say, so very, very different from their life. And it's interesting you say when you went to the meeting that people were saying, 'Well, what are you doing now?' and 'How many children do you have?' So there is that element of curiosity, isn't there?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3729s)

There [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3729s) is. Yeah, yeah, especially things around, um, our children. They're absolutely fascinated with what our kids doing, what they're studying, what they're doing for work. And they're really, really interested in that. They see our children, I think this is probably not just unique to my parents, but they see our children as being very innocent of the whole thing. It's not, it's never been their choice that they are not in the Brethren. So I think they sort of see them as, you know, you know, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3759s) they should have been in the Brethren, but they're not and that's not their fault. Yeah, they're sort of quite blameless in that, in that respect.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3759s)

Yes.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3759s)

But they also really, you know, my parents have also really liked Paul, my husband. Um, they turned around on one visit and they said, turned around to him and they said, 'You, we just want to thank you for looking after Helen, for, um, everything. And thank you so much. You know, you've kept her safe. You've, um, you know, you've been so good and you're such a good husband and a father to the children. Um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3789s) we take a lot of comfort from that.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3789s)

I'm sitting there thinking, 'I don't need to be looked after.'

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3789s)

They obviously felt you did need to be, Helen. So give them that one. I didn't say a word. I didn't say a word. Really? Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, very interesting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3789s)

So what's the relationship? I mean, obviously that was, what, eight, nine years ago your mother passed away?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3789s)

Yeah, that was eight years ago. Yeah, well, when I was over there, I did get a phone call when I was driving off to see a friend of mine from my sister, my younger sister, who was my best friend, the first contact I'd had in since 1984-85. So this, what was that, about 20, 30 years, 30 years. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3838s) I was driving, my parents had obviously given her my phone number. The suburb comes up on the phone and yeah, she wants to talk. I said, 'I can't,' because my head was just not in space to talk, 'so give me an hour and I'll, and call me back.' So on the, out, I remember driving for an hour, I was crying.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3838s)

You were quite close.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3838s)

I was going to say, you were very close, yeah, growing up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3838s)

I remember you were like twins, weren't you?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3868s)

Yeah, that's right. We were, yeah, we did everything [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3868s). She was my very, very best friend and, um, yeah, I missed her terribly. Um, but she had never been able to talk to her or see her or anything. So she, um, so she did, she called me back and we had a 38-minute conversation and we talked about everything. Wasn't really preachy. She said that she thought of me a lot, that she, she'd missed me over the years. We talked about our kids, she had three, I had three. Um, and it was just quite a nice phone call. And then I said, you know, 'Can I [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3898s) your email so maybe I can send you some pictures?' And she said, 'Well, I don't really think I can give you that.'

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3898s)

And I thought, 'Oh, that's such a lovely conversation.' But as you say, it's just that fear of rejection sometimes. You don't want to ask.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3898s)

And I thought and thought about it even in the conversation, 'Shall I ask? Shall I not?' You know, 'I don't want to ask.' And her not, but I felt comfortable. I thought, 'Oh, she'll probably give me her email.' But no, no, no, she didn't. Um, and she did call me again when I was at the airport. Um, but it was just, it also felt like [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3928s) was making excuses to try and call me. Like she said, 'Can you tell me, can you tell me where your son gets his school uniform from?' I'm thinking, 'Oh, that's not just a bit of a disaster.' But about six months after my mum passed away, my dad called me or emailed me rather and to let me know that my sister, my younger sister who's been my best friend, had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And I was just absolutely floored. And so was he, and so was the whole family. 

Um, and over those years, she reached out to me, um, just asking for various parts of advice, um, for some of the treatments that she was having, which I was able to provide to her, get that information and I passed it on. Um, and I think she found that really useful. I did, I've been over to the UK several times since being in Australia and every time I'd reach out and say, 'Can I see you?' And I'd be left with blank, I mean it was yes, it was no, just nothing. So I sometimes go through my dad and [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=3988s) said, 'No, you know, she doesn't want, she doesn't feel that's something she can do.' 

And so I just maintained, you know, email contact with her with occasional phone calls as well. Um, last year she deteriorated, um, and got very sick and the cancer progressed, um, quite considerably. So I reached out to her and I copied in my dad. So, and I said, 'Can I please come over?' Almost like, 'Can I come [over?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4018s) Can I look after you? Can I spend some time with you?' Can I, cause I knew that she wasn't going to recover. I mean, she was terminally, she was, the cancer was terminal. Um, and I desperately, desperately wanted to see her while she wasn't really sick. Maybe, you know, when she was a little bit better, um, that we could spend some time together. 

Even if we were to see for a day, I just, that would have been enough for me. There was a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, but then my dad came back and said, 'She said no.' He said, 'No, Helen.' And then my sister emailed me and she said, 'Thank you, but I've got all the help I need. It's very kind of you to ask, but I don't need you to come all this way and I've got all the help, so it's a no.' And I didn't feel I could do the same, jump on a plane and just, it was, I didn't have that relationship and connection I hadn't had that like I had with my [mum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4072s). And my dad made it quite clear that, you know, it's just not something she wants and not to do it. So I wrote her a letter, an email, and just said, 'Look, I'll leave that offer on the table. It's not a, it's not a once-only offer. If you change your mind, you just need to reach out and I will be there.' 

She started deteriorating in November, I think it was. I sent her, she was very, very sick and gone into hospital, very weak. And I sent her, it was almost like a final email where I really sort of poured my heart out, just reminiscing about the times that we enjoyed as kids and how much I loved her, how much I still thought about her, how I wish things had been different, but I have to [accept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4122s) that our lives are our lives, and to that effect. And it was almost like a bit of a goodbye. And my dad kept in contact with me very, very frequently all through December with updates and let me know how she was. And then when she passed away, he let me know a couple of hours after she passed away on New Year's Eve. And I was absolutely devastated because all of a sudden that opportunity to ever see her was gone forever, gone forever. And I think that's the most devastating, most devastated I think I felt for a long, long time.

I was sad, very sad when my mum passed away, but I had such amazing time with her leading up and not to have that was just absolutely heartbreaking. So I, um, I went back to my photos. I all those photos I took at the age of 10 with my photo albums, there was lots of photos I took with her of us together. Um, yeah, she was, she featured a lot of photos and I was so thankful for that. I scanned every one weekend, a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4192s) of weekends after she passed away. Uh, I scanned every single photo I had of her and I made a digital, um, album of, um, with all her photos in here and hopefully so, yeah, all of these, um, of us growing up. And I sent it to my dad. Um, I emailed the digital copy. He absolutely loved it. And, um, I said, 'I'm happy to get, you know, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4222s) hard copy and maybe her husband would like one, but maybe you cannot reach out.' And he, um, he said, 'Yeah, he'd love one.' Um, they loved it, absolutely loved it. They've shared it with their, they've shown it to all the rest of the family. Um, yeah, that's, it means a lot that I've got that. Um, but it's, I feel really good that you know, they've, they've enjoyed having it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4222s)

And nice for her children to have that as well. You know, if you've lost your mother at a relatively young age, it's nice to have that sort of [memoir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4255s) to look back on.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4255s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4255s)

But a fascinating contrast between the experience you had when your mother was so ill and your sister. And you wonder why, don't you? You wonder, I mean, we could analyse it. We don't know why, there's the overall bottom line, isn't it? But you wonder why your sister was reluctant for whatever reason for you to be with her, whereas your mother is different.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4285s)

Yeah, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4285s) only way that I can put it down to is when I was over visiting my mom and I had that first phone call with my sister in a car park at Tesco car park, yes, um, uh, after, after not, you know, having any contact for 30 years. And she did say to me, I did say, 'Why didn't you stay? Why? I would have so loved to have seen you. Why didn't you stay?' And she said, 'It, it would just be too hard.' She said, 'I just couldn't.' Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4285s)

It was too hard.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4315s)

Yeah. And I think that's why she [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4315s) see me. It would have just been too hard. It would have, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4315s)

And that's something that I think it's worth remembering, this principle of separation, it actually hurts our families inside as well as us. It really does. And I think that's worth remembering. I know you could argue that particularly with the deed of variation that they adopted in their trust, it is the family's choice how much contact they have. But I think because of the separation is so ingrained [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4345s) so many years, our families inside don't really realize or understand that they do have that choice and certainly would be too frightened to exercise that choice. So maybe it was that it would hurt your sister too much to have got close to you in those sort of last, that last while.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4345s)

Maybe, um, I think so. Yeah. And yeah, that's the only thing I can think about, you know, put it down to because there's nothing else that she said. [She](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4376s) didn't give me any other reason, um, as to why she didn't, wasn't able to do it. I do know that she, you know, from all accounts, what I remember of her and also her husband actually wrote to me a really, really lovely letter, um, or email, sorry, um, after she passed away, really, really lovely email, um, about her. And, um, it's, it does appear that she was the bossy one of the relationship. And she, and she was always bossy from when I remember her. So I don't [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4406s) it was because, you know, there was any sort of influence or she was put under pressure not to see me. I think that's absolutely her decision.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4406s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And as you say, probably, possibly because she would have found it too hurtful.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4406s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is, you know, just another reason why you realize so the principle of separation hurts those outside, but it hurts those inside too.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4406s)

Yeah. And yet it's from our viewpoint, it's unnecessary, you know, it's, um, it's, it's not need, it's not needed in the in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4436s) extremes that they practice it.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4436s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in 2018, I was back in the UK. I met up with my dad and we went to, I asked if I could go and see where Mum was buried. And so he took me to, met him, uh, actually we went to, um, the cemetery, um, the Brethren, it's in the Brethren cemetery. It's like attached to a meeting room. I just can't think where it is, I can't remember.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4436s)

Yeah, it's actually a meeting room. There's a sort of, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s) looks like a garden with a fence around.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s)

And then he had to make arrangements to meet the key holder, some brother who had the keys to there. So we had to wait for him to turn up and then he unlocked it. And then we were out inside and he had to stay there until we'd finished. Um, I had my children with me and they just said it was just most strangest, um, surreal place. You know, it's just not something you would expect. I mean, to me, nothing, nothing the Brethren do is odd.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s)

Yes, to all of us, that's true, Helen.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s)

Yeah, yeah. So for them to have a graveyard and then you can see Campus & Co just a few meters away.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s)

Well, it's just keeping separate, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4467s)

Um, but they just found that that their minds were blown that there was this cemetery behind this padlock, um, gate, uh, you know, that nobody else could see. You couldn't, you would know, you would never know it was there. It was just like a fenced off area, um, with a high sort of six-foot fence all around, wooden fence, and you couldn't see through it. You would never have known it was there. And they just found it was just a bit spooky. Um, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4546s) I said, I, I, I just thought it was, well, that's the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4546s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you're quite honored to be allowed to go in them because I've heard of other ex-members who have been said, 'No, no, you can't.' You know. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4562s)

I think that's the Brethren's last act of control, is that they don't even allow you a place where you can go and grieve with your loved ones. Because my dad's buried in a Brethren cemetery.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4562s)

Is he?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4562s)

Yeah, and I haven't been to see him. And I was really close to my mum and she's going to be 90 next year and I know that she'll be obviously buried next to him so there won't be any place I can go and see.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4590s)

Yeah. Oh, wow. Wow, goodness. Yeah, I hadn't thought of it like that, Ross, but it probably is because my husband's parents are buried in a public cemetery. So I mean, we don't often, but we can go and visit their grave. There's a little headstone there. But obviously when they're in a Brethren cemetery, you don't even have that, that comfort that, yeah, yeah, without having to go through the hoops and yeah, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4620s)

Um, there is, there is so many because I had to, you know, tell them a date, at a time, and I could only go there with [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4620s) dad, which was fine. I was very happy to go with my dad. Um, but I couldn't go by myself. I couldn't just wander in, you know. No, no. It was, and it was all strictly controlled. And the other thing that I guess irritated me back in 2018 and that visit was my older brother decided he was going to turn up. But I said, 'Oh, he might turn up.' I said, 'Well, can you tell him to bring his youngest son? Because his same age as our youngest, nearly, [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4650s) will be there. It would be so good. You know, all your children have met me and it would be lovely for them to meet their cousins.' And I thought even as I'm saying, I was thinking there's just no way he's going to do that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

Yeah. Um, and sure enough, he turns up on his own. So I said, 'So where's, um, you know, where's, you know, where's this so-and-so?' And he said, 'Uh, oh yeah, so sorry, um, we couldn't come, you know, it's exam time and he's just got to study for his exams.' And I thought, 'It's not... all the way from Australia.'

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

I know. Yeah, he doesn't want him getting friendly with his cousin.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

He does not. No, he doesn't.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

Absolutely. Just in case. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

I had a similar experience with my brother's daughters, actually, who are similar ages to my daughters. And it was in the sort of period of 2003 and when we were, and I asked, 'Oh, maybe it's a bit late tonight, but anyway,' we are, I asked if they could meet up and there was a definite, 'We're just not sure how far we should go.' And they never did meet. They never did meet. Yeah, yeah. Never mind. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4663s)

But no, I mean, since then, contact's been really great. My dad often sends me photos. He sent me a load of photos recently of me as a kid with my brothers and sisters, which was really nice. He was clearing out some things. He saw all these photos. Sometimes he'll go out for the week, you know, go up, spend time with family and he'll send me pictures that he took over the weekend. You know, just chatting stuff. This is where we went. I know that he loves if we go hiking or walking and I take some pictures of nature. He loves things like that. He loves to know where we've been and, you know, places that we've visited. He loves to travel. So there's things that, yeah, we talk about quite a lot because I know that he gets a lot of joy from that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4776s)

I mean, I find your story quite incredible, Helen, because over the last sort of 15-20 years, it, it's come across that you've had, I'll use the word [normal,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4776s) whatever normal is, but you've had a relationship of some kind with your family, which a lot of us haven't had. And I suppose I would say, what would you say to people looking at it, perhaps from your father and your siblings' perspective? What would you say to people inside that have got relatives outside about the level of relationship that you've enjoyed?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4806s)

I just think it's so, it's just been [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4806s) incredibly important. It's really has brought about some closure to the hurt and anguish that we've, um, being, being through. Um, as also being really mindful about thinking what you, what your comfort, establishing a bit of a comfort level. There are things that I know are a no-no to discuss and I don't talk about them. Um, and my dad doesn't talk about them with me. And sometimes if we start broaching on those, you know, subjects, he'll pull back and he'll say, 'I don't want to start, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4837s) I don't want to get into this.' And he'll be often be the one because, you know, sometimes I can be, you know, provoked, sometimes not intentionally, but I, you know, I do sometimes get on a bit of a, a bit of a bandwagon over something and he'll say, 'Well, let's not go down that, you know, lesson, you know, I, I don't really want to talk about this, you know, this isn't going to go anywhere.' 

And so we both pull back. It's about respectful conversations. And that's what my dad, I think, and my parents have taught me in this preceding [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4867s) is about having respectful conversations about respect and difference. It's about really focusing on the relationship and what you feel comfortable talking about. But ultimately, it's about human connection as well. I was fortunate to have such a lovely, really happy childhood. 

And so my parents were very loving towards me. And since I left and having that relationship since the review, that love that they've shown me is being exactly the same. I've never been made to feel, um, like I'm inferior to my other brothers and sisters. They've treated me equally. And so from the insiders and how you treat your family that are out, it's about making sure that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4912s) don't bring all that baggage of, um, of, uh, you know, of separation around that and blame. And just remember that what they want is what you want as well, which is just to have a conversation and just with love.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4928s)

And that's, that's, it's really is, I think, as simple as that. Um, and you'll work out everything in between. But I think if you can establish some respectful communication, the boundaries will sort of work out by themselves. You don't really need to do a lot there. They'll naturally form and then you'll naturally get that comfort level about conversations, about topics and subjects, about, um, what you can ask for and what you can't. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4958s) you don't have those conflicts. Um, and I would say to outsiders as well, looking to have a relationship with people is that just respect that, you know, the ideology is unlikely to change with grassroots Brethren. It's, it's highly unlikely with a lot of them.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4958s)

Um, I'll be kind of, yeah, yeah, you kind of take what you can get out of it, haven't you?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4958s)

And I think there are some people [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=4988s) you know, family, you obviously came from a family that was close and very loving. Um, some people have left the Brethren for whatever reason, aren't that fortunate. And there may be instances where people are, don't actually want a relationship with their family. And that's okay. But there are many of us that do and particularly parents that have got children in. So I'll totally reiterate that reaching out from both sides.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=5019s)

Um, yeah, yeah, for sure. I think what really helped me is that I pushed really hard and the review [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=5019s) an opportunity and I took it and I grabbed it. And I, and I think my parents and with my brother leaving at the same time, he gave us an avenue for for contact because he was only shut up at that time. So communication between my brother and my parents was frequent and because he was living with us, I joined in. And so I sort of hooked onto that. But I also think you've got to have willingness from both sides. If you don't have willingness from insiders or [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=5049s) don't have willingness from outsiders, it's, you're not gonna, it's hard to make things happen, yes, by force.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=5049s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Well, Helen, thank you so much for telling us an absolutely fascinating story. And I'm genuinely really pleased that you can have that level of relationship with your family. Um, particularly, you know, you say the story of when your mother passed is quite incredible and, um, giving us all food for thought, I think. Helen, thank you so much for sharing that with us. Until next time. [Bye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2mJBqcBtJ4&t=5079s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
