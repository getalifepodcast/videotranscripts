## Summary

Cassieâ€™s story will seem utterly unbelievable to anyone who has never been in the PBCC, but sadly familiar to the rest of us. One of 10 children raised by an authoritarian father and a mother driven to the depths of despair by mistreatment and bullying, Cassie was on the verge of marrying a young brother she barely knew, when she was struck by a conviction that she needed to leave the controlling sect and end the generational curse of spousal coercive control. One of the most riveting podcasts we have experienced, and an incredible story of how a single moment of enlightenment saved a young woman from degradation and made her the thriving success that she is today. Even though this is a 2 hour podcast, it's full of wise, sage advice from a woman who has seen and heard more than her share. Sit back, take it in small chunks and realize why Ben and Cassie are the perfect fit to open their arms to their Australian podcast.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=15s)

Hello everyone, welcome to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we are here with Carman, Richard and Ben and our special guest today is Cassie Davies from Australia. Welcome Cassie. It's so great that you're on here. So Cassie and I have been talking for a bit and you're just such an inspiration, absolutely such an inspiration. I just want to welcome [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=45s) with all the courage and dedication and the thoughtfulness and the compassion that you have had while going through your thought process of how to do this. So I'm going to just hand the mic over to you and you can just let the viewers know when you left and what led up to your leaving and dive into your story.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=70s)

Cool. So firstly, I just wanted to sort of say that, you know, I'm not opposed to the PBCC as a mainstream Christian church. And there are real genuine people in there, and I'm not opposed to them and their doctrines. The reason I'm coming on the podcast today was that Heidi's story, I could really relate to Heidi's story, and listening to her and crying as she was telling her story, I was just compelled to speak up.

Because it's more and more evident that you know her story isn't isolated, it's something that's rife within the members of the PBCC and that kind of just spurred me. I was like, I must speak up and I'm here because I want to see change. I believe that the PBCC system is inadvertently breeding [generations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=123s) of bullies and in turn those bullies are turning into, you know, abusers.

And you know, some this slow erosion of human rights is just a breeding ground for horrific abuse and then the cover-ups after that that are happening are just, you know, inexcusable. I don't care about Bruce Hales and his millions. I mean, he can't take them with him so I don't know what he's going to do with them all. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=154s) I care about the wrong and immoral things that are happening in that system that's created to get those millions. So I'm speaking up because I want to find a solution. And I don't want to find myself in 10 or 15 years' time or 20 years' time even with nephews and nieces or hearing about nephews and nieces going through that same systematic abuse.

So I think that's why we're all here, right?

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

It is. Yeah.

### **Cassie Davies**

Yeah. So for me, I was born in Perth, Western Australia. I was the second eldest of 10 children, so it was a very big family. I left firstly in mid-2005 and then, no sorry, it might have been 2004, mid-2004, and then Christmas 2005 I left again and left for good. So [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=215s) been out properly for about 18 years now.

My family were a very big family and being the second eldest it was, you know, very busy. My mum was one of 13 and my dad was one of seven, so there was always company, always people around, and you know, cousins and all sorts of company. I don't know exactly how we came to be, how my [grandparents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=246s) came to be in the PBCC. I don't know that story, obviously we don't talk about history a lot in there as you would know.

I'm second generation as far as our third generation. And for my parents and certainly myself, that's all we knew. We were born into it and then we grew up in it and that's all we knew. I went to a public primary school, but then obviously there were restrictions there, like we weren't allowed to use computers, we weren't out to watch TV, we weren't allowed to, you know, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=284s) sex education or religious studies or anything like that. We were pulled out of those classes.

And then we did homeschooling for high school. As students that came to high school, there wasn't a Brethren school at that stage for us because we were in the country and they didn't have the Brethren school. So we had to do it through distance education. And I thrived in that environment because I love to learn and I'm a bit of a, you know, [bookworm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=314s) anyway, so I really loved that. And I could be home more helping mum with the younger ones.

I remember I used to sit up at night doing my work because it was a bit chaotic during the day with all the kids coming and going and fighting and screaming and yelling. So I would sleep during the day and then stay up at night and do my studies. And I would have the baby at my [feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=344s) and I'd be rocking the baby and do my studies and that's how I got through high school.

Something that really irked me was when it came to year 11, I was quite competitive. And when it came to year 11, it came time to pick what they called tertiary, what do they call, do you know what they call Ben, TEE subject?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=368s)

Studies, is it tertiary extra, tertiary studies or?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=373s)

Yeah, tertiary, I can't remember, TEE subjects anyway. So basically what you have to do, four TEE subjects to be able to go on to college. You have to pass four TEE exams to be able to go on to college and I wanted to pick four. And I was restricted and told that no, I could only do three. So I fought that really hard because I was really peeved. I wanted to measure myself against [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=403s) other girls that I knew would, you know, like the girls from my primary school years.

Yeah, that I knew had talked about college and were going on to college. And I didn't necessarily want to go on to college, I just wanted to measure myself against them because I was that little bit of, you know, sort of a competitive spirit. So I wanted to just at least have that in my, you know, resume that I'd passed the exams, that I could have gone on to college. But yeah, the [powers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=433s) that be said no, you can't do four, you've got, you know, the max you can do is three. So yeah, that was it. I had to drop one.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=443s)

That's purely, that's purely to control so you don't ever think about because you don't have it there, right? You didn't do it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=450s)

It closes the door. It closes the door to college.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=453s)

Yeah. Just explaining that for outsiders that don't know the system that well.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=460s)

Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's purely, purely a systematic thing to close the door and not give you the option. If the temptation's not there, you can't take it, right? You know, if it's been closed off to you, there's no way, you know. So yeah, that was really brutal. I was really peeved about that.

But as I got older, so from quite a young age, I remember we had a great family life, you know, we had so many people around us and cousins and we [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=490s) go to granny's house and, you know, had grannies on both sides and then cousins on both sides and we were farmers so we had, you know, this farm to roam around and it was a very happy life growing up. But as I got older, I became more aware of just what I perceived to be quite a toxic relationship between my parents.

When I look back, I can remember just, you know, a lot of arguing, a lot of sarcasm thrown at each other, you know, a lot of [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=520s) general contempt in the house. And I think it was, I don't think it was always that way. I think from when we were quite young, it was probably not so bad. And I think they were actually probably one of the couples that got to choose each other because they were local to each other. So my mum was from Dalwallinu, my dad was from Kalannie, and you know, they used to interchange a lot.

I know outside listeners probably won't understand what interchange means, but that's where, you know, the church sort of goes to [each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=550s) each place on a Sunday or weekend or whatever. So I believe they got to choose each other. I do know that, you know, my mum's brother had some reservations about them getting married and voiced those to mum, and I know that because she told me that herself. But ultimately they got married and that was it. 10 kids later.

So I'm [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=580s) going to go into any details of what I witnessed of their relationship because I want to show some compassion and I realize, you know, that they were just a product of their environment and their upbringing. So, you know, I'm not excusing it, but I'm just not ready to share, you know, some of that stuff that I witnessed.

I can only say that, you know, listening to Anne Hamilton's story on here, I was just literally sobbing the whole way through, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=611s) know, I felt I could really relate to it. And then Heidi McCamley's story was just the catalyst for me, you know, to speak up because it just breaks my heart how widespread and systematic the abuse is. And it has to change, like something has to change. And that's not even getting started on the denial and the victim shaming and, you know, the follow-on of the abuse.

So yeah, anyways, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=642s) digress. Anyways, I started to notice a bit of a pattern with mum being unwell. So what I do remember is we were always, we were quite often shipped out to family members for quite long periods of time and we were told that mum was unwell and unwell mentally. And I started to notice a bit of a pattern and it kind of came after every child. So, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=672s) know, if I look back a bit, you know, it was after every baby there'd be a period of bliss when the baby came home and then gradually it would deteriorate and then, you know, she would be unwell and sent for help and we'd all be shipped out to various family members until she was back on the straight and narrow.

I felt really frustrated that she was always labeled the problem. From where I was sitting, she was always labeled unsubmissive and just too outspoken, I suppose. And from where I was sitting, I couldn't understand why it was always her that was the problem. And yeah, I felt she was just pushed to the edge at times. It was actually more like she was [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=725s) pushed to the edge of her sanity and then she was labeled the basket case.

So, you know, it was always, you know, when she finally gave in, she was actually labeled bipolar. I mean, that was thrown around a lot, that she was bipolar, although I never ever saw an actual official diagnosis of that. And then, you know, things I started to notice as I was growing up, you know, she would be [attacked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=755s) at every opportunity for the most smallest things. I mean, my sister one time had a little girl over for a play date after school, another Brethren girl came over for a play date and the mum came to pick the child up and they'd had a little argument, you know, as kids do.

And she, you know, mum sort of said to her, oh, she came out and she was having a big say-so about my sister and mum kind of said, oh, come on, you know, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=785s) a bit unfair. You know, I kind of find that sometimes you're better off just to let kids sort it out themselves. And this mother turned around and said to my mum, "Oh, you're just mental, go and take your tablets." You know, like that was just a standard, that was just a standard sort of rhetoric that she got every time she spoke up or disagreed with anybody or, you know, like it was just, we knew it. In fact, you know, we used to get it in the playground, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=815s), or at church, you know, if we ever had a disagreement with anyone in the community or any of the kids, it was always, "Oh, you're just mental, you're just like your mum." You know, "Oh, you're mental, you're mental, you're just like your mom." You know, that's kind of bullying that happened just all the time.

So that was from such a young age, we just believed that she was mental, you know. But as we got older, we kind of were going, hang on, you know, what we're seeing happening here is [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=845s) quite that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=848s)

Yeah, the sad thing with that, Cassie, is that like, in a similar circumstance I witnessed and have heard other people say, kids don't have that opinion, aren't aware of that. That's learned behavior. So the sad thing is here, they've heard their parents talk about it.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=864s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=865s)

Exactly.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=866s)

Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, that's a prime example of the mother that's saying, like after a kid's argument is just going to turn around and attack her, you know, like, "Oh, you're just mental, you're just like your mom." I mean, "No, you're just mental, go and take your tablets." You know. So after that, you know, you started to sort of wake up and go, hang on, you know, she didn't say anything wrong, she wasn't doing anything wrong, she was actually trying to de-escalate the situation and she's [mental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=896s)?

Yeah, and so I sort of became quite protective over that, you know, after that and started to sort of really waken up to what was going on really. And then, yeah, she was just rebuked mental for everything, everything that didn't agree with whoever. And it felt like that it was anticipated that she was mentally unstable because of her family history. It was a very much a family history sort of [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=927s) line of thinking as well.

I won't go into too much of that, but essentially her father took his own life when she was only seven and it's rumored that he was horrifically bullied by another member of the PBCC. So yeah, that's a whole other story. And I believe she got help from Dr. Kirkpatrick even at some point. I remember his name being thrown around a lot [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=957s) her mental health.

And you know, she was given medication and she used to fight against the medication and you know, that was just, you know, her being rebellious and all of the rest of it. And what I do know is I witnessed her become increasingly paranoid about being taken to see doctors. And any treatment that they were giving her, she was just so paranoid about it and used to fight against it with all her might. And you know, we couldn't [understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=987s) if this medicine is helping her, then why is she so against it? You know, why is she fighting with everything she's got against the medication?

She'd go on it and she, you know, be subdued and she'd be, you know, sort of sedated essentially. And then, you know, she'd be barely able to cope in the house and, you know, I now understand more around what that was. But [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1017s) also had a real paranoia about male practitioners. Like she refused, you know, like she just couldn't trust and even today she can't trust male practitioners even in the general out there. She doesn't believe that they've got her best interests at heart.

So that's really hard. And she was never allowed to go and see these people on her own. She always had to be supervised, like she always had to have someone with her when she was going to see these people. And you know, I was like, how is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1047s), how is it that the doctors didn't, you know, pick up on something? 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1056s)

But I mean, now they probably did.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1057s)

Well, now we understand they probably were carefully selected, right? So yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1063s)

And they, and outside doctors do pick up on it because I've had a conversation with one now as I go, you know, that I used to see with a priest or, and they're like, what can we do? You know, we understand that the narrative is trying to, someone's trying to control the narrative, but we're not going to help the situation if we go, can you go out? You know, so yeah, it's so hard.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1084s)

So much there. And she was even put in Graylands at one point. And Graylands is like horrific. It's essentially a prison for the worst mental cases in the state and it's a horrific place. In fact, I believe it's actually been closed down now. Well, it's not closed yet, but they're in the process of closing it down because they're going towards a more community-based treatment.

But it's the, what I wrote down what it is actually, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1115s) Graylands is Western Australia's largest mental health inpatient facility and the only public standalone psychiatric teaching hospital. And I mean, she was locked behind bars. She was, I believe at one time she was put in the wrong section and she was locked up with prisoners that were mentally unstable. My brother told me that he went to visit her there. I don't remember a lot of visiting her [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1145s) because I think I've just blocked it out, to be honest.

But my brother told me he remembered visiting her there. And in the corridor, he witnessed another guy stabbing himself. And, I mean, we were kids. So I don't know what the hell we were even doing there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1163s)

When they classify it like a psychiatric hospital slash in-house, it's literally just a prettier name for what were mental asylums. Prison health doctors, psychiatric counselors, or create a proper plan or an environment for somebody to live or grow safely with that.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1182s)

Yeah, I mean, and we question now, was she even mentally ill or was she driven there? But anyway, she was so terrified. Like she had some of the experiences she had in there, she's never spoken about it because she just doesn't talk about it. But I know for a fact she was so terrified of that place. At one time we happened to be driving past it. I think she had been down to Perth and she'd been unwell and we picked her up and she's still clearly [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1212s) distressed.

And we're, the whole family in the van and we were driving and we happened to be driving past this hospital and dad had taken a wrong turn and realized, oh shivers, you know, he's taken the wrong turn, he needs to go back. And he went to do, he did a U-turn and she was so terrified. She thought he was, I think they might have had an argument or something, and she was so terrified she thought that he was going to take her back there that she tried to leap out of the vehicle. She tried to leap out of the vehicle [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1242s) I remember her unbuckling herself and literally opening the door and lunging for the door in front of all us kids and dad had to hold her in the vehicle. That's how scared she was of going back there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1255s)

Yeah, well, the trauma there must have been like, would never probably leave her. But do you see like now outside, like looking back in at things like that, like the distrust that is created between family members? Like in that scenario, for example, because the system is church, religion first, and then family. You know how like brothers and sisters dob on each other, rat each other out, cousins, family. So she probably [suffers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1285s) so much trauma from that place and distrust from men because or family, that she probably could have even thought that it was just like a trap, you know, like to get her back in there.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1298s)

Oh yeah, that was constant. Yeah, like there's other times that me and my brother have had to wrestle a knife out of her hands and put our bodies in the doorway of the laundry so that she didn't harm herself. And you know, another time she was so distressed, she just needed out and we offered to take her for a drive and we were driving and we're doing 100 kilometers an hour in the car just to get her away, just to get her some air. And she again tried to leap from the car because she was just, [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1328s) just needed to get away. So yeah, I'm just trying to illustrate for the listeners the kind of distress that we were dealing with as children and there was no help for that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1341s)

And was it a specific set of priests that were handling this situation? Like, does Perth, I'm just going to relate it to Maple Creek, like does Perth have that systematic abuse and bullying from a specific set of families in Perth? Or is it like, did those positions of bullies that would come in and out, did it change with people or was it a specific set of people that were always in there [stirring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1371s) this up?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1372s)

I think like, initially, like I think it was just the toxicity of the relationship and the inability to speak up about that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1384s)

Because of the circumstances, you mean, inability being the environment you're in.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1390s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to think of where the help should have been, right? Because we all, I mean, we all speak up because we want to make changes, right? And so I think I'm just trying to expand it out.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1404s)

She wasn't submissive in the relationship, so, and that's about as much as I can kind of say.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1411s)

And bottom line, like with any relationship, if the woman, because men are above women, women are second to men, if the woman isn't submissive, that's the issue. That's the problem. Like in a similar situation, my grandma was very outspoken, similar issue. "Well, you had the car accident because you're not submissive." You know, "You had this happen to you because you're not submissive." Not just, no, incidents.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1437s)

Yeah, but just an insight, like just a little insight into how terrible mental health, how highly it featured in the members of the PBCC. I mean, I was from a tiny little town of Kalannie and then there was Dalwallinu, it was a bit bigger. And both towns were probably, you know, Kalannie was at least 50-50 Brethren, and then Dalwallinu was probably at least, you know, 40% Brethren.

And I know a local doctor was posted there and they stated that when they arrived there, they were looking for a church to join. And so they sort of were scouting out churches around Dalwallinu to find out which one they would join. And it became, she said, I'm just being, trying to be very careful here, because [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1494s) were quoted as having said that after a very short period of time, it was very clear to them that the PBCC was not the church to join and it was not the best church to join because of the incredibly high percentage of the members that she was treating with strong antidepressants.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1517s)

And so that's known like everywhere. My doctor locally said to me, he said since I've left, like and I still see the same GP, he said, "Like the transition with mental health and health," he said, "tell me honestly, like why do you think there is such a high percentage of people that I treat here locally with alcohol issues, mental health issues, antidepressants?" And it is a known thing.

Like they've said, like I've had [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1547s) Hales family member say to me, an older guy, like Hales guy say to me, "If you knew how many people on the front row were on antidepressants." Because Dr. Roger gave me Prozac at one point to help with depression and he was like, "If you only knew how many people on the front row were on the same tablets, on antidepressants." And I knew also that the quantity of people on the front row that also drank, which you couldn't drink alcohol with these tablets. So I'm like...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1574s)

I know. Mum was a heavy drinker as well and still is and you know, I just, it blows my mind how the two can go together. It doesn't make any sense to me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1585s)

They don't. And I really feel for all of them because it is a crutch. Like we all need crutches or vices in our life to help us cope with situations. Out here we have people we can speak to. In there, there's nothing. It's just such a toxic environment, you rely heavily then on substance.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1601s)

Yeah. And as far as my dad's, my relationship with my dad, there wasn't a relationship. Like he was just there. He was the authoritarian. He was just there in the house. He was just there to come down on us when we weren't listening to mum and, you know, if she got desperate, you know, she'd say, "Well, I'll have to get dad involved." And yeah, there was no real connection with dad. So I didn't really know who he was. He was just, he was [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1631s) there and he was just the authoritarian.

So growing up, I was the golden-haired child. Like I was the one that was, you know, totally buying everything. Like I was growing my hair, was the only one that was growing her hair, was not cut. It was down to my fingertips and I used to get teased badly for it, but you know, here I was believing that that was the right thing to do. You know, I was mum's little golden-haired girl doing all the right things. And it got to a point where I couldn't work out why actually I was being [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1662s) out of everything. All the teenagers were doing all this stuff and I was being left out.

And I couldn't work out, you know, I was a pretty ordinary kid, but I didn't understand and I thought I was well-liked, but I was actually being left out of all stuff. And it wasn't until I was actually introduced to the underworld that was going on that my whole perception of the Brethren changed. Because it was like the teenagers were doing stuff under, you know, in this underworld that was just mind-blowing. Like to [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1692s), here I'd been doing all the right things for years and years and years.

And then it got to, it actually, it came to a funny story, it came to a crunch because we were farmers. So dad was always looking for, you know, help on the farm and, you know, when it came to harvest time and seeding time, you had to go all night. So there was, you know, round-the-clock shifts that needed to happen. And there was schooling also that needed to happen and so, you know, the boys would be driving tractors all night and trying to do [schoolwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1722s) during the day and whatever.

And I used to beg dad, you know, "Why can't I go out and drive the tractor? I can drive the tractor as good as the boys, you know, why can't I drive it?" And the boys would always say, "No, no, no, no, no, she doesn't need to do that," and blah, blah. And they were really anti about me coming to the farm and I was like, I don't know what the problem is. Like, why are they so anti? And eventually dad had to give in because something had to give because there just wasn't enough people to go around.

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1753s) he said, "No, that's it. Okay, Cass is going to drive the tractor tonight." And then of course, on our way out to the farm, I was going with my brothers and they brought out a CD player, you know, DVD, no, CD player, and you know, started introducing me to music, you know, "But you can't tell anyone." So they were terrified that I was, I was such a goody-two-shoes that I was going to tell on them. And so they had this whole underworld of music happening out there at night because dad was home in bed and [nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1783s) was there to supervise them. And they were terrified of me going out there because I was going to tell everybody.

So yeah, and then I was, of course, once I was introduced to the underworld and I didn't tell everybody, or tell on everybody, then I was, you know, exposed to all sorts of stuff that was going on that, you know, I was just like, wow, okay, there's like a...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1806s)

Smoke and mirrors just lifts, right?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1808s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1809s)

I grew up the same way. I had no friends because my parents were like in the sort of leadership and I was the goody kid, but I wasn't really, but I didn't have friends just to be safe. And then like, and then we end up out. It's hilarious. It makes me laugh.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1826s)

Yeah, so I think what really shocked me in that process was the level of deceit that there was going on. Like you were literally groomed to deceive your parents and the level of deceit that they would go to to keep it from dad and mom, like was just unbelievable. And I mean, that's a whole level of mistrust.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1852s)

It's like two worlds going on. Right. Yeah. Yeah. One of the biggest conversations I had with my parents when I really blew up with them was a conversation. I was phoning them to let them know like, you got the wool pulled over your eyes. Like what happens out here in this world is happening inside there. Like there's no difference between drugs, there's no difference between alcohol, there's a difference between music, there's no difference between bars, there's no difference. The Brethren kids [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1882s) doing the exact same thing that I'm doing.

Like, yeah, there's no separation. And that's what kind of blew us into a fight in that conversation because they just, they can't comprehend that there's a whole other world that's happening.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1895s)

Well, it's that and it's that cognitive dissonance. They don't want to accept that because then that means that they agree that they're living a part of this lie. And also it's happening because the consequences of being caught out are so extreme, so bad that there is this whole polar opposite world existing within the Brethren. The only difference is it happens out here is we don't think we're special people. We don't put ourselves on a pedestal or put people on [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1925s) pedestal. We're just average humans who are flawed and whatever. And the trouble is, the hard thing is when you put somebody on a pedestal or a group of people on a pedestal or yourself, it's very hard to get down off that.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1936s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there was this whole, like they were going out of town and setting up these whole like little discos happening, you know, cars were pumping music and then all these hidden music systems in cars, like under seats and in the backs of the radio and all sorts of things going on. And then you know, the drinking of teenagers and underage kids and, you know, it was just and then the flirting. I mean, there's no sex education in there, so [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=1966s) can imagine like, getting in an environment where you put a heap of teenagers drinking, flirting, you know, whatever else.

And I thank God really that I was considered to be the goody-two-shoes and it was in that sense a little bit untouchable because I feel like it saved me from a whole host of guilt and shame around that, you know. Because when I learned, I didn't really learn that that stuff was going on till much, much later. So yeah, I was just like, mind blown that there was this whole, yeah, as well as the underworld, there was an additional layer of that that I was thankfully sort of [saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2009s) from.

Anyway, I do want to talk about something that I witnessed around that time and it was an argument around consent in the bedroom. I'm not going to go into details, but to say that it raised a lot of feelings and a hell of a lot of questions for me. And I felt terribly confused and desperately needed to get my head around it. But obviously, it's a completely taboo subject. So you cannot ask questions about it or talk to anyone about it [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2039s) even say what you've witnessed, you know, like you couldn't even admit to seeing or hearing what you'd heard.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2048s)

You mean being in the Brethren, you didn't want to talk about it with other people, what you witnessed. You never talk about sex anyway.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2058s)

That's right. Yeah. So I guess what I'm trying to highlight here is what the lack of education in that area and that subject creates. You know, you just, you've got all these questions and all these confusions and you've got nowhere to go with them.

So then I think it was around that time that it was the change of guard at the top. I think JSH was dying and there was all this conjecture around who was going to be the next Man of God. I don't know what it was like for you, Ben, in the eastern states, but over here there was some conjecture about two candidates over here.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2099s)

Yeah, it was the same. And because a lot of, like my mum's from over there, other, like so many people here have relatives from over there, there was like a, yeah, this whole divide of...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2111s)

The whole Brethren, yeah, it seemed to suddenly just overnight just become like split in two. You were either for one or you were for the other.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2129s)

I know that one was like just as toxic as the Hales family. So they were like, they were like, bullied the bullies. The stronger bullies won and then the other one was kind of like a nice, gentle guy. So he was just like shipped off over here and you get your little acreage, you know, not quite, but you know, like, like kings and queens where they fight and the strongest wins. And if you, you know, if you bow the knee and submit to us, we'll look after you. You're still okay to go rival.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2158s)

I'm so glad that you say that, Ben, because like we didn't really know what the hell was going on. Like it was all just like Chinese whispers and you know, like quiet conversations and nobody really knew.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2170s)

And the same, I was only in year seven, but I also was emotionally mature enough to be like, hang on, this sounds a lot like the books I'm reading on history of the kings and something, you know. Yeah, it's right.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2183s)

But did it like over in WA anyway, at least it was decided you're either on one side or the other. And there was this whole bullying going on at school and this whole conflict and they didn't really know what to do with us because I think one of them we related to on mum's side of the family and the other one we related to on dad's side of the family. So where did they put us? Like, oh shivers, like where do you sit? And we didn't know where the hell we sat because we didn't know what the hell was going on.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2209s)

Meanwhile, you're just happy that the attention's off your family drama.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2214s)

We should have just stuck with the Symingtons and not had all these Hales. I mean, we'd probably still be in there.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2224s)

Yeah, but these two were nothing to do with the Hales as far as I know. I mean, I'm sure they're in their pockets, but that was just, yeah, hearsay and I don't know, conjecture. And then heaps of people kept getting shut up, like as whole families, like just suddenly overnight people were shut up as a family for the most ridiculous reason. And it was a lot of them in our locality at least, and it was shocking. And they were really, really coming down on people for compromise, for talking to you. So, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2254s) know, you'd be doing school work with one kid one day and then the next day you weren't allowed to speak to them because they were, their whole family. And so it was just, it was so confusing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2268s)

Oh, sorry, I was going to say, I don't think it, from what I can see, affected here so much with the people being shut up. They're more vocal probably, but I know because the Hales family had like Queensland branch, the Kirkpatrick relation, whatever that is, sorry, yeah, the Kirkpatrick relation, Dr. Roger, then Sydney had out to Athol Greene, sort of Penrith, our way. So that was all like sorted because they were Hales' sister family, and then down to Melbourne where you've got the Bumpsteads.

So [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2299s) roots were kind of like, their main, you know, team group was really sorted on the east. I think it was just there, nothing had happened over in Western Australia with family connections or, well, like marriage or wealth or whatever. So it was kind of like east versus west and wild west. Yeah.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2316s)

Wild west.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2317s)

Yeah.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2319s)

So we got scot-free for a while. We sailed through and we were just like, confusion. And then my brother, he was 15 at the time, was accused of watching TV in a worldly person's house. So we all got confined, the whole family. Now that's unusual.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2343s)

What show was it?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2347s)

Well, the funny thing is, he'd watched plenty of TV and plenty of TV in everybody else's, in lots of people's houses, but he had not specifically been into this particular house ever. So the story gets, it's funnier. Okay, so we got confined as a whole family, which is unusual in itself because usually if one of the kids does something wrong, the parents get kind of shut up with the kid and then the other kids get shipped off, you know, until it's sorted.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2377s)

Just explain, Cassie, to outsiders, like confined and shut up. Like if somebody does something wrong, like watches television and you get caught, you basically get isolated within the household if you're still living at home with the parents. You're not allowed to partake of community meetings, churches, gatherings, speak to your own family members. Like, for example, recently when my grandpa was confined or shut up, he had to live in the back part of the house away from his wife. And these people are in their 60s, [70s,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2407s) like grown-ass adults and, you know, like treated like infectious patients.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2415s)

You can't eat at the same table. They take the meals to them and drop them at the door and they eat in their room and all that sort of stuff. Well, we were confined as a whole family. So it was a little bit shocking to start with. It was like, well, what happened? You know, like why us? What have we done? Anyway, he refused. He was quite rebellious and he refused to admit to something he hadn't done. So, you know, they told him all sorts of things. He was responsible for the whole family being disciplined and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2445s) really came down hard on him.

But, you know, it was the best, actually as a family, it was the only time that we actually had as a family. Like we, it was about 12 weeks and we had all of a sudden, there was no church to go to, no church commitments, no strict, full-on, busy routine. And we were as a family all together, able to sit down for a meal and enjoy a meal and discuss things. Like we had all this time on our hands [suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2475s) and it was the best.

I often say to my brother, it's the only time I really remember feeling like a family because it was the only time that we had time to feel like a family, you know. And we did some amazing things. Dad and Mum, we lived right across from the main meeting hall in Kalannie. So, you know, we had to see them going to church every single day. And Dad and Mum would give us dinner early and then whisk us [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2505s) in the car out to the farm so that we didn't have to sit there and watch out the window while our friends were all socializing across the street. And, you know, we'd go out the farm and we'd drive around the farm and we'd do rallies out the farm and, you know, ride the motorbikes and ride this and that and everything else that we had on the farm. And as a family, you know, that just never happened before.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2527s)

Do you reckon your mum found reprieve in that too, like enjoyed that moment of normality?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2533s)

A hundred percent. Like we used to sit up, mum and me and my two older brothers used to sit up at night after, you know, church had finished or even sometimes during church we'd try and get the kids into bed so that, you know, everyone was in bed. And we'd sit up around the table just chatting. Like for dad, it was very different because he had the responsibility of bringing us back in line, so I don't think he could relax and enjoy it as much. But for us, especially mum and us kids, you know, we'd sit up around the table talking about stuff [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2563s) hours into the night.

And towards the end, that's what the funny thing is, towards the end of the 12 weeks, we started to think, you know, is the sacrifice even really worth it? Like, come on guys, like, you know, like we're having so much fun. This is like, why are we even trying? And then you see, you know, come and see Michael and dad, dad and mum in the lounge room, we wouldn't be allowed in because we weren't involved and we'd be all like running to the [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2593s) the doors and listening as hard as we could to catch any glimpse of conversation because it was just hilarious.

And then we'd repeat it and just be laughing and making fun of it later. And you know, they'd call Michael, "You're just a contentious young man," because he wouldn't admit to something that he hadn't actually done. He just refused to cave to them. And yeah, the very, very funny times that we had.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2621s)

It's so interesting to hear that, Cassie, because my auntie that lives in Western Australia, her family and her, my cousin that's out now, she told me a very similar story that her whole family were out for so long and they never ever decided, they got to the point where the Brethren actually brought them back because they weren't going to come back. They were like, "Actually, we enjoy this family unit, we enjoy this life, we enjoy going away as a family and experiencing what that is for real." And they're like, "Oh, we're actually [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2651s) to lose them, so we better bring them back."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2652s)

Hearing a similar story, like how many other people have done the same thing and just have not, like try it guys, leave and try it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2663s)

You stole my punchline, Ben, because that's exactly what happened. Me and mum and my brothers were sitting up late one night, dad was already in bed in his pajamas, I think mum was even in her pajamas, and we were just sitting up late when the priest hadn't come to see us for about, I think it was two weeks. And we were wondering, I don't know why they didn't come last week, but anyway, we're happy out, so whatever.

And then like it was, you know, probably 10 o'clock or 9:30 at night and knock, knock, knock on the door. Mum was like, "Oh, shivers, who's that? Like what on earth is going on?" So we all, you know, went to the front door and mum was like, and then there's one of the priests standing at the front door and mum was like, "Oh, oh, oh, do you want me to go and get Ken?" Because that's the default, you know, it has to be the man of the house that takes a message. So you know, "Do you want me to go and get Ken?" "No, no, no, we just wanted to let you know that you're free to [move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2717s) around again."

And mum was like, "What? You mean we can come back to the meeting?" And she was like, and he was like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, we decided that you're all free to move around again." Anyway, so it's never been clear, but that's the thing, Michael had never backed down. He'd never said that he'd done what he was supposed to have done. Like it was just, you were free to move around again. So away we went back to church. So it's almost like they got wind that, yeah, we were starting to wonder if it was worth it and so they had to just quickly scoop us back before it went too far.

So yeah, that was [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2762s) most strangest thing. Anyway, as you can imagine, Michael, I shouldn't say his name, but anyway, Michael, he didn't take that too well and he just started to get even more rebellious. So he started playing football and doing all sorts of things with the local team and of course that's completely outlawed. And mum obviously was terrified then, she started to really see that she was going to lose him. And so she wanted to send us away, send him away for encouragement. I'm sure lots of you have heard [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2792s) the encouragement trips.

So she, but this wasn't quite like this because this is my mum was driving it. She sort of wanted to send him over to my auntie in New Zealand and she had to sort of get it by the priest and, you know, whatever else. And eventually it was agreed that he could go over there, but I had to go as a chaperone. So lucky me, I went as the chaperone to my auntie's place. And I don't know how, it's just very convenient, but there happened to be three-day meetings, of course, in the place where we were going. So away we went to stay with [our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2833s) auntie in New Zealand and there was three-day meetings there.

And look, we had a, oh, do you know, funny thing, in the airport on the way out, I bought my first digital camera and they were outlawed. That was so naughty. Here I was, the good chaperone girl, and I bought the first digital camera. Oh my goodness.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2851s)

I remember the controversy. I remember that point in time where it was like, are they allowed? Are they not? No, there's like a screen on it, you know.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2860s)

So yeah, I just bought one in the airport as we were leaving. So anyway, of course, at the three-day meetings, this whole digital camera was quite an iconic thing because, you know, nobody had digital cameras. So that was my little, you know, being different. And when we were over there, we had a ball. As you do, like I can't say that, you know, all the social gatherings and all of that wasn't fun. It was, you know, they always are.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2888s)

Away from your own home, away from the toxic environment you grow up in. Like New Zealand, the best time. Overseas, the best time.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2895s)

Yeah, yeah. Anyway, in church, one of those three-day meetings in the church, I noticed a fellow over there had his eye on me. And he was making it very obvious and so I did the old yawn trick. Oh, and sure enough, he yawned. Sure enough, he yawned back.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2918s)

Is this a...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2919s)

Did you not know?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2921s)

I'm gay. I didn't know these like little techniques that the straight people did in the church.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2926s)

Well, I hadn't been told about this and Michael and my brother didn't know about it until just the other day I was laughing about it. But yeah, it was, I just wanted to see if I was imagining it or if it was real. So I just yawned and sure enough, he yawned and that happened about three times. So I fairly knew that, okay, this guy's got a bit of a liking to me. Anyway, so after one of the churches, he sent his sister along to ask if [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2956s) could call because, I mean, that's all you could do really in those days. You could just call. And I was quite rebellious at that stage, like in a sense that I just said to him, "No, you tell your brother to come and do his own dirty work." So I wanted him to come and ask me himself.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2974s)

This is what I love about Western Australian women. This is why I love Western Australian women. They are boss bitches. Don't take anyone's shit.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2983s)

Yeah, that happens in Canada as well. Yeah, oh, and Canadianâ€¦

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=2987s)

Yeah, so along he came and, you know, "Can I call?" And so yeah, I said to him, but I was very clear to him straight away that I didn't want to talk about getting married until I was 21, which was already pushing the envelope because at that stage, we were all supposed to get married at 20\. So if you had a fella, if you were talking to a guy, he was supposed to get married at 20\. And I was 18 at the time and I was already trying to buy myself some time because of, you know, obviously what [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3017s) knew of a relationship and what I was afraid of.

I was already trying to push that timeline out, not really knowing what I was doing, but I was just determined not to even think about it until I was 21\. So I'd said to him, "I'm happy for you to call, but I don't want you to talk about marriage until I'm 21." So we talked on the phone, you know, weekly for the next 18 months and kept it quiet, luckily kept it very quiet until one of my brothers got drunk at my uncle's house on a Saturday evening and spilled the beans. And then everybody knew that, you know, "Oh, Cassie's going to marry this guy from New Zealand," and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

So then the pressure began to mount and it was always the question, "When are you getting married? When are you getting married? So [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3068s) are you getting married?" I mean, I'd seen this guy once and I was talking to him on the phone, but the whole idea of getting married to him was just the next level. So eventually, the pressure just got so much that the more the pressure built, the more scared I got. And eventually it got so intense that I just decided, stuff it, I have to see him again before we get married. Like I felt like there was no out, that this is what I had to do.

I [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3098s) to get married to this guy. I'd been talking to him for two years, so this was just my pathway and it was planned out for me. But by damned if I was going to get married without seeing him again at least. So I asked if I could see him again before we got married and I outlined my concerns about, you know, submission and consent and all the things that I was concerned about. And I was told I had to write a letter to BDH, so this fella, this new leader that I'd never met in my life.

And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3129s) was having to write a very, very personal letter explaining why I should be able to see this guy before I get married. So I painstakingly got this letter together and explained all about my concerns of what, you know, about submission and consent and how I felt like I just really needed to see this guy before I made that decision. And I was then told I had to fax it to [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3159s). And I was like, well, that's a bit odd, no one has fax machines.

So I had to go to a worldly person's business to fax this highly personal letter to a fax machine when nobody has fax machines. So why am I faxing to the leader when we don't have fax machines? That's a bit odd. But anyway, so away I go down to this worldly person's business to fax this thing. And, of course, receiving fax machines, they're busy running hot, receiving faxes from all around the world, that [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3189s) took an hour and a half for me to get that fax to be received.

And I couldn't leave it there for it to send. For goodness sake, the content of the letter was so personal, like I couldn't be leaving it there and I was terrified that one of them would come along and read it. Like, oh, I just remember just shaking, I was terrified that somebody would get to see this letter before it got to its destination. Or little did I know when it got to its destination, it would be [sent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3219s) to hither and thither and everywhere else. I don't know, I don't have it. I burned it because I was like terrified that somebody might read it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3229s)

Still got a copy?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3230s)

This is how terrified, this is how awful it is. This letter I wrote, I was terrified anybody else would read it and it was intended for one person. Anyway, I finally got it to receive and then weeks went by, nothing, nothing, nothing. Then I got a call from one of the priests in Perth, one of the leaders in Perth. So this is a whole other locality that doesn't even interchange with us. And he basically called [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3260s) and said, "You're making a mountain out of a molehill."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3265s)

In terms of your request for...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3267s)

In terms of my concerns, in terms of what I'd written in the letter. I can't go into that, but I was making a mountain out of a molehill. Essentially, I could see this guy, but he has to come across for three-day meetings in Kalannie. So I don't know whether I influenced the three-day meetings in Kalannie, but it was convenient. It was very convenient that there was suddenly three-day meetings in [Kalannie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3297s).

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3297s)

I think they named them Cassie's, Cassie's Kalannie, Cassie's three-day.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3304s)

Well, yes, anyway. So he booked his flights, this guy booked his flights and then they found out that he booked for two weeks. He was coming for two weeks and there was outcry because he was coming for too long and that we couldn't see each other for that long. And they had to scramble and get an arrangement for him to be whisked off down to the other end of the state so that we couldn't, you know, meet up or have anything to do with each other because, you know, God forbid we actually spoke and got to know each other. That would be scary.

[Anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3334s), I remember being just totally confused about this because there were girls in my locality that were dating guys in the same locality and they saw each other all the time and they were, you know, talking to each other every week. But I was asking to see this guy from New Zealand and I was restricted to three-day meetings, full-on, you know, chaperoned visit, you know, that was all, had to be pre-arranged. I had to write to the Man of God to ask if I could even see him. So it was a very odd [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3364s) of paradox.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3368s)

You know, everyone I've ever heard have been so forward and like, "I want to talk about consent, I want to see this person again before I marry him." Like if anyone can be trusted, it's you to be able to go on a date or see another guy again without the fear of something untoward happening. It's you.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3388s)

Yeah, well, the thing is, talking about it with my brother the other day, it's almost like they didn't want me to realize that I didn't know him. Okay, all right. So it's fine if you're in the same locality because you do know each other in a sense, you kind of have grown up together so you do know each other. But if you're coming from the other side of the world, there's a good chance you have no idea who each other are. And goodness, you don't want them to get to know each other because it may not happen, right?

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3419s), it's almost, that's almost what it feels like happened. They just didn't want me to realize that I didn't know him. And sadly for them, the changes I saw in him when he went home raised a lot of questions and reservations for me as to whether I could even go through with it. I started asking questions openly about the scriptures, "Wives be subject to your husbands." I had an argument at work with one of my [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3449s) cousins about that scripture in particular.

And he was saying ridiculous things, like he was telling me, "No, grandpa killed himself because my grandma wasn't submissive to him," and all sorts of ridiculous things.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3463s)

This potential future was, you're saying?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3466s)

No, no, this is my second cousin. I was having an argument with him at work at lunchtime about it. And, you know, he was saying all sorts of things, making claims about my grandpa killing himself and stuff like that. And I said to him, "Okay, you tell me this, when you get married, to what extent are you going to hold that scripture over your wife? Wives be subject to your husbands. To what extent are you willing to hold that scripture over your wife?" And anyway, he [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3497s) laughed at me and went back to work and I thought that was the end of it.

No way. I got a phone call within 20 minutes and I was called up to the priest's office, strangely, one-on-one. I don't know what happened to the whole witness of three, but suddenly in this environment, in this situation, it was a one-on-one. And he grilled me. He said, "I hear you're questioning the scriptures." And I said, "No, I'm not questioning scriptures. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3527s) asking to what extent those scriptures are held over a wife."

And he said, "Well," and we went round and round in circles, round and round and round in circles and I wouldn't back down. I said, "I'm not questioning the scripture. I need to know to what extent you're going to hold that over me when I'm married." And eventually, I feel like looking back on it, he wanted me to say it. He wanted me to say it. I said, "Well, rape. Like, are you going to hold it [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3557s) me?" So in the case of rape, is that what you mean? Is that what you're trying to tell me? And he couldn't answer the question and he turned around and he said to me, "Are you sure your mind's right?"

Oh, my God. And it was, I swear to God, that moment was like a light bulb went off in my head and I'd never, ever considered leaving until that minute. It was like a light bulb went off in my head and I just knew that I had to leave. I was not going to survive in that environment and I was not going to let history repeat itself. And I was not going to become the next basket case because that scripture was held [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3605s) me my entire life.

And I just knew I had to get out. There was no other way. I just had to get out. The feeling that came over me was just, I just can't explain it. It was just like, I don't even know how that conversation ended, but it was just like, oh, okay, all right, I've got to do this. And I never, and it's weird because I'd never, ever, ever imagined in my life that I would ever leave. Like, it never crossed my mind. I was that goody-two-shoes little girl doing [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3635s) the right things. Never ever had occurred to me that there was an option. And that was it. I just knew then, right, that's it, I have to get out.

So then I had to figure out a way to break it off with this guy that I was talking to. And I just was terrified. I just didn't know how to do that. And, you know, he used to ring and he'd expect me to be there for the phone calls and I was avoiding the phone calls and that was making him very upset. And one night, I was talking to him for hours and hours in the dark at night on the phone. And I don't even know what the conversation was about. I literally can't remember, but it was hours.

And then right at the end, I just knew, just a feeling came over, it was now or never. And he said something about getting married and I just said, "I can't marry you. I don't know you [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3694s) I just can't marry you." And in that moment, I literally shattered him into a thousand pieces and it was the most horrifying experience, like just listening to him break and beg and plead and, oh, it was just horrible, really, really, you know, horrible feeling of having to just shatter somebody like that.

And I hung up after about 10 minutes of listening to him just sob. And then [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3725s) must have sat there for another half an hour just shaking in the dark. And then I got up and walked through and mum met me in the, I can still see it today, mum met me in the living room. She'd come to check on me and she met me in the living room and she could just tell by the look on my face, you know, I was completely pale and she just took me in her arms. She didn't even say a word and we never discussed it. Never discussed it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3750s)

Yeah, she knew that.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3751s)

Yeah. So the fallout from that was awful because I was really ostracized within the family, within my friends, within the community, because the opinion was that I'd led him on for two years.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3768s)

The woman is the problem. Always the women are the problem, particularly if they're smart.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3772s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3774s)

I'm so like, impressed by this, Cassie. You're so in tune with yourself, which is very unheard of, particularly in women.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3782s)

Yeah, well, I was a problem then, wasn't I? Not really. Yeah, so that was pretty, I went into a pretty deep depression then because I was just ostracized from everyone. You know, there were expectations. I was, you know, one of my cousins had married one of his friends and, you know, we were all going over there. It was all going to be happy families and it was all planned, you know, he had the house and he'd sent me pictures of the house and it was all, you know, just signed and sealed really. And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3813s) for me to break it off was just uncalled for and just completely, you know, unacceptable.

So yeah, I refused to go to the church because of the ostracization there, like the way people would treat me there and just turn their backs on me and stuff. I just thought, not stuff it, I'm not going. So I didn't go to church and I just went to work and I came home and I ate and I slept and that's pretty much what I did for, I don't know how long, it was quite a while anyway. And during that time, because I was the harlot, [during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3843s) that time, there was a lot of stuff, but you know, I just wanted to talk about one story.

So me and my brother were at the local bottle shop, which was also the pub because it was such a tiny town, it was the bottle shop, the pub were one. And we were there, we were getting some drinks and another young couple came in that were in the Brethren to also buy some liquor. And they were chatting to us and then there were some other [non-community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3873s) members there as well and some young guys and they sort of joined our group and we're having a chat and they said, "Oh, do you want a drink? Let's have a drink together."

And me and Michael kind of looked at this young couple as if to, you know, like they were older than us, so it's up to them, it's their decision, right? Because he's the older responsible male. So we kind of looked at him and he goes, "Oh, yeah, why not?" So they all got a bottle, you know, and we had a drink. Anyway, it wasn't until [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3903s) later I found out the story went around that I was caught in the bottle shop with this other, not community, non-community member. So this worldly boy, I was caught in the bottle shop with this worldly boy drinking out of the same bottle. So that's how the stories, like Chinese whispers, you know, like if you want to sling on somebody, you'll make it up.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3933s)

It's that whole projecting and controlling the narrative. That that other couple, older people probably went home, felt guilty, confessed about what happened, twisted the story. You're already the underdog, so let's label her with the rest of it and it's believable.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3951s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3951s)

Classic, classic example of schoolyard bullying that happens in every locality or church meeting.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3957s)

Yeah, like I couldn't work out why. I went to Perth one time and actually did go to church because I didn't really have an option. And the girls that I used to talk to at Perth just wouldn't even come near me. Like they were treating me like I was completely leprous. And, you know, I couldn't work it out. And it wasn't until ages later I found out that that was a story that was going around about me at the time. So, you know, the guy was a bit of a drug dealer, a known drug dealer in the area. So, you know, oh, my goodness, you know, what an awful thing to do.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3992s)

That's the beauty of coming on how many years later and telling the truth, hey? Telling the truth.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3997s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=3997s)

I just want to clear up some stories, okay? I do not share drinks. I can afford my own own bottle and I'll pay for my own.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4008s)

Yeah, thank you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4009s)

I mean, if they tell stories like that about you when you're in there, how much more do they tell stories about you once you're out, you know?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4021s)

Essentially, I learned later on that my reservations about getting married weren't unwarranted and I was absolutely right to call it off. But you know, that's all passed anyway. My brother was playing football at the time. He was still playing football for the local team and I was in this deep depression and knew I had to break it. And so one time at lunchtime, I was down at the local shop for lunch to grab something for lunch.

And I walked to the front of the shop and was leaving and I saw across the road the netball coach and the netball umpire were standing across the road [chatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4066s). And it was like something came over me. It just was like, "Now or never, now or never, now or never." And I just, I remember like in a trance, I crossed the road and just approached them and asked them if I could come along to netball training. And it was like, I'd never spoken to them before. I knew of them, but I didn't really know them.

But it just felt like, this is the, I have to break this depression. And this is just what I have to do. Like, it's just now or never. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4096s) just crossed the road, asked them if I'd come along to training. And they said, "Yeah, yeah, come along on Thursday." So that's how I broke the bubble. I started playing netball for the local team, which was obviously a massive no-no. And yeah, it was really...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4112s)

What's netball? Sorry, I'm Canadian.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4113s)

It's like basketball.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Okay, that's what I wondered if it was.

### **Cassie Davies**

Yeah, yeah. Team sports, so very, very outlawed, and especially with outsiders. So yeah, I played netball for a while and that kind of burst a bubble. Like, I mean, it was a harrowing experience in itself, just being exposed to a whole world that you don't have any clue about. And especially me being [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4143s) sheltered and so focused on being in the Brethren that I'd never looked out before. So everything was shocking to me. Everything was, you know, like it was just an overwhelmingâ€¦ 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4156s)

Sensory overload.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4157s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4159s)

Because you had never even been to high school with worldly people.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4162s)

No, it was a complete culture shock.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4163s)

A complete culture shock.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4165s)

Yeah. Anyway, so then mum and dad put up with that for a while. And you know, like they'd obviously berate us both. Me and Michael would travel together to football and they'd be at us all the time. One particular day, it was a home game, so that was in our local town. And I drove my sister, my sister wanted to come down to watch and she was eight years younger than me. And she wanted to come down and watch and she was either going to [ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4195s) her bike down like she had before, or she was going to jump in the car with me. And she jumped in the car with me.

And I drove her down there. And anyway, after the game, we lost that game and mum knew that I took losses very harshly. I was very competitive. And when we lost, it really grated on me. Anyway, she knew that I took them really bad and so she played on that and she got at me about the loss. And I just went to bed and said, "Stuff this, I'm not [listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4225s) to that crap, I'm just going to go to bed." So I just went to bed.

Later on, Michael then came home from football because the football game was always after the netball and they both went at him. And I remember they were yelling and screaming at him and I got out of bed to go and defend him. And they turned on, or dad especially turned on me and said, "You're a bad influence on your sisters and you're not welcome in this house anymore." And I just looked at him and said, "All right then," and I just walked back up to my [room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4255s).

And I got my keys and my wallet and I walked out. And I remember my younger brother saw the look in my face and he knew that it was serious and he went and jumped in the passenger seat of the car. And I got in the car and I said to him, "Andy, just get out of the car, just get out of the car." And he said, "I'm not getting out." And he was terrified, he was shaking. And I said, "Get out of the car." And he said, "I'm not getting out." I said, "Just get out of the car." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4286s) eventually he just looked at me and then he just got out.

And I just drove off and I drove and drove and drove and sobbed and drove. And I really knew that this was it. Like, I just got the sense that, not this is it, I've got to do it. Like, it's, you know, I'll show them. I'll show them that, you know, you tell me to leave, I'll leave. And I just drove and drove and drove into the night and I was driving for hours and just crying. And I didn't even have a [phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4316s), I didn't even have a mobile phone.

And I rocked up, I suddenly came to my senses and I was miles from home in, you know, hours away in this other little country town in the pitch black night, no mobile phone or nothing. And I suddenly came to my senses like, where are you going? Where are you going? Because I had not made a plan or anything. I was just driving. And I thought about it and I was like, there's my mum's older brother I could go to, but I'd never spoken, he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4346s) wicked, wicked. Like we'd been told all our life that, you know, he was like the devil.

And I was terrified to even think about going to him. And then I thought about my other uncle and auntie that left seven years before. All I knew about them was where they lived. I knew that, you know, there was my uncle and auntie and they lived in this area of Perth. And so I thought, stuff it, I'm going to have to call them. I'm going to have to call them from a phone box. Didn't even have their number. So I went [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4377s) the phone box, rattled around, got some coins together out of the car and went to the phone box.

And I rang the directory and asked for my uncle and auntie's, you know, in this area. And they gave me the number and I rang the number. My auntie answered and she had to try and guide me to her place with no mobile phone and no idea where I was. Tried to [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4407s) me into Perth and to where they lived. And then I got almost there and had to call her again from another pay phone and she said, "You're just around the corner," and she was able to guide me to her. And yeah, that was just a phenomenal experience. Like that's how I got to my uncle and auntie's house.

So there I was at my uncle and auntie's house and I think I asked her to ring mum and tell her I was there because mum would have had no idea where I was going or where I'd gone. [She](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4437s) would have been heartbroken, like I can't even imagine. So yeah, I ended up there and then I was there for a couple of months. And I mean, I look back on it now and I think my poor auntie, she had this 20-year-old, a 12-year-old essentially, in her house. Like, you know, no experience, no worldly experience, completely, I had no computer skills. I couldn't just go out and get a job. I had absolutely no computer skills and no experience in an interview, no experience in any of that.

I didn't even know what I was doing. I just turned up on the doorstep and, you know, she had her own family to look after and she now had this extra completely dependent 20-year-old that was more like a [12-year-old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4487s). It's just the most bizarre situation. But anyway, they were amazing. They didn't, you know, they just let me kind of find my way. And I was there for a couple of months and then my granny was sick and I was told by my auntie that there was no one in the world, nobody else in the world that could help get my granny back home to Dalwallinu.

It needed to be me. I had to. And to a certain extent, I was like, well, it's my chance to see granny again, right? So I'll go along. Back in the Brethren. Yeah, back in the Brethren. Yeah. So I'll go along. So we drove up. We went and picked up granny from the hospital she was at and we drove home. And then we had to stay the night all of a sudden. Then we had to stay the next night, then we had to stay the next night. And you know, like, what's going on? You know, are you going to take me back to Perth? "Oh, no, no, you know, granny still needs some care, so we need to stay another night."

Anyway, eventually I said, "Get me back to Perth. Like seriously, this is getting beyond a joke. I want to go back to Perth. [Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4557s) me back." And so my older brother came with me and we went back to Perth with my auntie. And when we pulled in, I went to get my case out to take it and put it in my car and my brother put his hands on the case and he said, "Where do you think you're going?" And I said, "I'm going." And he said, "You're not going anywhere." And he held on to the case and I said, "Yes, I am. I'm going."

And he said, "No, you're not going anywhere." And then my uncle came out and all my cousins came out and they were like, "Just come in for a drink, just come in for a drink, just come [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4587s) for one drink." And I was like, and then another cousin and her husband pulled in the driveway and essentially locked my car in so I couldn't go anywhere.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4597s)

It's the same story. Just one drink. We want to have a chat with one drink.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4603s)

One drink, just one drink. And then of course, my uncle calls a drink that's, you know, like 50-50. So, "Oh, now you can't drive, just stay the night."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4613s)

Yeah, same cookie-cutter tactic they use on everybody. One drink and one priestly visit and then it's all downhill.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4621s)

Yeah. And then my cousins, my three cousins, bless them, sat up with me all night and brainwashed me essentially into staying with them and living with them and, you know, everything was going to be rosy and it was just going to be fine. And so I did. I ended up staying with them for a couple of months and we had the best times because we were, like, I didn't really care. Like, I was already the harlot and I was already the absolute, you know, whatever else, the bottom of the bottom. So I didn't [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4651s) care and we just had the best time.

And then, bless my poor auntie, she got it in her head that I was going to have an affair with one of them. So I had to be shipped off very quickly. Like, I mean, seriously, your first cousin. It's just sad. It's just so sad. I just feel sad for them that that's the way they think. So yeah, I was shipped off then to another uncle and auntie and then I witnessed that uncle whip my other cousin with a hose and I stood up about that. So then I was shipped back home eventually.

And then Michael was then being put under a lot of pressure to make a decision because he'd had it by that stage. He was dating an outside [girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4694s) and playing football and doing all the wrong things. And so he was told that he had to make a choice between his family or his girlfriend. And he was told one night that, yeah, he wasn't welcome in the house anymore. And I just went and sat on the bed with him and I said, "If you go, I'm right behind you." And he was gone then. He was gone.

And then there was a massive focus put on me and I was told like, "If you leave now, you'll be responsible for him not coming back," and all the rest of the stuff that they tell you. I was sent away for meetings, you know, encouragement, and [sent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4733s) away to Albany for meetings. And yeah, and it was just, I was already disassociated. So I don't remember any of it. I just remember going down there and I remember coming back and I remember thinking on the way back, well, my case is already packed, so I'm not going to unpack it.

But that was noticed by my sister that I didn't unpack my case. And so she wouldn't go to sleep that night. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4763s) were, I was in the same room as my younger sister, she's eight years younger than me. So she was about 13 at the time, I think, maybe younger, 12 or 13\. And she noticed that I didn't unpack my case and she couldn't, she wouldn't go to sleep so I could go. So eventually I let her go to sleep, went to sleep and let her go to sleep, but I set my alarm under my pillow.

And then I got up in the [morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4793s) and just skittled out the door as quickly as I could and got down the street in my car and realized I didn't have fuel. I had no fuel in my car. And in the tiny country town that we were in, there was no, like, service station that you could go to and fuel up and go and pay. It was a card system. There was like this fuel bowser, but you had to have a special card to get fuel from the fuel bowser. And I was like, "Oh, no, no, [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4824s), no."

So what do I do now? So I snuck back in the house through the laundry door and damn it, I walked straight into my little sister walking through the living area coming looking for me. And she said, "What are you doing?" And of course I was dressed and she said, "What are you doing?" And I was like, "It's all right, it's all right, go back to bed, go back to bed." And she was like looking at me and I said, "Just go back to bed, go back to bed." I said, "Look, look, look, I'm going back to bed." And I climbed back into bed and pulled the covers up and waited and [waited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4854s) and waited and waited. And I think eventually she was asleep, I think, and I just legged it. And I got one of the cards out of dad's office and I legged it and went and filled up and then I was gone. So yeah, that's how I got away the second time anyway.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4876s)

Did you have like moments of, just like the outside perspective, did you have like moments of, and also insiders that probably feel the same way, like because I know that the fear of God and God's discipline and that's the Lord speaking to you. Like did you have moments of that, like when you didn't have the fuel card? Was it like moments of like, I don't know how you thought...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4898s)

Strangely, not then. Not then, I didn't. Strangely, I was so determined. And because Michael, and because at this stage I knew I had Michael on the outside, I didn't. And I think by then we'd already actually sat down and discussed it and we said, no, it was either then or after, we said, you know, bad things will happen to us. It's normal, it's life. If something bad happens, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4928s) not because we've left the Brethren. Yeah, yeah. And I think that's so important to get to that. Yeah, yeah. We'd sort of made that pact that, you know, like if something bad happens, don't immediately go to, "Because you've left the Brethren."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4944s)

Yeah, and it's so important to get to that mindset and also like have a network of supportive people that are out. Like I've got that amongst my close friends that have members that have left and you do have those moments of reassurance. You're like, you know, I've ended up in hospital, I've had this or that happened, or you have a feeling down and it's like, it's not, you know, just as long as you can be aware that this is life. Talk to any other human and we all, we all suffer. It's not a fairy tale reality [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4975s) it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4976s)

It's a hard one to reprogram though, right? At the beginning, it takes years to get that out of you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4981s)

Yeah, yeah. I'm like seven years out and just thinking it now.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=4985s)

Yeah, oh yeah. I still find at times like I revert back and I'm like, oh, and my whole, even my self-esteem and self-worth and all of those things, they've taken a long time and I'm still working on that, still working on those because that's a journey. That's ingrained in you.

And then, you know, like I see my mom and she's the most talented and kindest person and the most thoughtful. She would do anything for anybody, but I see her and she's got such low self-worth and I just think, you know, the potential for you is just incredible. But I just, you know, you've been beaten down for so many years that there's just nothing left of you. And that's where I think they [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5033s) to break you because they have to, your identity essentially has to be superglued to the church. So they can't, if you're a strong person and you've got a strong personality, you're going to see through that and you're going to break that. But if they can break you, then you become so glued, your identity becomes so attached to the church.

Because what happened after, so that didn't end there because after that, my mum and dad actually left for a while. So it was around the time, I don't know if you remember, Ben, where they started closing down some of the smaller localities.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5074s)

Yeah.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5075s)

I don't even know what happened there. I wasn't in, so I don't know.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5079s)

You mean particularly in Western Australia they did?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5081s)

Yeah. I wasn't around, so I don't know what the directive was, but suddenly dad had to sell up the farm and they were moving everyone out from Kalannie, which was a tiny little country town, which went against, it contradicted previous ministry about never being able to close down a place that had held the Lord's Supper.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5104s)

Yeah, and also, but you find that because with the new reign in terms of the Hales family, like a lot of historical things that have been said that, you know, well, it's kind of like, clean the slate, new set of rules because there's a new family in. Like it's, well, that doesn't matter. It's what's current, it's what the pull of our day says that goes, right? Yeah. I believe in the same way they do it here now, they shut down those smaller meetings is when they become too hard to control.

[Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5134s) bring it in, then the people off to areas that can be, you know, collected or like controlled, closer to the front, closer to the center, which is where the current leader is or powerful leadership is. So really strong supporters, be that Melbourne, be that, you know, where they've got stronger personalities that are, you know, cookie-cutter copies of, not that they're the same, but like of the leadership. Yeah. So that's why they would close them down because Western [Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5165s) and New Zealand historically have been, I don't know so much about the rest of the world, but like just in terms of, they historically have been like troubled, you know, always a test, always, you know, a difficult one because they're so rebellious.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5179s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5180s)

And you get that even here. Like you sort of went out from Windsor over the mountains to like Orange and then further west, it was always known that you guys kind of had your own accent or you had like, it was like a certain type of twang and the girls were more strong-willed or powerful than the, you know, like and the guys kind of liked that, but it was to a point. And one thing you said about being beaten down so your personality is like nothing, like you're a robot within an [army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5210s).

I remember the leader's son-in-law saying to me, my old boss and priest, saying to me at one point that, you know, if they can't, like I was creative and always will be, so they were like, "We can't like beat it out of him," but he rephrased it to be like, "We'll channel it, we'll use it, you know, we'll use you how we can, you know, we'll find a place for you and and our beloved brother would [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5240s) that, you know, if we could channel you and use it rather than, because you know, some of us are just not like..."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5246s)

Not moldable.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5248s)

No, I was born to break molds.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5251s)

Yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah, so it was around that time anyway that I think, you know, Dad and Mum, I remember a conversation that I had with Dad actually and I said, when we heard about it, we specifically, I said to my brother, like, "Dad and Mum have to get out first. They have to get out first. There's no way if they get out last, they won't get out." They won't sell the house because, you know, like it was a tiny little country town and all these houses suddenly go on the market. Oh, yeah.

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5281s), like I was like, you know, so I remember I rang dad and I said, "Dad, if you have to go, get out first. Make sure you're one of the first to leave because if you're the last to leave, you'll never get out. You will never sell the house." So smart. And anyway, apparently, I don't know, this is just what I've gleaned, but apparently they put an application in to go to Mundaring and the Brethren in Mundaring didn't accept, wouldn't accept them there.

So they basically [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5312s) mollycoddled or it's like, I mean, fancy having to put an application in to move somewhere anyway. But anyway, that's what they had to do. And so they put this application, they did all the paperwork and put this application in and then it just was weeks and weeks and weeks and it was toing and froing and, you know, nothing, no response, no response. And then people were leaving, people were leaving, people were leaving. Months later, people were still leaving, leaving and still mum and dad were there.

And eventually, oh sorry, I've got someone blowing, is that too loud? Have you [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5342s) background noise? Okay, good. So then, yeah, mum and dad sort of followed up on their application. They were told that they'd filled the application wrong or something like ridiculous. Like something absolutely, like it was evident, it was very clear that they were just not wanted in Mundaring. And dad and mom, I think, got very disgruntled over that and then they ended up leaving.

So they were down in Perth at one stage and they had been to meetings and then they were all in the car as a family and from what I can understand, they said to the kids, "Right, that's it, we're going to go and see Michael and Cassie." And shock horror, you know, from the [older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5390s) kids like, "What?" You know, like that's just the next level of sin, you know, to go and compromise. So they said, "Stop the car, stop the car, we're getting out." And, you know, dad and mom pulled over and they rang my other auntie that was in the Brethren and said, "Come and get us."

And I think, you know, like apart from the three youngest, the rest of them got out of the car and went with my auntie. And so dad and mom rocked up at our place with the three youngest kids, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5420s) out of the blue.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5420s)

It's so sad that your brother and sisters, like in my own, are brainwashed to believe that religion and rules first, rather than a family, the safety of a family, the love of a family. Like, yeah, why not take the opportunity? And it's that's sad. It's conditioned into every generation.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5438s)

Yeah, so that was all, that was really like, it was great for us, like a miracle. And we had the best times and I reconnected with mum and was able to explain to mum why I left. She said, yes, explained to me her absolute heartbreak and how she felt like I deserted her and all of that. And I said to her, "I had to save myself, mum, you know." And she understood, like she knew, she understood. And I was able to give her that understanding. It was like, "Mama, history was going to repeat [itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5468s)."

Yeah, I had to, like I was not going to let history repeat itself and she knew, like obviously.

Yeah, so I was able to have that all with mom and then she, you know, was terribly worried about one of my sisters that had remained in there. And obviously some of the things that I was telling her about what I'd experienced growing up and she was terribly worried about her and being unprotected and whatever else in there. And so she ended up going back, I think they both went back at some point. And then dad left again and came to live with [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5507s).

And then it was really weird because we were like reverse roles, trying to parent him. He was like a teenager letting loose in this, you know, completely outside freedom and we were trying to parent him. And we were trying to forge a relationship with somebody that we didn't know. We were seeing his personality for the first time ever. You know, there was this person, he had a personality, he was, you know, he actually was a person. So that was just really very awkward and a really difficult position to find ourselves [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5537s).

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5537s)

And then did you find, sorry, I was going to say, did you find with that, Cassie, like I found when I saw my sister six years later, did you find that like you've lived, right, and grown and changed, right? They're still that same person. Do you find it really hard to connect and really hard to like, because what you're connecting on was six years old, like six years ago?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5557s)

I never had a connection. I never had a connection. Yeah, yeah. So it was like suddenly this person who was my, and I was supposed to be, you know, supporting and caring and loving, but I didn't really know who he was. And then he was also in a world where he was suddenly free and making all these choices that maybe weren't great choices in our eyes and we were kind of trying to parent him. So it was a very, very weird sort of situation to find ourselves in.

And [meanwhile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5590s) mum was back in, trying to keep the rest of the family together. But essentially, I think because of the contact that she was still having with dad, she was desperate to hold on to, you know, to not let him go, that essentially one at a time the kids all moved out and she was left completely alone in the house because of the contact she was still having with dad. And then eventually she left again and came and lived with us all. And I think from my understanding, it was always [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5620s) intention to try to convince dad to go back. So she kind of thought in some way that if she stayed with him, he wouldn't stray, you know, and she could convince him to go back.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5633s)

At this point, are all the kids still in and sort of...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5638s)

Yeah, all the kids were then back in the Brethren system. And I think there's this whole Stockholm syndrome that happens where their identity is so superglued, yeah. The thought of losing that, having them removed or losing them is more horrific to you than anything else. It trumps everything else because your identity is actually them, you know, that's that [Stockholm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5668s) kind of...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5669s)

And if you lose the kid, they could go to hell. Like, you don't, if they die in there, at least they're going to heaven.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5676s)

Even in this case, a spouse, you know, even in this case, a spouse. Like, yeah. Again, I'm not going to go into details, but it got very toxic. Like they were living together in our house and it got really, really toxic and we felt like they shouldn't be together. And my brother asked Dad to leave because Mum was extremely vulnerable and extremely distressed. And that was an awful situation again. You know, we essentially had to kick Dad out of his own house that he was paying rent at. And mum then spiraled out of control. She was suicidal and we were taking days off work one at a time just to be with her, just to stop her from doing something.

And eventually we managed to get her to check herself into the mental health ward at a local hospital. And, of course, she wasn't able to say what was really going on, you know. I tried to persuade her to, but she just, she couldn't find it within herself to actually tell the reality. And so all I could do was insist on she had women practitioners only. So I insisted that no, no male practitioners, only women, try and give her the best chance to actually open up.

And then I was super grateful that she ended up with a therapist that helped her to understand her basic human rights [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5767s) give her more tools in assertiveness and give us, you know, some guidance in being more assertive. And then all of a sudden, you know, relatives that were in the Brethren started rocking up at the, we'd come to the hospital to see mum and they'd be there. And then they started taking her out for day trips. And then I could see that they were taking control of the situation again and there was nothing that we could do.

And [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5797s), I sat down with them at one stage and tried to explain my concerns around, you know, her safety and the toxicity that, you know, I was worried about. And he hushed me so that he didn't want his wife to hear. So he was hushing me, telling me to keep it down because he didn't want...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5822s)

In case she could relate, you mean?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5824s)

I think so, possibly, possibly, I'd say. And then next thing, we lost contact. They whisked her off up to the country again and we lost contact. And then next thing we know, we heard that dad was back home as well and that he was also living, you know, they were living back together and everything was rosy. And of course, we felt absolutely devastated about it all, but there was nothing really we could do at this stage. And fast forward and that's pretty much [status](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5858s) quo. So, but anyway, our life is incredibly free and incredibly fun and we've both got two kids now and very busy as you can imagine with two little ones.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5874s)

This is your family we didn't go through.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5876s)

Yeah, that's my family now. So yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5879s)

Such a beautiful photo, Cassie. I love it.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5881s)

Oh, thank you. Little rascals, very cheeky. Keep me very busy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5891s)

What a gift you're giving them though, right? Like that's the thing, is that's the gift we're giving our children, is we're giving them freedom.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5899s)

This is where it's called, yeah, well, it kept me strong because I always, whenever I had doubts in those early years, I just said, "My children will not have to go through what I went through." And that's what kept me strong. You know, I'm very big on breaking generational trauma and I do a lot of work. And even you say, you know, the hangover is, is, you know, like it's generational, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5929s) ingrained and it's indoctrination. And there's a lot of work to be done to break all of that, but I'm very big on that and I do it constantly. I'm constantly working.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5938s)

Yeah, that's my life mission too. Same thing, working that generational trauma. I'm going to go back, I want to go back to your, this is you and all your siblings. Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to show this.

This is one of the very few photos of us all together because my youngest sister was five, not even five, four and a half when I left. So, and she was my baby because I was the second eldest. She was my baby. I, you know, like as I said, I was doing schoolwork and rocking her through the night. I used to take her to mum to feed and take her back and put her to sleep and I was mum to her. She, if she fell and hurt herself, she would run to me, you know, it wasn't mum, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=5980s) was me. And to leave that behind was really, really difficult.

And then there's that, my little sister wrote me a poem the night that I left the second time. And you know, I said she came and met me and she knew something was up. She sent me this poem and I can't hardly read it because it's so, it breaks me every time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6006s)

It's titled, "You Ran Away."  
Oh, the times that we had together,  
hanging out in your Nissan Pulsar.  
Sometimes we'd laugh all night.  
Very rare we would get in a fight.  
You ran away. My heart was broken.  
That very day you ran away.  
You were coming home from Albany.  
You've been there at the weekend to stay.  
Didn't look very happy to me.  
Wondered whether it was World War III.  
You ran away. My heart was broken.  
That very day you ran away.  
It was that night when you said to me,  
"Tell me when you're turning out the light."  
You then waited till I was asleep.  
Then you crept away without a peep.  
You ran away. My heart was broken.  
That very day you ran away.  
Now I lie in my warm bed at night.  
I think about all those little fights.  
Then I look at the bed beside me.  
Makes me cry when I see it's empty.  
You ran away. My heart was broken.  
That very day you ran away.  
A hot flannel, cold water and a glass,  
thought that I was being way too nice.  
But now I'd fight forever more,  
just to have you back with me once more.  
You ran away. My heart was broken.  
That very day you ran away.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6066s)

Oh, that's so beautiful. Yeah. She was very talented, very talented. But it really captures what, from her perspective, sorry.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6081s)

It just, it captures how these potent rules that they have breaks and shatters a family and how many people get caught in the aftermath of it. And that is why we do what we do, right? We want this to stop.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6105s)

I think, you know, who knows who they're going to marry, but I just feel like the system and the upbringing and the rules and the regulations, it's actually breeding bullies and it's breeding environments where this abuse can happen and go undetected. And even if it is detected, it's so buried. Like I don't believe that most of the members in there, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6136s) I think my mum would think, you know, she was an issue in her sorrow and suffering, she thinks that, you know, she should be rewarded in heaven or whatever else.

I'm just trying to be a little bit careful what I say because I don't want to give away too much. But for example, you know, Heidi's case, it's not isolated. They are taught to, if something bad like that does happen, they're put into a bubble. It's put into a bubble and it's like, "Oh, it's just an isolated case. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6166s) just an isolated case." You know, it's the only very rare isolated case. It's not, this is a thing, it's not an isolated case. And so each person thinks that they're the isolated case. Yes, exactly. If they could actually understand that it's so widespread and it's so, I do the numbers and I think, okay, it possibly would have been me. I know of one of my cousins that was lucky to escape. She's still in there, but she [escaped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6196s) in a way that she didn't have children, so she was allowed to divorce and return home to her mom. So, you know, that's my cousin that I know about and then there's just so many others that I know about and it's so rampant.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6214s)

You're talking about like things like abuse, right?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6217s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6218s)

Yeah. So in the same scenario, I have 11 friends, close friends that have helped me or a part of my life, random Brethren that we've all come together with a similar trauma, right? Out of the 11, I think six of us have had sexual abuse, one to the point of rape. Like you do the ratio of the math, that's over half. One is one too many, right?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6240s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, I mean, there's so much I could say, but I have to obviously be careful.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6250s)

Yeah, you're respectful too.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6252s)

Yeah, I'm trying to be respectful and I look at and I do have compassion for the victims in the sense that they just don't realize how they're not the only one. And if mum could get some kind of understanding of how many are in, you know, awful situations, like, it would blow her mind. She has no idea.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6280s)

You know, they don't talk. Sorry, I was going to say, yeah, go on.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6286s)

Sorry. Just say, for example, my brother saying to her, you know, "Oh, just hang on a minute, take a step back and think about, there's something happening." He's talking about Heidi McCamley's story and he said, "You know, something's happening for Cassie that is very triggering for her right now." And he started to explain the situation to her and, you know, she gets that. And you know, he said to her, "You know, try to have some compassion when you're talking to Cassie." And she just switched on a dime. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6317s) it's, they don't understand that these things are happening. Nobody knows, like they isolate it so much that nobody knows that it's happening.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6326s)

I think what they took out of everybody in there is they remove their capacity to have compassion, right? Yes. And they don't realize that compassion has been squeezed out of them. And I think it happens with, I've run into with ex-members too that still don't realize that it's, they make you so in your head, they make you live in your head and the heart is just cut off, right? The [compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6356s) is just squeezed out of every soul in there that if just everybody could just come down into the heart, it hurts. It hurts so bad to exist here with what's going on. But if we can just get into our heart together, things are going to change. Like inside and outside, things will change if we can get into our heart. We have to get into our heart.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6379s)

Yeah, the reason it has to be squashed is because it has to be conditional. Like it has to be able to be turned off at a dime when a family member doesn't do the right thing. You have to be able to switch it off. So it's not unconditional and it can never be unconditional. It has to be conditional. And if, and that's not real. Like if you have to have compassion that is conditional, it's not real compassion.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6407s)

And I mean, we've listened, we've probably all listened to Heidi's recordings of her recent priestly visits. Yeah, I mean, like there's no compassion in them.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6420s)

Yeah, yeah. Part of that goes back to the whole control factor. You see it in death, you see it in birth, you see it in marriage, you see it in everything about them. Like, okay, so if there's a death, they don't travel, they don't support each other, they bury them quickly. So therefore, they're shutting out all the emotion. And the reason for that is then they can control you. Yeah, if you can shut off people's emotions, they're easier to control.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6450s) you can see it even in a birth, like it's not celebrated in there the same way as it is, you know, in other places that you go. A death, and if you got really emotional about a death, you were being, they would call you sentimental or, you know, if you wanted to visit relatives or have relatives stay with you, they made a big deal of it and called it Moabitish.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6474s)

Or natural affection.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6475s)

It's all about controlling your emotions.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6477s)

Exactly. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6478s)

Yeah, it's all about controlling your emotions so that if you don't have the same emotions, you're easier to control.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6486s)

And there's a whole psyche in that too. Like when you take somebody's basic human rights to show affection or love or be in touch with your emotions, you take away them so incrementally that somebody doesn't realize when you say, "Okay, we're closing down this church. You've got to up and move 30, 40, 60 years of your living there and your businesses," or "Your son leaves home. You do not speak to him. He's dead." Like they wouldn't have that sort of control if [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6516s) didn't start with a very basic human fundamental thing such as like crying or showing affection or love.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6524s)

I'm a bit of a prophet because I said to dad, "If you're not the first out, you'll be the last." Well, guess what?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6534s)

I just love how smart you are, Cassie. I'm like, you were so intelligent.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6539s)

One thing that strikes me, just while you were talking and just saying, "Well, you know, nobody knows the extent of it in there. Nobody knows how rampant it is." But there are a few people who know, and those are the big leaders and Bruce Hales himself. These people know, they could give you the statistics. They've got it all in their filing cabinets and they're the ones that are so responsible because like the grassroots people who are suffering, they're kept very, very ignorant. But the people at the [top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6570s), the people who run the place, they know what a hellhole it is. Yeah, you know, I really struggle to have any sympathy for them because they're so responsible. They know what's for those people. Yeah, exactly. The cover-up, aren't they? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6586s)

And they do know, they do know because they are across so many cases. And then there are certain elder leaderships that that would come across similar things. Well, they're sort of brought into the fold of the hierarchy higher up and kept within that privileged space just so that they don't themselves go, "Hang on, there is something wrong here." Like if you're kept within that privilege or that pedestal that's a bit closer to the top, then you're not [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6616s) to, you're not going to say anything against it because you're reaping the benefits of being a part of that.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6620s)

Yeah, well, it's controlling the propaganda, isn't it? I mean, it's, you look, it's no different to Putin and Russia and, you know, he's not threatened. He's not trying to keep people out of Russia. Nobody wants to go to Russia. He's trying to keep people in Russia. He's trying to keep the narrative. You want to hold on to the power, hold on to the power in Russia and keep people in Russia and he controls the narrative. He controls the propaganda. He controls every element of their life. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6650s), you know, it's no different. Nobody's trying to get into Russia. Nobody wants to go to Russia.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6655s)

And you know, and again and again, you notice he's running a sterile country. He's taking a lot of the emotion out. You know, somebody disobeys him, he'll shoot him on the street and then nobody can cry over it, nobody can get upset over it because Putin did it. You take all the emotion out of people and they're easily controlled.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6677s)

And then you're ruled by fear, essentially.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6684s)

Like, I know that's an extreme, but when you're exposed to such extreme forms of punishment, for example, on a lesser scale but still extreme in the Brethren, where you are isolated within your own house because you've done something wrong. You have to sit in the naughty room for however long. Like that childlike isolation, it's so extreme. There's no room for compassion, there's no room for human error because, well, it's this or that. Like it's black or white. And if you do, you're evil, you're wrong, you're punished. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6714s) you're terrified to do anything outside of those bounds. And if you do, you do it in secret, so you're no different anyway.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6721s)

Yeah, and if you look at what constitutes, you know, why people become bullies, I was reading that the other day and it was mind-blowing. It's every element of why people become bullies was evident in there. Your lack of control, like essentially you become a bully and then you become an abuser. And I was looking at the reasons that people become bullies. And one of them is helplessness or lack of control. [Well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6752s) you don't have any control from the minute you're born. Your life is planned and mapped out for you. And you have no say as to what goes, you know.

So I'm not saying that everyone becomes bullies, but it's a haven for bullies. Because, you know, you've got a lack of control from the very get-go. And then, you know, you're witnessing, maybe you're witnessing a toxic environment at home. That's also another one.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6779s)

And that's a new norm, right? That becomes normal. You don't know any different.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6782s)

Yeah, and then you've got a perceived threat and, you know, you go after someone else to bring someone down. Well, we all know about that. And poor self-esteem. You're taught from such a young age to self, you know, self-hatred and self-loathing. Self-loathing and self-hatred, that's just another reason, you know. And they're all in there. Every element of why people become bullies is in [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6812s). And then they wonder why they've got such a huge issue with bullies.

I remember a story, one of my uncles had been kicked out and he was fighting for his kids. Well, no, at this stage, he wasn't even fighting for his kids. He was trying to get right according to them. And he was sent out to live on the farm out of town because it was a tiny country town. So he was sent out to live on the farm and he had no food on a weekend. And we were a tiny country town with no shops open on a [weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6842s).

So he'd come into town to try and get some food. And the priest at the time, no, I think dad spoke to him, saw him and spoke to him and said, "What are you doing? You know, why are you in town?" And he said, "I'm out of food. I need some food." And so dad went to the priest at the time and said, "Look, you know, he's desperate, he's got no food." And he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6872s) to him, "What's he doing in town? Tell him to get back out where he belongs." No compassion, no empathy, nothing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6880s)

And the very system they create is that system. Well, any of us, you'd go and get a sandwich for the guy, right? Or give him some money to give him food because there's no shops. But no, I have to go and ask approval somewhere else because I'm an adult, but I'm already compromising.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6897s)

I'm already compromising. So yeah, but that's constant. That was constant. Like, and that's what you witnessed and that's what you were slowly conditioned. Like I was thinking about, you know, women from such a young age are given subtle messages that aren't even said, they're not even voiced. But you think about from the very get-go, you're silent in church and you're in the back. So that's a subtle messaging. That's a very subtle messaging that you're inferior and you [don't...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6928s)

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6928s)

You don't have any voice in the church meetings. Just for outsiders, there's no microphones back where the women sit. The men sit in the front, which is called the center. The women sit around. They don't partake of church. You don't converse or, you know, the whole scripture, "Come let us reason together," doesn't apply if you're a woman. And you sit back and just give out a number for a hymn. Like that's your service. That's it. And then you've got people like Cassie and Cheryl and Carman who are actually smarter than most of the men in the front row. All of them. All of them. [All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6958s) of them.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6959s)

I'll take that, Ben. Thank you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6961s)

Yeah, the women are, I tell you, like the women I've come across in the Brethren that are still in there, like, and I know some of them will watch this and have because they've reached out. You are the smart people. What are you doing in there?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6974s)

Yeah. It's not as fearful as you think it is. There's so much help out here. That's the thing is there's just, there's so much support out here, right? And if one of us goes down, there's probably five to come back up in this place, right? Like there's just so much support out here.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=6994s)

There was one woman I used to work with and she was so brilliantly creative, she could have run Vogue. And, like, I hope she listens to this and realizes that because she could be out here running the editor of Vogue. She was so talented. But they hated that. They put her down. Yeah, there's just so much talent in there as well that is wasted.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7016s)

Yeah, Ben, it's funny you say that because one of my missions is to find the little four-year-old that I was in kindy that was told by my kindy teacher that you will be Australia's first-ever woman prime minister. Oh wow. She said that too and I lost her for years and I've got to find her. So look out when I find her.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7039s)

Julia, I'll vote for you.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7042s)

I know, Julia got in. I was devastated. I was like, "Damn it, I wasn't quick enough."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7046s)

There's other roles, Cassie, there's other roles. We'll have a TV host, don't worry. We'll have a TV show.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7054s)

That's the kid I look back then and that's the kid I was. I was a real go-getter. I wanted to and even in primary school, I can still hear my teachers saying to me, "So Cassie, how about, you know, whenever there was a group activity, how about we let somebody else be the leader this time?"

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7077s)

Right.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7083s)

Message for Bruce Hales, hey?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7087s)

You do lose sight of that. Like, you know, by the time I left, you know, I was a shell of that person and I'm finding her, so look out.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7098s)

And it's a self-esteem and being able to like, even just little things that reminded me when you said that, I really struggled to take compliments. Now I'm like, "Yeah, hit me up with a compliment. I'm cool with it." I used to really struggle. I'd get really awkward. I'm like, "What do you want?" Like one of my best mates, she's like, "Can I just be nice to you?" And I'm like, "Sure, I'm not used to it."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7121s)

I know, what do you want from me? Usually it's like, yeah, that's what I say.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7125s)

Where are we going with this? What, you know, what's the objective here? It's probably yawning.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7131s)

I just wanted to finish on like, so for me, my solution going forward is I would like to start, I know this podcast has just been incredible and the stuff that it's covered is just really eye-opening. And I wanted to possibly piggyback off it and talk about the solutions and what people are doing to move forward and really tap into that. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7161s) so I guess I want to make a platform for people who are in that situation and thinking about leaving and to see a story that they might identify with, but then to have the solution, to look at what they did that worked for them, what they did that didn't work for them, where they are now, all their successes. I want all the success stories. So my mission is to start a podcast that piggybacks kind of off you guys and then looks at the solution.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7192s)

I've been of a similar mindset, Cassie. So we could collaborate on something like this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7197s)

Yeah, and you know what? I think this would, we'll talk after we're done recording this podcast. I think, right? I think this is really good. You guys can get together an email and that we can ship out for people to send you guys messages and emails on this. So we'll get more clear with it and then you guys can find an email that people can email you to.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7223s)

Because everybody's trauma is different, everyone's trauma is different and so everyone heals differently. So I just want to make like this huge pathway of solutions and what people have done to move forward.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7237s)

And the thing is too, Cassie, they're so similar. So it's really good to be able to say, "Well, hey, this person did this, this person did, you know." Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7247s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7248s)

Yeah. I agree. I think that's a brilliant idea.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7251s)

Oh, go ahead, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7252s)

Yeah, no, I was saying it's a brilliant idea. I mean, a few other people have said the same thing, that could you have a podcast that kind of focuses on the success stories? I think it's an excellent idea.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7261s)

Yes, I like this idea better though. I like this idea because it's more focused towards solutions and an active, it literally is the next domino, right? We've got this podcast that is, everyone's bringing up their trauma and telling their stories, right? And as you can see, we're at two hours of this and you can't get to that part. No, that's all good. It's all good.

And it is, we do need the next domino, which is like, where are we going with this? So I prefer this personally more than people telling success stories. I think it needs to get into what are the solutions, what is the activist part of this, [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7297s) can we go from this? That just lights every fiber of my being. I love that.

And on the same note, Cheryl, I think the same. Like I've envisaged at times where I'm like, I would have loved to with a certain friend or relative that's left, I would have loved to have shared her story. So with you guys, what she went through, you know, talk about, and you get to the end of the story or the episode, as I've noticed with listening to you guys, and you're kind of like, "Well, what happened? Like, where did they go? How did they go?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7327s)

Exactly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7328s)

The next part of the episode is like, "So two months ago you heard on Get-A-Life podcast. I want to check in with XYZ and tell you about what's happened." And like just get like these because there's somebody else could be wanting to take those steps, right, in a similar situation, went through everything the same, but it's like, "Well, what happened next?" you know, and that's the biggest question.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7350s)

Yeah, I love it. Stay on, stay on, Cassie, when we're done recording and we'll have a quick chat. And yes, thank you so much for coming on. It was such a pleasure. I loved every minute of it. We apologize to all the viewers and listeners for the long podcast. It was much needed. It's okay. Hopefully you made it through. Take it off in little tiny chunks if you needed to. But yes, thank you so much, Cassie. Much love to everybody. [Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVXRuAcOcCg&t=7381s) you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848â€“1882) â€“ Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882â€“1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903â€“1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953â€“1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970â€“1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987â€“2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002â€“present)
