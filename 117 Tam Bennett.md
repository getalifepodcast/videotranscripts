## Summary

Join us as we dive into Tam Bennett's letter she wrote to the entire PBCC community when she left with her brothers in 2018. This letter addresses all the reasons why we continue doing what we do. We discuss the judgment that is placed on any diversity; the lack of empathy, compassion and kindness towards non-community members, especially those that are non-Caucasian; their fear tactics they use on children; their restriction of information that takes away the right of anyone making informed decisions; the lack of diversity in career choices; the hierarchal system that disadvantages weaker members; the system that disallows any room for creativity and most of all the God-like status they give a man. Tam dives into the racism, sexism, and what it was like for her to grow up in a cult that doesn't embrace gay people. The most rewarding part of this podcast is the shining light her and her brothers can be as she offers hope to those inside that leaving with family is possible. Her message to those inside at the end will leave you with chills from head to toe!
We end the podcast with a song from another ex-member. Dawson is a 24 year old British/Swiss artist and songwriter and is getting his start in the music world. His songs are very personal and moving and very relatable for the LGBTQI community. He finds comfort and strength in journaling his feelings, emotions, and struggles through writing his own songs. His experience of leaving a controlling cult and plunging into a world where everyone is accepted the way they are inspired his song, Rainbow Lovers.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=53s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get a Life Podcast. I'm Cheryl, an ex-member of the PBCC, and I was there until I was 17 years old in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. Today joining me is another ex-member, Ben Woodbury from Windsor, Australia. And we have a very special guest, Tam Bennett, joining us from Adelaide, Australia. And she's going to tell her journey whilst in the PBCC and how she made it out and is now living a very thriving and fulfilling life out in this beautiful world that is [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=83s) condemned by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. So welcome Ben and welcome Tam. Thanks, you guys, for coming on, and especially to you, Tam, for coming on and sharing your story. I am going to hand the floor over to you and you can take us along your journey of your experience inside the PBCC and how you were able to escape it.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=103s)

Okay, um, well thank you for having me on the podcast. I really appreciate it, um, and thank you for inviting me. Um, so I guess, um, I'll start with how we left the PBCC. So my two brothers left with me. Um, we left in December 2018, um, and that was after a long lead up of planning beforehand. So we'd been planning for at least a year beforehand to, um, to leave and [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=134s) we basically packed up and left one morning. And, um, actually the next day I got, hopped on a flight and, um, traveled to Spain to, um, stay with my ex-girlfriend who lived in Spain at the time. So it was quite a big period of change at the time, very sudden. Um, and yeah, so my brothers and I, we all live together, we have a house, um, and yeah, we have a great life now. No regrets.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=159s)

What year did you leave?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=161s)

Uh, 2018, [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=164s) December, like end of 2018\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=168s)

So it's just, just recently.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=169s)

Yeah, yeah, five and a half years, I believe.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=173s)

And how old were you?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=175s)

I was 25, I think. And my brothers are younger than me, so they were about 22 and 18\.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=184s)

Okay. Yeah, that's such a young age to leave. Um, do you, what do you want to run us through, like what got you to that point and your thought process? You mentioned your ex-girlfriend, so obviously there was that to [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=200s) into it. Um, yeah, run us through that, because we don't get many people. Obviously I've got a couple of friends in my group that are part of our community, but I just, yeah, I'm interested. I'm always interested in particular for the women that come forward.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=217s)

Yeah, yeah. So obviously, um, being a lesbian was a big part of it, but it was definitely, definitely more than that. We just, ethically speaking, we had such a big problem with everything about the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=230s). Like, we disagreed with so much about how they run things. The, you know, just the sexism, the homophobia, the racism, everything. We've written it all out in this letter that we left for the Brethren. We left it to, we actually addressed it to all the Brethren in the whole world. Um, obviously they wouldn't have ever seen it because it's not something that the president would ever like read out in one of their meetings or anything like that. But it was something we wanted to do, um, for them. And I guess I was probably the first one in the family to start [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=265s) those doubts. It would have been years, years and years before we ever left. And for a long period, I just thought, well, I'll just stay in, keep my head down. I guess I'll never, you know, have a partner or have children. Um, but I'll, at least I'll have my family. Um, because I didn't realize, yes. And then I can't remember how it happened in the end, but we ended up talking because we were always very, we were very close, and we ended up talking [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=295s) it. And, um, I realized that they were also starting to have the same doubts and, um, same, you know, feelings about the Brethren as I was. And yeah, one thing led to another and then, um, we were actually making solid plans to leave.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=312s)

So yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, in some way I'm a little bit jealous that, you know, I didn't have, yes, I had a couple of cousins that I knew were leaving after me, not at the same time, but it would have been, I guess, a burden shared, a burden [halved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=326s) if you were, you know, co-conspiring with family to escape this, which is beautiful.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=331s)

Yeah, it was, it was the best possible way for it to happen, I think. Like, I feel so, so lucky that I had them with me and that we've just, you know, they've, we've been together since.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=344s)

So just to get the understanding of the dynamic, so it was you and two brothers?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=349s)

Yes, two brothers. So two younger brothers, yep.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=353s)

Did you have any other [siblings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=356s) that you talked to? They're in or like, did you know parents or wow?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=361s)

No other siblings. Um, our parents knew that we disagreed and that we weren't happy, but they were, you know, still behind the Brethren and they were trying very hard to get us to change our minds. Um, yeah, I have, I have nothing bad I want to say about my parents. I think they're good people trapped in a bad system.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=380s)

Yeah, most of them are.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=382s)

Um, and yeah, I [appreciate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=386s) them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=388s)

Yeah, I think collectively that's how we all feel. Like, we, I love my family and I think everybody would say the same, but I think that's why we do what we do, right? It is what we, we're fighting for our families, right?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=399s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=402s)

How did you start showing signs that you didn't agree with, like between you and your brothers? Like, I'm just, we talked to a lot of insiders, and I mean, this is going to be very inspiring for them, right? There's going to be so many families, like brothers and sisters, that are all thinking this but don't talk to each other. So how did you form that relationship where you could start talking about the things that you disagreed on and [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=426s) have the fear that, oh my goodness, my sibling's gonna rat, tattle-tale on me and I'm gonna have a priestly visit? Like how did that, how did that start for you guys?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=435s)

I guess there was a number of different factors. One of them, obviously we were very, very close, so that was the basis that it was all founded on. And then I think part of the reason behind us being that close is that, well, frankly, our family wasn't particularly popular. Like we didn't have a lot of friends or relatives.

My grandparents came in from the outside. So there wasn't a whole lot of connections, like sort of family connections or other social connections.

And in general, I think they were looked down on quite a lot, like the Bennett family. And I think that that was a good thing. Like, I think that that helped us. Like we felt like it was just our little family sort of against everyone else. And, you know, some of us got bullied at school, like out of me and my brothers. And, yeah, we just didn't have a really great experience socially with anyone else outside our family, sorry, in the Brethren. Um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=495s) we, yeah, we leaned on each other. Like we were each other's best friends.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=502s)

That's so amazing. Like with the group and the social network we've come in touch with, and I think you can probably say the same, Cheryl, like even, even I've never heard of like family units being so strong together within, like within such a minority, like a minority within the minority, if you know what I mean. Like that's amazing that you three were able to find that and lean on each other. So it was just you three kids in the whole family, like just three siblings?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=525s)

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=525s), no other siblings. Yeah, that's amazing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=528s)

Amazing.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=530s)

Yeah, it is amazing. My brothers are amazing. I really, really value the relationship we have together. And yeah, I think that the Brethren trying to erode that actually. Like, I really think they try and erode family relationships and sibling bonds and, you know, just bonds between family in general. Um, and it's for a reason, and this is the reason. Because I think someone who leaves on their own is so much, has so much less [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=555s) a support system to lean on when things get, um, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=560s)

Yeah, I agree. How did you know that that you didn't fit the mold of a typical female in there and in the world and society altogether? Like how did you, how did that come about? And what did you do with it? How did you deal with it, I guess?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=579s)

From when I was really, really young, I knew I just wasn't the same. Like, it just felt different.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=585s)

And you do, don't you? Yeah, you know something you can't even put your finger on when you're little.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=590s)

Um, and then I don't know, I guess I heard about, when I was about 10, I heard about that being gay was a thing from a kid at my school, which was like a secular school because back then they didn't have the Brethren school for primary age children. Um, and yeah, obviously [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=609s) because, I don't know, I guess you recognize something in yourself and you just have a really, you know, sharp reaction in the opposite direction, and I was like disgusted by that, um, which is obviously like self-directed in hindsight.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=626s)

Definitely. And you often find that, right? The most, you know, loudest homophobic people are generally suffering with, you know, internalized homophobia.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=634s)

Yeah, absolutely. Um, and so, and then I think the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=639s) time I realized consciously, I was around 14 years old. Um, and yeah, I remember I was just standing outside after a meeting with a group of other girls my age, and I was just, I realized I was just sort of staring at the girl opposite me and thinking how beautiful she was and how I just wanted to, like, you know, kiss her cheek. Um, and it was such a powerfully terrifying moment at the time. Like, I just turned around, [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=669s) speak to, you know, I just turned around, walked away, went into the bathrooms and freaked out in the toilet. Um, and yeah, and I remember thinking at the time, this is it, this is the moment that, you know, I always remember. I knew, but then I was like, no, I can't, this can't be my life, this can't be me. And so I kind of went really hard in the opposite direction, and I tried really hard to be like straight and to be, um, you know, interested in boys and stuff. And I would, you know, do this thing where I'd sort of like scope out all the boys who were eligible, I guess, and be like, okay, that one is, that one seems suitable. I am, as of today, deciding that I will have a crush on this person. Like, just a really sort of, um, you know, conscious decision that I was going to, um, pick that one to have a crush on, which obviously is not how crushes actually work.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=728s)

And then, this is so familiar, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=731s) it's very refreshing to hear.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=733s)

And then if I ever felt like it was being reciprocated, like they were actually interested in me back, I would be immediately like, oh no, actually, no.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=746s)

And you changed, you changed to the next person?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=749s)

Yes, exactly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=752s)

Yeah, I relate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=756s)

And, you know, I guess the reason why I want you to expand on this is I, you know, we do have people who are closeted in there that we're talking to right now, and they find it very, very refreshing to be able to hear you guys tell your story, how you came out, how you dealt with it. Um, and every single person that comes on here, I mean, you're only the second female we've had, but it's the same thing where it is that push-pull, where you realize it, and then you realize, oh no, I can't, and then you go in the opposite direction, and then you come back to the middle and you're like, okay, now what do I do? How [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=795s) I, how do I enter myself into this life? What are the things that I've got to do? So yeah, if you could expand on that a little bit, like when you finally realized, okay, this is who I am, and then did you realize I'm gonna have to leave?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=808s)

Yeah. So, um, it was actually, it was really, I'm kind of like sort of deciding how much to say because I also don't want to, you know, crush anyone else's chances of going through the same thing, but I guess...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=823s)

We can decide that sometimes the tips are good because that's, then they're able to utilize the same tool.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=830s)

Yeah, just to support you on that, I think you'll be very surprised how many people will take that and use it. So yeah. Yeah. So I don't actually know how things are now since it's been, you know, five or more years since I was having that experience. But, um, so basically when you're at school, they do the really, really tight blocks on all the computers and everything and you can't really search anything or look at anything without being, um, you know, tracked or checked on. Um, but then I started work [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=860s) of course I'm like just 18, um, doing full-time work and I suddenly have like almost unrestricted access to a computer.

And the work blocks are not very good to be honest. And like they just sort of block certain websites, you know, but they can't block everything and they can't block you Google searching and stuff like that. And so I guess I started work and then I had access to this computer and I was slowly like searching stuff, you know, like, am I gay? Um, and just finding out about the rainbow community and and and [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=901s) gay stuff in general and what the experiences of other lesbian and gay people and other people in the LGBT community were.

And I guess to start with, it was just sort of like, I told myself it was just like, you know, fascination, curious, sort of horrified fascination. But then, like, you know, I don't know. I don't think I've never been good at dehumanizing people the way the Brethren do to gay people, when other people are in minority groups. And you know, I just kept thinking, well, you know, if people love each other, what's the problem? Surely there's nothing higher than that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=939s)

Yeah, if you love [each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=943s) other, it should be, you know, it's a good thing. How is it not a good thing?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=947s)

Um, and yeah, I guess it just sort of like very, very gradually over many years, um, progressed to the point where I was like, okay, yeah, I'm going, I'm able to accept that about myself. It was obviously, it was more rocky than I've just made it sound. Like, I remember one night where I sort of really realized, I thought I was bisexual, because that's sort of like, you have this sort of...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=973s)

[It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=973s) a safe bet, right? People might accept you if you're bisexual, and then you might accept yourself.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=980s)

Yes.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=981s)

But don't worry, that that's not just, if you're in the Brethren listening to this, it's not just like, that's not unfamiliar out here either. Like, I have a lot of friends in a friend group that talk about people that are bisexual on their journey to come out. Um, yeah, you know, because it's safer. Like my first boyfriend, he was bisexual, but then he realized...

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=999s)

My partner's bisexual too. And, um, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1003s) fine if you are bisexual, that's also great.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1006s)

Yeah.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1007s)

Um, but for me, that wasn't the case. But, um, at the time, that's when I had my crisis, when I thought I was bisexual. And I remember I was calling up the QLife text chat line because by that time I'd actually got myself a contraband computer of my own, so like one that wasn't from UBT at all. I just went out and bought it. And so I had that where I could, again, do more research and find out more and sort of, yeah, [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1034s) what things were like on the outside. And so, yeah, I was on this chat line basically freaking out to some poor person on the other end who's paid to help people through their gay crisis. Um, but yeah, after that, like it was good to be able to talk to someone. I think I said to the person, are you gay? And he said, yes, I'm a gay man. And I said, you're the first gay person I've ever talked to. And yeah, it was a really big moment.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1062s)

Um, obviously it gives me chills. I remember that feeling of the first person you ever speak to that's gay, and it's just so strange because, well, for me, the irony was that it was a sex worker. And I just never had felt more heard and safe. It was just such a strange feeling.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1084s)

Yeah, it's, yeah, it's incredible. And like, obviously I must have talked to gay people because, you know...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1091s)

Don't they say one in ten people...

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1093s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1097s)

You just wouldn't have known.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1097s)

Yeah, in the community. But, um, it was the first person I knew who also knew that they were gay, I guess.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1104s)

So that was, yeah. And how did, did you ever come out to your family? Like, did you ever, like how did you bring it out to like your parents and your brothers? Like how was that for you?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1115s)

So to my brothers, I guess, because it had been like a process over many, many years, just gradually, like we would get a little bit more and more safe with each other to talk about, oh, yeah, I don't agree with this, like, um, I don't agree with that. And, um, I guess it got to the point where I was like, well, I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay, which they were like, yeah, well, me too, I don't really think there's anything wrong with that as well. And that very quickly after that, I felt comfortable to tell them, well, I think that I could be attracted [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1145s) a woman, hypothetically. And yeah, so it was, it was done basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1151s)

Yeah. And so when you, did you have to have any priestly visits over this or did you, were you able to escape with this kind of intact?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1160s)

I, yeah, I escaped and no one knew because you get very good at lying, don't you?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1167s)

Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1169s)

Hiding the truth. Um, yeah, so no one, I think people suspected that we were not happy, but I don't think anyone really realized how far along we were, that we, you know, bought a house together, that we'd, um, you know, made solid plans to leave. Um, and so we didn't actually, I think we had a few people who were like overly interested in our [situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1196s) who would come up and talk to the boys after meeting and, you know, that kind of thing they do where it's like very, very obviously trying to scope out, you know, where you are at spiritually or whatever.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1209s)

So aside, aside from you having that, you figuring out that you're gay, let's put that aside and let's dive into just being a part of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and just dive deeper into the reasons why you decided that this church wasn't for you.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1232s)

Yeah, I mean, I guess part of it was we, we just didn't believe anymore, to be quite honest. Um, and but it's more than that because like, you know, some churches are, um, good, full of good people. Like, they don't have these very bad, but like, we just, like I mentioned before, the obviously the sexism, racism, all the isms. Um, but just the way they treat people, the way they divide families, they break people apart. They, you know, children grow up believing that they have a devil inside them, that they're wrong and bad. And I think that's true for all Brethren children, not just people, you know, who are in our community.

I think that, you know, you get taught from when you're just a tiny child that you've got sin inside you and like, um, I don't know, for me it was like once I turned 12, because I'm such a bad sinner, I am bound for hell. Um, and you just have this gnawing inside you and eating away, and like it's just evil. I think it's, I genuinely think it's an evil thing to do to small children.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1306s)

On top of what you were saying, the untold anxiety [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1309s) pressure that places on a child. Like we can all vouch for that. Like it's unnecessary and it's of no wonder that most often or not, the first opportunity you get to drink, because that is the only crutch you have, it then becomes, you know, your life set, like the way you cope with such a toxic environment. How was your thoughts or views on the drinking culture within the Brethren?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1334s)

They did it. Luckily we managed to never, I guess probably because we had each other to support each other. Um, and our parents weren't really strong drinkers, another reason why no one really liked them very much. Um, but yeah, I don't know, I think we managed to just skate past that luckily. Um, but we saw it happen all around us and it was just, yeah, terrible.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1359s)

I guess it's another reason why you didn't fit in then. Like it's, it probably means [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1368s) probably means why you had such a solid unit is the reason you didn't drink. Like you had, you didn't have that pressure because your family was so supportive of each other.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1376s)

Yeah, yeah. And I hate the feeling of losing control. And because I always knew I had secrets, the thought of anything that could make me spill those secrets was freaking terrifying. Like no way. I'm sorry, I guess that was half of it too, I think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1390s)

And did you, did you attend OSG, OneSchool Global? Did you go to the Plymouth Brethren school?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1395s)

Yeah, I did.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1397s)

Yeah. From how was that for you?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1398s)

Um, well, great. Um, it was an experience. I was, um, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1406s)

Did you experience any homophobia there? Were you bullied?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1409s)

Oh yeah, I think, yeah, I was definitely bullied. Um, I remember getting called a lezzer at one point. Um, I don't know, it's just sort of offhand, like no one knew, I don't think. I think I was pretty good at hiding it. Um, and you know, I wouldn't say fitting in. I was always kind of a loner because like, I just felt like I couldn't talk to everyone. Like, you know, no one really got me or whatever.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1439s)

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1439s), which is a very cliche teenager thing to think, of course. I suppose everyone thought that.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1445s)

Yeah, but we kind of had a point.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1448s)

And I guess in some way it's a silver lining. Like being ostracized or an underdog or bullied, it makes you all the more resolved, I think, in the decisions you make further on in life. Like, I know for my own case, it's really helped me to know, well, hang on, I never ever fit in there. I never ever had an enjoyable experience there. So I, [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1469s) than ever, never would return.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1471s)

Absolutely, yeah, I totally agree with you on that. I see some people like posting on the ex-Brethren on Facebook page and saying that they miss the sense of community. But I have to say that I never experienced any feeling of community in there. Like I just didn't. I always felt, I felt far more alone in the Brethren than I've ever felt since leaving.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1491s)

Yeah, 100%. Yeah. And it's so interesting, like we all have such varied experiences because I was having a chat with one of my mates [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1499s) other day and he's gay and he was saying that like other than that he's gay and obviously he doesn't like, he's a non-believer. He said, I don't believe in anything that I was taught and obviously it's a very toxic environment. He said my family life and my family wasn't so bad. So he said for me, I've had worse experiences when I've left because I've had to deal with the fact that my family isn't like it was before. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1529s) said that's been the most difficult. And it's just a really interesting thing that to put into perspective, like we had, we weren't ever like, he just fit in. It was just other than, you know, obviously he had an actual judgment, I guess, for want of a better word, of the whole environment. He said my experiences there weren't as horrific as what others have had. So then also comes now with the battle of being like, well, it's almost just as difficult now [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1559s) you're set up to fail in the real world from coming from a Brethren. Like whether that's studying at university or further in your career, you're really ill-equipped to deal with the real world.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1571s)

Yeah, yeah. And I think a lot of people, of course, um, because there's such a focus on having like a family business and, you know, being able to provide for your children by employing them, I think like everyone, like a lot of people in there, their whole employment history has been family-based. So like, how do you go to actually getting a real job you have to fight for after that? Like, I don't know, it's difficult. I didn't experience that. My dad didn't have any kind of business. So I did actually have jobs where I was sort of like thrown into a strange environment that I didn't know, which I think stood me in good stead.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1610s)

Yeah, that is good.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1611s)

Yeah, hiring for a new job and new jobs, um, afterwards. I think I was possibly lucky in that way, but it didn't feel like it at the time.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1617s)

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1617s). On that point of jobs and that, like I've been talking to a young girl that's wanting to leave, she's in the Brethren and she's really battled with the idea of applying for a job and writing a resume. And likewise, a couple of cousins of mine that are left have a similar, you know, um, experience in the sense that girls are not really set up to leave or to write a resume or even know what that was. You're sort of taught like that, um, your job is just a stopgap until they find a nice husband here or [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1648s) find some guy to get married to, isn't it?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1651s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1652s)

Like, I come across journalists all the time that reach out to Brethren and ask for statements, so it'd be really interesting to hear your perspective as a female from who left recently. You know, they often say, oh no, women work, women don't have to have a choice in marriage. Women, like, what's your perspective? Like, do you believe marriages are arranged? Do you believe that you would have been able to have a career in there, like all the, all the fact that the reasons [you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1678s) left aside?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1680s)

Yeah, I think the answer is it varies. Like, I think that, um, a lot of people, um, who fit really well into the Brethren culture, they do manage to go out and find, you know, a guy who they maybe, they like and they want to get married to. But I mean, is it really a good idea to make a decision to get married to someone when you've only known them for, say, six weeks or something, or six months or whatever? Like, I don't really think that's a very safe [basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1708s) for a good marriage. And yet they get married at 22 or whatever, and they're expected to be with this person for the rest of their life, um, who they hardly know, um, with absolutely no preparation for a lot of parts of what marriage would involve. So I think that probably for me, I wouldn't have experienced anything like that because, again, we weren't very high profile. I think that, um, I probably would end up being a, you know, a spinster [woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1738s) who didn't ever get married. And they treat women who don't get married so badly. Like, it's terrible. You know what it's like. Like, they look down on them. They are literally the bottom of the pile. Um, yeah, absolutely zero respect and laughed at and mocked, and it's fearful. Um, and I think that there maybe are arranged marriages when it comes to like women in more sort of, you know, the bigger families who, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1769s) they speak to Bruce Hales, I think he sometimes is like, oh, well, maybe you should consider getting married to this guy. And like, he sort of like makes a strong hint, which is as good as telling people that they have to do it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1783s)

Exactly. And that was, I guess, kind of my point, like to lead up to to hear your perspective on that, because essentially if you have to seek approval for marriage, it's arranged because here, this is yes or no. Right?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1794s)

That's a point. Yeah, absolutely. And there's many people who we've all probably heard of that [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1799s) told no and had to go away and, you know, deal with, you know, having their heart broken, I guess, um, which is terrible. You shouldn't be able to just say no to people like that when it's a, yeah, normal kind of way to want to get married.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1813s)

Yeah, and I think that's where they, you know, I had a journalist ask me this question a couple days ago, and he asked me why I thought, um, sexual abuse, marital abuse, all those things were so high and prevalent in there. And I do, that is one, that's one piece of the pie, is that people don't get to like freely choose who they want to marry. They don't get this lengthy, they don't get to really know this person, right? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1844s) then they say, okay, it's just immediate, like let's get married. And then you're in this relationship and you don't realize how much this person drinks. You know, I mean, it's just this prime foundation for so many things to happen.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1858s)

For sure. Yeah, so much you can't know about a person, um, you know, in the tiny, short timeframes that they expect before marriage. Um, and then it's just stuck with them. Like, you know, there's no getting out of a marriage unless one of you dies or leaves.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1876s)

So yeah. Yeah. Well, there is hope though. I have heard of a divorce in the Brethren, and I know of others that want a divorce. So really? Just one down?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1887s)

It's just one case.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1889s)

Yeah, but you know, and all it takes is one, so girls, keep putting your foot down.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1899s)

Okay, okay. So I want to go to, you mentioned a letter that you wrote the, um, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. I am going to share this. Are you willing to read it out for the listeners and viewers?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=1910s)

Yeah, sure. Can we just like make an announcement to all Brethren that this was sent to all Brethren? So if you're a Brethren, this didn't reach you, but take note. In 2018, December, we left it. And, um, yeah, we knew that they wouldn't pass it on, but we wanted to send it anyway. Um, so yeah, we wrote this letter and it's for all of you, um, who are still in there. Um, so this is what we wrote.   
To the Brethren in Adelaide and Mount Barker and the World. This letter is to explain some of our reasons for leaving the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. This decision saddens us greatly, especially as we have many we respect and consider friends amongst the Brethren. In our estimation, this respect and friendship remains, although we may be cut off from you. It is not with the individual people of the Brethren community that we are in opposition. It is with:

* the community culture that responds to diversity with judgment rather than acceptance,  
    
* the disappointing lack of empathy, true compassion and kindness towards non-Brethren, especially those of non-Caucasian ethnicity, especially disappointing for a church that loudly claims to be a charitable organisation,  
    
* the practice of using fear rather than logic to inspire commitment, especially in regards to impressionable, innocent children and young people,  
    
* the restriction of free information to allow members to establish their own informed judgments, as in 'we'll do the thinking, you do the doing',  
    
* the lack of diversity in career choices open to community members and the lack of opportunity for women to rise to positions of leadership,  
    
* the patriarchal system around which the community is based, which although unofficial, favors those with higher social status, causing a hierarchy that disadvantages weaker members,  
    
* the puritanical spirit that discourages creativity, interest in arts and culture and higher education, thereby stunting personal growth,  
    
* the way a single imperfect human is elevated to godlike status above the rest of mankind, thus earning the exclusive brethren the perhaps deserved moniker of a cult.

We are not willing to continue to be part of a system that we do not consider ethical, emotionally healthy or kind. We seek to live our lives with integrity, kindness and truth, and we feel that the Brethren culture is not conducive to these aims. We deeply wish that this did not necessitate us losing contact with you all, but the estrangement will not be enforced by us, but by the strictures of the Brethren church. We need to live lives that are true to ourselves, our consciences and our beliefs, and we do not apologize for this. Our thoughts and prayers stay with you, especially those of you who have suffered due to the Brethren way of life. The Brethren students barred from following their dreams, the unpopular and poor Brethren who work their whole lives trying to gain respect, the Brethren woman who exists within a sexist system from childhood, the LGBTQ+ Brethren forced to hide their true selves. To all of you, we extend love, empathy, and the very best of our wishes in hopes that each of you will find your true north and follow it. Goodbye.  
And then we've signed it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2118s)

Oh my God. I mean, I can't even imagine that, yeah. That the people within there that received this letter, the men, that they would have received that, who probably haven't had an original thought in their lives, would have been confounded by the intelligence with which this was written. Like it's insane.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2141s)

Like I want to unpack this letter. I really want to because, and especially in the state that we're in right now within inside the PBCC, this letter is going to be so helpful, so helpful for people. So I want to go through these points one by one and just discuss them a little bit. So let's start with the very first one. The community culture that responds to diversity with judgment rather than acceptance. Now all three of us have experienced this. Everybody who's done a podcast [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2171s) experienced this. This is a huge issue in there that judgment is the first reflex. It is not open-minded, open arms, relaxed, open, you know what I mean? Like when someone comes to me with an issue, my immediate thing is how can I help this person? That's literally, that's just, it's ingrained in my soul. And it's just learning how to have boundaries. But like, how do we point [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2201s), how would you point out to somebody listening to this inside there of what this judgment looks like inside the PBCC?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2208s)

The thing is, it's all diversity, isn't it? It's not just gay people, it's not just, you know, it's everything. Anything that deviates even slightly from the mold of what a Brethren person is supposed to be is looked at judgmentally. You do your hair a different way, judgment. You, you know, your car is a bit different to what it should be, judgment. Um, you, I don't know, your clothes are a little bit outside what everyone else is wearing, judgment. Like [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2238s) just everything. Like there's no reason for that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2242s)

They all of these things are just neutral aspects of a person, including your sexuality. The reason they do focus so much on the judgment is in some way, it works itself in maintaining control. Because, well, you know, Bruce Hales or his close affiliates aren't going to be there in your house watching you grow up or monitoring the way your parents bring you up. So his teachings [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2268s) do the work itself in the sense that, well, my brother will, will, you know, out me if I have music I shouldn't have and so forth. Like it works for itself in maintaining the control on the wider masses.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2281s)

Yeah, yeah. I guess, and the penalties for being, you know, being considered wrong are so high that people are scared of doing anything at all that is not like everyone else, just in case it might be wrong.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2299s)

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2299s), like, yeah, yeah. A small way of, I remember an experience of that happening was at Bruce Hales's house. Um, I remember a brother went there from the UK and he was asking how long should the shorts be for the boys, the boys wearing shorts to school, like sports shorts. How long should they be? And I remember, you know, hearing the story of how Bruce was saying to Gareth or one of his boys, I can't remember [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2329s) it was, like, show them how short, how short. And they were mocking this poor, you know, earnest follower of the truth who was asking because, again, you're too terrified to make a decision that could bring in such judgment and conflict. So you, they're asking like, how high? And then literally he was being mocked and they were pulling his pants right up, trying to show how short and mocking him. Isn't it? And in that, I'm like, you can't mock somebody for this. This is your system. The way you've set [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2359s) up leaves people terrified to make or have an original thought of their own. So therefore, when they turn to you and ask, you mock them for it.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2367s)

Yeah, though he's so unkind. This is what strikes me about Bruce Hales. And I want to say this to people who are still in there. Have you ever looked at the way he treats people? Do you, does it not hit something wrong inside of you? He's so unkind to people. He doesn't respond to people in a kind way. If [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2389s) a good person, that's not how you treat people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2394s)

Is this especially if you're, if you're representing the actual embodiment of the spirit of Christ? Like, you know what I mean? Like that you should be this wholeheartedly compassionate, open-minded, arms wide open person that exudes that.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2411s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and then that's kind of unrealistic because we are human, so...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2418s)

Yeah. But I mean, you can still be human, compassionate and be, I mean, I've met many Christians that are, they're full, like wholeheartedly Christians who are very kind people.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2429s)

Yeah, like it's definitely, it is possible to be in a church and in a religion and be kind, compassionate. Yeah, I've met so many people since leaving. I don't personally believe anymore, but I've met so many Christian people who believe, you know, basic Christianity and they, you know, kind, good people. It doesn't have to be like this.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2452s)

You find that with any faith. Like, I have friends that are Muslim that have shown me a lot more love and acceptance than my own Christian parents, you know? And again, like other Christian groups that don't hold this judgment. It's [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2471s) a simple acceptance and love for all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2473s)

Their judgment is what creates the bullying, right? And the bullying is horrific. Like the stories or the conversations I hold with insiders, it just my heart gets just so attached because you just, you're like, no, like, why can't, let's just be kind. Why can't we just be kind humans, you know? It would be such an easy fix in there. Like people ask me, are you trying to get the church to fall down? No, I'm not. Just be [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2503s). Let's just be kind. Let's just be like, let's take care of our people. When you care for others, you don't allow the things to happen that are happening in there. It comes down to just caring.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2515s)

Absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2516s)

Yeah. And I mean, this takes us to this next, um, point here, the disappointing lack of empathy, true compassion and kindness towards non-Brethren. And so those are people that are outside of the PBCC, especially those of non-Caucasian ethnicity, [especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2533s) disappointing for a church that loudly claims to be a charitable organization.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2538s)

Yeah, I'll let you, I'll let you comment on that.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2540s)

I just, like, that's so racist, just straight-up racist. Like, you know, talking about people of Indian ethnicity, people of Aboriginal ethnicity, just anyone who's not white Caucasian, it's just like automatically judgment point two. So yeah, just the racism that keeps popping up and popping up and popping up with no basis really.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2570s)

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2570s) you know what's wrong? Like, yeah, obviously I can't speak on it. I'm white as they come, but I don't know, I don't know why they are like this. Like it's again, like, you know, responding to the diversity with judgment, even though your race is not something that anyone can control. Yeah, yeah. And it comes across as very hypocritical when in turn the Brethren are the first to squeal when a newspaper article writes or calls them a cult or talks about them being a [minority](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2601s). And I do think it comes from a lack of diversity. What you said is 100%. Like I think that, and also the lack of access to information. So if you aren't, you know, immersed in a culturally diverse environment like the Brethren aren't, you aren't surrounded by people that aren't of, you know, the same faith or religion or race, of course you have this inherent fear, which then is judgment and hatred of something you know nothing [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2631s).

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2632s)

Absolutely. Um, yeah, I mean, even their website, they will, they make it look like it's this racially diverse kind of...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2641s)

Yeah, they, they put like the tiny handful of families who aren't white and they get them to do the photo shoots for the website.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2649s)

Yeah. And it's just a, it's a misrepresentation completely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2653s)

And when they first did that website, do you remember it? Like, it was all the talk amongst us Brethren. Like I was in the cult at that point and remember being like, [oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2661s) yeah, they got the Demarages there or they got this family or that family that were not white Caucasian and stuck them in the photo to appear to be this culturally diverse mainstream Christian church.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2673s)

Yeah. I guarantee though when they lost their charitable status there in the UK, that that was probably one of the things that was brought up.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2681s)

I think it was, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2683s)

Yeah. Okay, third point. The practice of using fear rather than logic to inspire commitment, especially in regards to impressionable, innocent children and young people.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2694s)

So yeah, like I mentioned before, um, the way children just grow up afraid, um, and it's always just fear. It's like, it's never like, use your brain and your curiosity to think about something and to do your own research and come to the conclusion. It's always like, just believe, don't question, just believe. Um, or you will be a doubter, and doubters go to hell. Um, it's not the way to run things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2724s)

No, and I'm sure in school, so I'm just, I'm hearing in my head some of, some, I mean, we obviously get feedback and, you know, trolls that come along. Yes, I'm sure in school you have things that you research, things that you do. We're talking more about if you're questioning a teaching that's being put out or something that you're not allowed to do. So you, I'm pretty sure you would never be able to go up to someone and be like, you know what, why can't we be gay or why can't we do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2755s)? Why can't we do that? Right? Those are the things where, you know, if you had a mainstream Christian church, would allow you to talk about it at all.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2764s)

Exactly. You'd sit down, have good conversation. There would be no judgment. There would be no fear driven back into you of like, don't even ask that. You don't even go there. It's the great man did this, the great man said that. Like, this is just, this isn't, this isn't even discussable. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2785s) don't discuss this.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2786s)

Absolutely. Yeah. And there is, there really is, and in particular for the queer community, there is no safe landing pad or safe environment in which you can broach these questions. Because I'm sure, and I'm curious to know, Tam, is there like parts of you that you know, threw out little bits of questions here and there to gauge responses from whether that be family or friends about the queer community? Like to see, like as kids we do, because you do find out from a very young age [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2816s) you're gay. Yeah, yeah. So how was your experience?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2820s)

I don't know, I guess you just kind of build up this, um, little internal database of this tiny tidbit that this family member or that classmate said about the, you know, about gay people or about, yeah, yeah. And you just kind of build it up and you're like, okay, so this person said this and this person said this, and you have this like little, little database of information and it builds you [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2846s) picture. And it's not a good picture.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2849s)

No.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2850s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. And unfortunately, that's how most of the closeted, I mean, it's an interesting statistic, if you said one in ten people were gay, that's what, out of 50,000 members, that's 5,000 closeted members in there.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2866s)

I mean, probably more so. So many, yeah, probably more so because they are closeted. Um, I think that statistic would have obviously been taken on openly gay people.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2875s)

So it's just really interesting and also sad that [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2876s) you align with these stories, just know that over the hill, once you leave and put the worst of it behind you, things do get better and life, life is nothing that you could ever imagine. There's community out here.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2890s)

Exactly. People will just accept you for who you are without judging you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2899s)

Yeah, yeah. And I want to clear up, I just want to clear up some, um, comments that have come our way towards Get a Life that yes, there has been a lot of people come on here recently from the LGBTQ+ community, and it isn't that we're pushing an agenda. It's not at all that. What it is, is exactly if I am receiving requests and if I am talking to people who are closeted in there that are planning an escape, I am going to put content [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2929s) that helps them. And right now it's a lot of queer people in there from that community that are seeking help. And it just so happens that, you know, we have a good bunch of those that have left and it's just, we haven't had a lot of females. And so I did reach out to Tam specifically because I wanted another female to come on here because that's who I'm talking to, right? And I think it's important that the females that have been able to get out and build [an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2959s) incredible life for themselves to be able to show that yes, this is possible. This is very possible. And it wasn't the only reason why you left, right? Yes, that was one part of it, but there was a whole other part of it, like what we're going through right here, you know? So to those, to those comments that were pushing an agenda, I'm not. But I am very personally attached to those that are reaching out from inside.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2985s)

And on that point, we aren't, we all pushing an agenda? This is the agenda.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2989s)

Absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=2990s)

But it was, it was said to, it was said to me in a much more judgmental way of, of like, you know, yeah, there has been a lot of people from the LGBTQ+ community on here, but there's a purpose. It's, there's a reason why I'm doing that. So call it an agenda, call it whatever you like.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3010s)

When I left, there was, I don't know if any other gay women have left before me, but when I left, I didn't know of anyone. Like, I at least felt like I was the first, if I'm not, um, I apologize to whoever was before me, but like as far as I knew, I was the first one who'd ever experienced this. That's what it felt like.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3029s)

I never heard of a gay woman, you're right.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3031s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3037s)

It's important for us if we have this platform and it is really helping. I mean, it's just, for me personally, I lost someone very close to me from the LGBTQ+ community and so for me, I have this personal emotional heart that's always wanted to make sure that I never, ever hear of a story of somebody taking their life again because they were not accepted. That breaks my heart, literally breaks my [heart.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3067s) So if that's a personal agenda, then that's a personal agenda, but it's coming from a place of I don't want to lose anybody. I don't think anybody should have to suffer and end their life from being born the way that they were born, whether that's your color of your skin, whether that's your sexual orientation, whatever that is, nobody should be judged for it and nobody should ever have to feel that low because of the judgment from others.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3097s)

And quite frankly, it's nobody's business what two consenting adults do.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3101s)

Exactly. Let's turn our attention to the people that don't have, that shouldn't, that have things happen to them that shouldn't be happening to them, like children. And yeah, focus on that. Focus on the people that don't have voices. Yeah. Um, yeah. And the negative attention that comes around pushing an agenda or having, as one very toxic ex-leader [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3127s), a parade of homosexuals, I think he called it. Um, that comes from somebody who's never, ever escaped the cult, like never, ever. You know, and you find this, you know, it's very difficult to get some of, you know, I know from my own experience, to get some of the mentality of the, the way we, the unlearning of what we learned in there, right? And unfortunately, when you're that age and kicked out because you just weren't as good as the other cult leaders, essentially, you take those [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3158s) judgmental, narrow-minded, um, views and spew them forth, you know, like it doesn't change.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3166s)

We're just at a time in society, we're at a, I mean, it's 2024, I think that we have had so many years of being judgmental, hard, that it's time for us. It really is time for us to learn how to sit and have discussions. You don't have to agree with this. You don't have to even believe in it. But just look at every person with heart. Like just be compassionate, just be compassionate. Like [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3196s) me, that's, I don't care what you believe, what it is. But if you're going to come and talk to me, I guarantee I'm going to listen unless you're coming at me right over and over and over, then I'm gonna, you know, draw a boundary. But I do think that as humans in 2024, we need to be offering our hands. We need to be offering spaces and places for people to just be who they are, whatever that may be.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3221s)

Yeah. And also just on that note, for the ex-members that do come and listen to these podcasts and don't like what we have to say, or, you know, we've all had feedback. Um, have you ever thought that this is probably not for you? Like, yes, it's great to sit here and trauma bond and go over things and feel, um, feel validated because someone else went through a similar experience. But these podcasts, in my view, have always helped people that are in the cult. And then big picture, think big picture, they've also helped [journalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3251s) and other people grasp what they're dealing with in terms of members' experiences within there. It's not, it's not a dedicated, or from what I've seen of the podcast, it doesn't seem to come, it's not, it's not for ex-members. If you have a problem with it, well then don't worry, it wasn't for you anyway.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3268s)

Yeah, make your own podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3272s)

That's what I always say. I don't mean, I would welcome it, you know? There's, there's lots of people out here that can teach you how to do it. Okay, point number four. The restriction of free information to allow members to establish their own informed judgments. We'll do the thinking, you do the doing. And we have addressed this on so many podcasts. And just before I hand it over to you, Tam, I wanted just to revert back to a podcast we did with an anonymous teacher and she told the story of a student [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3303s) tried to access a mental health helpline and couldn't access it. And I have to say that that was probably the biggest thing that ever broke my heart was hearing that story because, and he got into trouble, he literally got into trouble for it. Like it's just, this is what I say to everybody inside there, anybody who's watching this, any journalist, that is absolutely insanity that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3334s) would not allow a helpline and give someone trouble for trying to access it when they're needing help.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3342s)

Unbelievable. Yeah, I mean, I worked at the Brethren school, um, and I can definitely see that happening.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3351s)

How was your time there when you worked there? What was it like?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3357s)

Um, it was way better than my previous job, that's for sure. No, I enjoyed working there, actually. Like it was, it was a lot of work.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3365s)

But do you see now as an outsider, what, like what are your, like, objectively, like what are your perspective of the schooling? And...

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3377s)

No, I guess I was just going to say that like, it breaks your heart because you get to know the children. And I mean, I know that there's people in there who are like us, who are part of our community. Um, obviously I'm not going to name names or give any indication, but there are people there, but you know, and like the kids know and the other children know they get bullied for this. Um, and what is their life going to be? It's, it's just hopeless, isn't it? Like, you know, they're going to live their whole lives in there and, and you know, I hope that they find their way out, but who's going to help them?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3411s)

You know, well, there's a plethora of people out here that are happy to help you. Um, I'm talking to a couple in there at the moment that are going through everything we're going through. And it's so good that you're able to come on here and share your experiences, Tam, because I know that they will in particular, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3429s), find your experiences very liberating because it's, we've only ever had gay men that have come forward, really, apart from Joey, I think. Um, so it's really, I think, refreshing and sort of promising, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3444s)

Back to this statement that we hear very often inside the, inside the PBCC, 'we'll do the thinking, you do the doing'. It really forms that mentality of sheep just following one person and everybody just patterns behind one another. And I mean, you do, you don't think outside their box.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3470s)

Yeah. And it's safe, isn't it? Like, you don't ever have to think about anything. You know, they're going to make all your decisions for you. You know what you wear, what you eat, what you talk about, what you're interested in. Um, yeah, it's, I guess, you know, that that particular quote really, you know, wormed into everyone's brains.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3492s)

And yeah, I think it's almost like a universal language, right? Like we've all heard that. Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3499s)

Never forgot that one. The next point is the lack of diversity and career choices open to community members and the lack of opportunity for women to rise to positions of leadership.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3511s)

Basically, with no higher education available, except for like very, very limited courses like accounting and so on, there's not very much available, is there? Like, there's all this talent amongst those kids who are coming out of high school. Um, you know, I've seen children who are phenomenally talented in art, music, um, you know, all sorts of areas, science, um, all different things, but they aren't able to [fulfill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3541s) that potential. They aren't able to go into any kind of career where their actual talents can be utilized. Instead, they just get put into admin, sales, accounting. Um, and it's just, you know, that's a whole massive generation of people for a 40,000 person cult who, you know, imagine the potential of those kids if they could actually get out and do what they were, you know, what they were born to do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3568s)

Yeah, yeah. And we've said that many times on this podcast, right? That, you know, the geniuses that are in there, the doctors or the, you know, people who could soar to solving, you know, societal and world problems, and they're stuck inside there behind a desk.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3586s)

Yeah. Even if your career isn't of academic, you know, learning, there is so much in just seeing, like, what somebody fairly close to me has done in terms of just a career of their own business and whatever else. Like she has made incredible moves, and all with coming from a very, very uneducated background in the sense that women were never allowed to pursue any particular, at her age, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3616s), any sort of course, and to see how successful she's been is just amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3621s)

Yeah, brilliant. It's wonderful. Yeah. The next point we have here is the patriarchal system around which the community is based, which although unofficial, favors those with higher social status, causing a hierarchy that disadvantages weaker members. This is a very, very, very, very important point here because like you were talking, Tam, at the beginning, that your family, you know, you're kind of on the lower of the totem pole. I grew up on the bottom of the totem pole, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3651s) it isn't really, there's no, it's not spoken about, but it's presented. It's where you sit in meeting, it's who gets to come to your house for breaks and for suppers and all these other things. It is very much created this hierarchical system that's in there.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3669s)

Yeah, and it's not even unspoken. It's just not official, um, but it's very, very real for all that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3679s)

It's very real. So real. Yeah.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3682s)

One thing that's really, like in the last month has sort of lightbulb’d for me is that you don't realize, yes, we all knew that there were different hierarchies within there and we kind of knew where we were placed and you were kind of always like, oh, thank goodness I'm not as low down as that family or thank goodness, you know, like you're all, everyone was pining to be, um, close to the royal family, I guess, or the contacts that the people that were in contact with them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3712s)

Um, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3712s) one thing that's really come home to me recently is how much it is a smoke and mirrors. Like, um, somebody was like, oh, like within the Brethren was telling me about something they discovered and I was like, oh my goodness, like I remember going through that period of where I had to deal with the Hales family and saw open computers, open phones, iPhones, and I was questioning it. They're like, oh, why would you buy from UBT? They're so [expensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3742s). And I remember that moment of being like, hang on, we're all here subscribing to bloody silver bullets and every piece of lifeline help thought, anything costs money, right? And they bleed you for every last cent. And I'm like, you are so flippant about something that is a huge contraband. And then that's when that smoke and mirrors disappears. And I just recently had somebody experience this where they had their whole, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3772s) I guess in a broader sense, we've seen this happen too, like in the sense that, um, seeing somebody so close to Bruce Hales being in his own family, you know, being kicked out for infidelity or whatever it was, unfaithfulness. Wow. You've got, you know, you've got that which really caused, I had a whole heap of people reach out saying there's a lot of unrest, like this person's been withdrawn from. And like, you've got things like that that happen that create a distinct light opening within the smoke and [mirrors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3802s). You suddenly get an insight into it and you're like, oh, hang on, they're not that different to us, except they're benefiting from it. Except they're higher up in the echelon of that world, um, and yeah, reaping the benefits from this. And I think my point here is that sometimes you just, you only see what's within your blinkers that they've put on you. There is a lot more that's happened or happening. And I guess we saw that happen with Aberdeen. Like, there was no questions to ask. There was no, and you've got literal witnesses. And when you have [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3833s) whole group of people saying the same thing, maybe, maybe there is smoke where there's fire. Like, maybe there is something there. So don't be so shut off from opening your mind as to a possible different scenario, a possible different life, because it is quite shocking. This person was so like broken by it because, and you know, they say don't meet your heroes. It's that kind of mentality of like discovering the truth of a reality that can be so [unsettling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3863s). Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3865s)

The next point is the puritanical spirit that discourages creativity, interest in arts and culture, and higher education, thereby stunting personal growth.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3877s)

Yeah, so I guess like, as we mentioned, just, I mean, they even say, don't have a hobby, which, what kind of group says that? Yeah, um, just anything that will stimulate people's brains, get them thinking outside the box, um, get them creating things, all of that is considered childish. It's okay to like, do art for a subject at school, but [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3908s) once you leave, that's, that's not really what adults do, you know? Um, yeah, there's just such a, no value placed on it, on being a person with a creative mind or a person who can make beautiful art or, you know, write beautiful stories or anything like that. It's just there's absolutely no value placed on it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3930s)

And you should be able to be as a female, after you're done school, go and look at uni, all the things that they offer, and check off what you want and go and do it. Follow that passion. Whatever that passion is, it doesn't matter. You should have that opportunity available to you. And the uni courses they talk about that they take, so they present this to the public as like, oh we do, no, you do a little course here, you do a little, that's [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3960s) what I'm talking about. I'm talking about going and getting a degree in something, going and pursuing whatever you want to do. You can go and get a Master's in art, like you, there's so many things that you can do that feed your passion and creativity, and you should have that accessible to you. It shouldn't be cut off from you.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3979s)

And you might do really well at it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3982s)

I'm sure you will.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3984s)

Yeah, surprise yourself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=3987s)

And the last point is, the way a single imperfect human is elevated to godlike status above the rest of mankind, thus earning the exclusive brethren, the perhaps deserved moniker of a cult. And I just want to just pause here for a second and just let all those insiders know that there are many, many cults out here that all promise the same thing. They all promise the same thing. It does not mean you guys [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4017s) any more special than the other ones. They all promise the same thing. So because you're in this tight-knit group and you are fed, which was done, said just recently again, is that, you know, why, why is there only 55,000 of us, or why is there only 50... Well, it's because we're special. No, no, there's many groups that think this. There's many groups that think this. So it's not [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4048s) you guys that are giving out what you're giving out. There's many cults like this.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4053s)

Even the jargon is not dissimilar to others. That we've had the documentary on the 7M TikTok cult and they called him a man of God. Yeah, and he promised unachievable things. Like it's every single, every single one. Do your own research. Don't be afraid to do your own research.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4071s)

I mean, obviously you're not going to be able to sit down and watch a Netflix series, but I mean, for anybody who has not watched Dancing with the Devil on Netflix, watch Dancing with the Devil on Netflix. Absolutely incredible. So inspiring.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4084s)

Yeah, so inspiring. As it was, a very, very good series. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna pull up some pictures that you sent us. Okay, walk us through these pictures that we have here.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4103s)

Yeah, so I guess I like to save everything that I can because I guess for a long time I knew that, you know, we might leave and we might not have access to any of this before. So, yeah, I've saved as many family photos as I could. This one is obviously one of the ones that was used in one of the photo books. That's obviously me on the left and my brother Matt in the middle and my brother Dave. I have their permission to show the photo. Um, I have, um, blurred my parents' faces, um, because I'm sure that they wouldn't want them shown here. And, um, yeah, so this was just the obligatory scarf photo.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4146s)

And this is this headscarf that you're wearing. So this is what they wear inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4153s)

This was very shortly before we left. So, yeah, it's like, yeah, that's one determined face. Those were the last times.

This is a school photo. We had the same uniform. I mean, obviously, but...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4173s)

That's triggering to see.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4175s)

I know. I felt, I was looking at all these photos and afterwards, you just kind of feel like weird and shaky inside. Just going back past it all.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4184s)

They're always very small classes too, which makes you feel a lot more exposed. There's no sort of melting into the background when you've only got eight kids in your class.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4191s)

Wow. Okay, so this was one class?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4193s)

Yeah, this is one class.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4195s)

Wow.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4196s)

I so hear you there. Like it's, that's such a good point. I forgot about how like exposed you felt constantly. Like somebody was about to say, oh my goodness, Ben Woodbury is gay. I mean, they did anyway.

Yeah, this one is, um, important. This is obviously a sports, um, thing that we did. So we did a gymnastics competition. This was one of the very first times I ever got to wear pants rather than just a skirt, skirt, skirt all the time. And I think it's really important. Um, it was a wonderful moment for me. I was like, I just remember feeling so confident and, you know, um, just comfortable in my body in a way that I never felt otherwise because they make girls do sports in these little [swingy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4243s) skirts and everything, which, you know, you flip around and the skirt flips up and you just don't feel comfortable, um, doing any of that, exposed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4254s)

Yeah, and could you imagine doing sports in pants with a skirt over top? I remember doing a paper route and this is how I would dress if it was really cold.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4262s)

Gymnastics too. Like, I mean, the skirt would always fall down and it would knock off like the, I don't know, the high jump bar or the, you know, the bar that you were trying to flip over. Like straight up disadvantage.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4274s)

That's insane. Again, crippling you for just normal activities, right?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4278s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Sort of a metaphor really for the way that women are treated in general. Yeah. Um, yeah, this is just a baby photo for me in a tiny little scarf, and that's my brother Matt. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4293s), that's so cute, my cheeks. Scarf on again. Yeah.

Another, um, photo book photo. Yeah, me, Dave, Matt.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4307s)

Looks like you're a little bit older in this one.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4310s)

Yes, this is the one, um, I think it was just the year that we left, I believe, if I'm right. Um, so it was very shortly before we left.

And I think that was the year before that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4323s)

Yeah, I don't have them in order.

Yeah, uh, what an incredible story that you got to leave with your brothers though. Like, that's so heartwarming and rare.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4339s)

Yeah, and so lucky.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4342s)

Yeah, yeah. If there was something that you could say to the insiders, what would you say?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4349s)

Okay, so I did want to speak directly to any current members of the Brethren and anyone who is, um, watching this right now or listening to it. Um, especially anyone who's part of the LGBTQ+ community, but just to anyone really, like anyone who is thinking they might want to leave. So this is what I want to say to you. The little voice inside your head, the one that tells you that you're evil or sinning or wrong, that voice is a liar. It [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4379s) not your conscience. It's not the voice of God. And it's not innate to you, that little voice. The Brethren cult has put these words and that self-hatred into your head, and it's not the truth. There's actually a quote in your own Bible. I had to look this up so that you can also look it up and verify it. It's in John chapter 8 and verse 32, and it says, 'you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.' And I think, I believe that. I think that [quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4409s) is true no matter what your religion or your belief system is. Um, that is true. Um, you have the right to search for the truth. Anywhere you want to. Don't trust anyone who tries to block your access to information or tries to stop you from searching for the truth or shut down your thinking or shut down your curiosity. Don't trust those people because you have a right to search for that truth if you want to.

So please, I'm just saying to you, please keep searching, keep looking, keep pulling at the little loose threads, um, that we all know are there. Keep searching until you find that truth. And I hope that it sets you free, as per the quote. Um, that's all I wanted to say to you, um, except good luck.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4454s)

Wow, that's amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4456s)

Oh, I try not to cry. That's so, so beautifully said. Like...

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4466s)

And it's so simple, like it's so, it just makes sense. It really does.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4472s)

And I think as humans in general, we're trying to overcomplicate things. Um, it doesn't have to be that complicated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4479s)

Absolutely. And I do, I truly, truly believe that if you, like even if you take five minutes to yourself every single day, five minutes of quiet time, and I know it's hard to find it in there, but just listen to your gut. Listen to that little voice inside you and ask yourself questions. What are you questioning? Where are you looking? Like, make sure you give yourself honest answers. Allow yourself to listen honestly. [When](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4509s) you're in a meeting, when you have questions you want to ask people and you're fearful of that, that shouldn't be there. Your parents should be an open place. These priests should be an open place for you to honestly bring forth any questions that you have, and they should be answered with compassion.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4529s)

Yeah, invite those conversations. And if you end up out here, there's a community out here to pick you up. For sure.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4537s)

Can you give us an insight into how your life is now, specifically for those people that are closeted in there? What's your life like now?

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4550s)

Um, my life is just, it's good. Um, I'm in a really happy place. I have a beautiful partner, um, female partner, obviously. Um, and, um, I have my amazing brothers who are still by my side and still with me. Um, I have a wonderful community of friends around me. Um, I work at a workplace where I am able to be out to my colleagues, like they all know about my female partner.

I'm just in a really good place and it's possible, like you can get here. And yeah, I guess I found a new purpose. And my purpose is I like to volunteer, give back to the community. I'm part of a couple of different community groups. I donate blood, like that's a big thing for me. Like I like to do it quite regularly when I can. And I've also found community through that. So through volunteering, you will meet other good, you know, people, kind people who want to also give back to the community, who will like wrap around you and look after you when you need it. And yes, I just, I guess I just wanted to, um, [express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4630s) that there is, there's so much hope. You can have such a beautiful life. I could never imagine that my life would be this good when I was back in the Brethren. I just couldn't imagine it. Um, and yeah, it's wonderful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4641s)

Wow. And volunteering that you want to do, that you're not coerced or pressured into doing, right? That is a beautiful thing when there's something that you're passionate about, and then you find these communities and groups that you get to go and help volunteer and help out, right? It's just, it's not like the RRT when you're pressured into doing that. Yeah, this is something that you get to choose to do.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4665s)

Absolutely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4666s)

And you know, it's not just like the RRT, it's very obviously just set up so that they can get the charitable status and so on. Like, yeah. Whereas you've come out here and there's groups where people are literally just running on passion and love.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4681s)

And shivering, but, um, I'm part of my local Pride group in my area. We're completely volunteer-run. We don't really get funding or anything like that. Um, it's just a group of people like us who, um, work together. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4695s) run a pride march, um, and yeah, but that's my friend group. Like, um, and everyone is so close and I don't know, you just meet wonderful people. Um, yeah. And I think when you're in the Brethren, you believe, you internalize this idea that everyone outside is going to be cruel and evil and bad and out to get you and try and take advantage of you. But nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, there are bad people out here, but that's true of anywhere.

More often than not, you'll find that people are kind and good and they want to help and they want to help in what ways they can. And they'll be there for you. Um, you just have to sort of take that step and reach out your hand and, you know, be a friend to other people and they'll be a friend to you too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4742s)

The care is different, right? Like that's, I think that's where I was, I finally allowed my heart to really grow out. It was, I mean, I am, I'm a very emotional, caring person and it's so beautiful when you find people who are passionate about what you do and then you get to just, it's just this, I can't, it's just the love just comes up and out. It overflows your bucket and it's just, it feeds your life. There is so much love out here.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4771s)

I think you find it's genuine.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4772s)

So...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4773s)

Genuine, yeah.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4774s)

That's, that's the most, I think, almost, um...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4778s)

It's nothing for us in it.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4780s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4781s)

Yeah, yeah. The freedom, and I know this is a cliche statement, but the freedom you feel is just, ah, it's just so beautiful. It's like your whole body relaxes, it opens up, and then you've got this, I mean, yes, it is difficult navigating at first. You've got to learn how to make decisions. I think I drove my husband nuts because it was, I just, as a female, it was very hard for me to make decisions.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4807s)

Well, you're paralyzed with choice, right? Because you had no choice before. And everybody that I speak to has the same thing. It's like this paralysis that comes with choice. It's very real. You all of a sudden, you don't have like a Sunday planned for you. All of a sudden you've got to make decisions what you do on a Sunday. So you end up, it's like when you're choosing a movie on Netflix or something, you have so much choice, you end up spending two hours looking for the movie. That's the same with Sunday. We would sit there deciding for breakfast all day.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4834s)

Yeah, yeah. And like, it's not like how they teach you in there where they tell you that they, you know, they're gonna chew you up and spit you out, right? It's not like that. Like you guys, it's so, yes, it comes with its challenges, but those challenges are so worth your personal choice, your personal freedom, the ability to breathe in the air that has no restriction on it, right? That is, that's the beautiful part. If you want to [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4864s) a land with a million animals on it, you can go do that. You can be the crazy cat lady. You can be, you can foster as many animals as you want. And that's like, that's what I love. Animals. But you know, like it's there's just, you get to learn about who you are. I'm going to be 50 this year and I'm still learning who I am. I'm still like, you get to this continuous evolution of who am I, right? It's so beautiful.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4893s)

Yeah. And I think, I think it's really important, like you said, you learn who you are. I think that's the most important thing that I really struggled with. Like some of the people that are leaving currently, I'm like, do not trauma bond with other members. Yes, it's great to get information and feedback and how, you know, points of help, but you need to go on a little bit, exploration, journey of yourself first. And like I said, it didn't take, like it took me seven years to speak up about the Brethren. So yeah, if you want to do a podcast or whatever, yeah, that can all come, but go and figure out who you are [first,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4924s) because the person I was seven years ago or five years ago even is a very different person to the person I am today because you are constantly evolving. 

And yes, you can, the reality is there are evil people out here, but the difference is you won't get a Break list on Friday night telling you you have to have dinner on Sunday. The difference is you get to pick who you want to have in your life and you get to set those boundaries. And more importantly, you get to have the people that you care about that [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4954s) you, that show you love in your life. And I just think it's really important to know that because you can't, it's a false perception of reality to think that it's all like glittery and gold because it's not. It's just, that's the way life is. And I think if you have that expectation that reality is like that, not perfect, the real world, then you won't have this whole, I'm almost tempted to go back, I miss my, you know, I miss what was. 

And I think one of the biggest things is, um, we're [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=4985s) often, we have peace, right? No chaos out here in terms of compared to what we had, the turmoil we had. And my therapist always used to say to me, I'd say to him, I feel so uncomfortable, I don't know why. It's riling me up. And he's like, is it because you've got peace and you don't know what to do with it? And I'm like, okay, hit me harder. Like that hurt. Yes, it is. It's because you're so used to chaos. There's a safety that comes with familiarity. And often you find that with our relationships, you might have only ever been [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5015s) an abusive relationship. Your parents were in an abusive relationship. Sometimes you go for that type of relationship because it's safe, it's familiar. And I think sometimes we've got to, we've got to realize that. And what my therapist has helped me to understand is that this peace that I have in my life, this non-chaos, don't mistake it for like boredom or lack of something. It's just something you're not familiar with. So sit in it.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5042s)

Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I relate [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5045s) that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5046s)

And you're kept so busy in there, right? Like you're kept so busy. So for me, it's busyness, is that I am constantly keeping myself busy, but that's what I was trained to do. Right? And so it's super important for you to learn, learn how to relax. Learn how to just, yeah, exactly. Ben says, sit in some peace because it is very uncomfortable, especially for us females. It's so uncomfortable because you're just not, you're trained to just go, go, go, go, go. And if you don't sit, you clean.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5076s)

I used to feel so uncomfortable even just at a cafe or restaurant because it was another person bringing me food and I just sat and I wasn't supposed to go and help anyone. It just felt so wrong and weird because I don't know.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5090s)

Yeah, that makes sense. I get that. Like even when you have guests over and I don't know, it's just the same. I mean, I'm not like that now. I used to, when I first left, I was like such an entertainer. Like I'd have guests and throw parties and do this. And now I'm like, nah, I don't want anyone in my house.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5108s)

Yeah, or that everything's got to be impeccably clean before someone comes over.

### [**Tam Bennett**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5114s)

I still struggle with that a lot.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5115s)

I do too. 30 years later, it's still ingrained in me. I mean, I try little, I have little tricks that I do of like, uh, you know, one room that I keep messy just to prove a point that, okay, Cheryl, you don't have to have everything...

I think we all have that room. It's called the junk room.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5135s)

Oh, Tam, it was so, so, so beautiful to have you on here. And I know this will reach a lot of those inside because it's who's reaching out right now. Um, it's, it's so good. It's so good for the females from the LGBTQ+ community to come forward and just share their story of how they got to where they are, how they came out, how their life is now so that we can show them that this is possible, because you can't undo who you were born as, born [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5165s). You can't undo what you were born like. It's the same thing that, you know, you can't undo the color of your skin. It's the exact same thing.

Before we end this, I just want to comment on a statement that Tam made earlier about a study that was done that showed one in ten people are from the LGBTQ+ community. So if this study states that one in ten people are from the LGBTQ+ community, we could assume that in the PBCC there are over 5,000 closeted members with no assistance or helping them understanding who they are. And we just want to let you know that there is a life waiting [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5206s) you where you can truly be you. You just shared beautifully with how successful and peaceful someone can leave and stay a lesbian, get a partner, and have a very successful and beautiful life. So thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Ben, for joining us again. We always appreciate your insight and wisdom. And I'm going to end this podcast with another song from another ex-member. His name is Dawson. I'll put a link to his channel below. And yeah, so enjoy this song. [Much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5241s) love to everyone. Take care and we'll see you next time.

### [**Dawson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5247s)

Those walls you built, I just tore them down. The rules you made, I just broke them all. The role I played was your fantasy of a Christian boy, tragic reality. I always knew where you wanted me headed, with a girl, happily wedded. The role which you laid out before me crumbled into historical debris. Don't tell me heaven's what I am running from. I broke a spell, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5277s) who I'm running from. Don't tell me that I'll end up in hell. God told me I'll find love when I love myself.

Stop wasting that love on people who abuse me. I love myself the way I always needed but never received it. Bright with colors, the same for each other. Gender regardless of what I love. So love myself. This world we're in was built for rainbow lovers. That's what you built, that broken out. Wrote of that guilt that dragged me down. You can give me love, don't matter now. Cause I'm above, flying like a dove. Cause I never needed your opinion on my life if you won't stay in it. And I never needed your religion. Broke me once, won't break me twice. Boys like me, don't give up [dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaKWDyY35M&t=5339s). Girls are too, keep on believing. Cause people like us, we deserve to live in a world where we're all free to love myself.

Stop wasting that love on people who abuse me. Love myself, the way I always needed but never received it. Bright with colors, the same for each other. Gender regardless, the whole world I would just love myself. This world we're in was built for rainbow lovers. Ooh, ooh, ooh, for rainbow lovers. Oh, oh, oh, for rainbow lovers. Oh, oh, oh, for rainbow lovers. Ooh, ooh, ooh, for rainbow lovers.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
