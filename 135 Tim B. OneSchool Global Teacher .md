## Summary

OneSchool Global currently has almost 100 unfilled vacancies for teachers – and that number just keeps going up. Why is it so difficult for this extremely well funded school to retain staff? And why are so many teachers and principals simply disappearing mid-term?
Thanks to the courage of Tim, a OneSchool Global teacher who has just left after 2 years at an Australian OSG campus, we now have some answers!
In this raw, unscripted  podcast, Tim explains why year 11 and 12 students may never be in the same room as their teachers. How a school’s precious library of community approved books was trashed, and how ‘special needs’ students are denied the help they require by OSG’s militant global “one size fits all” policies.
We hear how teachers face impossible dilemmas as they have to choose between doing the right thing for their students and keeping their jobs. We learn of the unethical rules imposed on teachers that are only conveyed verbally, never in writing, and the way the cult censors the teachers’ own personal social media accounts to conform with its “ethos”.
We hear about the profound lack of any meaningful choice for the students – not only are they denied university education, but they don’t even get a choice of career – they are simply allocated to various PBCC owned businesses – leaving then with no incentive to achieve or to excel.
Despite  shiny new campus facilities, all undergoing the “Campus Modernization" (money-laundering) Program and adequate wages, OneSchool Global rapidly becomes a death trap for its teachers' mental and moral health. Tim delivers a stark message to any teachers who may be tempted to take up any of those 100 OSG vacancies.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGyodryYhHRg%26t%3D0s)

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3s)

At the start, like literally when I started, there was a new contract brought in for the teachers. It was given to the teachers on the last day of the previous term before the six-week break, and it was like, "Here's your new contract, you have to sign it before you start back next year."

When I came in, there was all this discussion around all these things that had been put in this new contract, and one of them was around social media and teachers' use of social media. It was, "Yeah, you can't put anything on your personal Facebook that would contradict the values of the Brethren [community."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=34s)

It's dangerous for the kids who are in there, their lack of resources and the lack of support that they could get from anywhere for mental health and well-being sort of support. I tried myself, I tried because there was a student view you could go into as a teacher, so teachers were able to access a little bit more than students were through Streamline. But I  could go into Student View.

And I went into that and I actually tried myself to access Beyond Blue, Headspace, Kids Helpline, and they're all blocked. And also the other reason that I was given again by this [head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=68s) of Australian learning support was well-being and mental health. The community deals with that side of things, not the school.

And it was told black and white. I think the words were, "The community sees that as their kids in their community and they'll handle it the way they want to," and the teachers aren't to address it, basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=112s)

Hello, everyone, and welcome back to a very important episode of the Get-A-Life podcast. I'm Cheryl Hope, and joining me today are Richard Marsh and Ben Woodbury. All three of us are former members of the Exclusive Brethren, now known today as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

Today, we have a groundbreaking first, our very first OneSchool Global teacher who is speaking out without anonymity. Welcome, Tim. Tim worked at OSG, OneSchool Global, for two [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=142s) before recently resigning, and he's taken a courageous step by joining us today to expose what he witnessed inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church's private school system.

We have waited over two years for this moment, for a teacher to fully step forward and shed light on this toxic system they call a school. Tim, thank you for your bravery. By speaking out today, you're about to make a difference for hundreds of children across the globe. I have so many questions I honestly don't even know where to [start,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=173s) but let's begin with the beginning. How did you come to teach at OneSchool Global and what campus were you working at?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=181s)

Yes, I was at Maitland. Thanks for having me, by the way. It's great to be able to have this opportunity to speak up.

At Maitland campus in New South Wales in Australia, I took on a job as a learning support officer, so a teacher's aide. I have a background in teaching, so I took that opportunity when it was sort of presented to me by somebody who I knew who worked there already. And yeah, it was sold to me as, "Yeah, it's a great school to work in, really nice kids," which is true. The kids were always very nice. But yeah, I didn't realize all of the undercurrents [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=218s) stuff that went along with that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=219s)

So when you were first applying for this job, did they explain to you the background of the community in there?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=229s)

Yes and no. So they said that it served the Plymouth Brethren community, basically, that the school was set up for those students in particular. They explained that it was, I guess, just a Christian, a religious school. They have their own values and ethos that they run under, so that's their, yeah, what underpins the school is their values.

But that's about as far as they went into that side of it. It wasn't fully [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=259s) in terms of the values were given to us as, yeah, pretty standard. So yeah, they didn't go into the full details. They just basically said it's a, yeah, it's a religious school that runs on these religious values, but they didn't go into how deep that was and how much that actually controlled the school.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=281s)

So on the OneSchool Global website, this is what it says about their values and ethos:

"At OneSchool, each student, parent, and staff member shall uphold the values of the school, which include integrity, uprightness, honesty, and decorous conduct governed by the Holy Bible.

Care and compassion, kindness, consideration, and generosity to all. Respect for all people, property, opinions, and authority.

Responsibility for our actions, progress, and the environment. And commitment to self-discipline and the pursuit of excellence. 

At OneSchool, we are committed to a culture where students are encouraged to develop their full potential and acquire the discipline of learning how to learn while upholding Christian teachings and beliefs. 

The truth and authority of the Holy Bible and strong family values underpin the commitment of the school to provide quality at every facet of education, curriculum, teachers, [facilities,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=341s) management and discipline in a safe and caring environment."

I'm curious, Tim, on your experience and if it matches what their values and ethos is.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=351s)

That's right. They all sound like good things, don't they? Like, yeah, honesty, integrity, kindness, and compassion. That all sounds like pretty standard good values to have. It's the way that they're applied, I guess, is the problem, or their interpretation of them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=369s)

And how did you see that play out?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=372s)

Yeah, so basically I ended up quitting because I felt that I had to in terms of integrity. Like, I felt that there was no integrity from the teachers at the top or from the people who were in charge of the school. And that was basically, I said at one point, "I'll die on the hill of, I'm not going to sit by and let these sort of things happen either." And that was actually put to me by somebody I had a meeting with who was the head of learning support for Australia. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=402s) she said in those words, pretty much, "You'll have to decide if this is the right place for you to work, if you're able to do it our way or not," basically.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=411s)

You know, that's the head of learning support. That's terrifying that from outside of the community.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=416s)

Yeah, she's a teacher, but she's the head of, so they call, I think the position is the regional head of learning support, so the Australian leader for learning support. And yeah, was she fairly new? No, she's been there a long time.

Okay, yeah, so that's what I'm seeing with what I was seeing with all the people who are in higher positions was that they were all just completely in lockstep with what was asked of them from the community side of the schooling. So the board members and whoever was running the school from the top, the teachers who were in higher positions are in lockstep with them, basically.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=454s)

Just on that note, somebody who's outside that doesn't know the Brethren community or like Tim, is that the people that you're talking about, are they Brethren members or are they teachers? Because they're within that, within the schools that don't go to the church but comply with the ethos of the church.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=473s)

Yeah, so the teachers, the teacher side of it, so the people who are in the schooling, like so like the head of learning support, the head of curriculum, non-Brethren people who are teachers. And then I guess there's the other, the board side of it, who is the Brethren people who are pulling the shots as well.

It just seems, yeah, a lot of the teachers are just trying to please the board side of it. So sort of there's a dual [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=504s) structure, I guess. Like there's the Brethren.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=507s)

Is it out of fear, do you think, or money, or like is it well paid or is it because they have the same morals, like they have the same values as Brethren?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=516s)

I think a lot of it would be depending on the individual, I guess. But yeah, I think it's probably those higher-up people are probably those sort of business-minded personalities or career-minded personalities to a degree where they go, "Okay, well, I'm in this high position. I'm getting paid this high amount of money. I'm going to do what's asked of me of this position." I think that's basically once they get higher up, they realize, "Oh, well, this is how they want it done. I'm going to do what they tell me to do."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=547s)

So essentially, it is money. Because I do just have a lot of feedback from teachers that do contact me that have worked there that it's not really a career move. Like it's not something that furthers their career as a teacher. I know somebody that worked there for four years, I think it was, and they really struggled with assimilating into normal schooling because of how sort of pared back and stripped away the curriculum is.

Essentially, you know, they went into OneSchool with great credentials and came out with missing, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=577s) know, four years missing in their career essentially.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=582s)

So it would come down to you, do you think? I think so, yeah. I think a lot of it would in those much higher positions, but then there was also positions that have just been staffed. So they've recently gone from having a head of each subject in each state, they're doing this big alignment across Australia for all of the schools so they're trying to get all of the schools on the same courses basically and having the same structure for all across each state.

And they've gone to a single head of each subject for Australia as opposed to each state, and some of those positions were not a great increase in pay from what the teachers were originally getting. So I don't know whether it's just clout.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=627s)

Yeah, and that alone would be such gymnastics, wouldn't it? Because each state has different curriculums and course requirements.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=634s)

Oh, I've got no idea how they expect it to work. Yeah, each state has a different educational oversight body. So, yeah, good luck to those people.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=646s)

Yeah, my point pointing out there, the money thing was that, like, if you are a teacher and they're listening to this, like, what do you value? You've got children's education in your care you've been entrusted with. And I know that realistically we all work for money, right? But you have a special duty of care and as a former student, you're there to look after the kids, to see an education for children that leads to [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=676s) career for a child, and you know that that's non-existent.

So my point in that was highlighting the fact that these people, educators, that are prioritizing money rather than a child's education. I think that's so horrific.

For me, it calls to question their qualification to educate. Yes, they might be qualified, but you have to have a child's, I don't know, it has so many red flags for me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=707s)

Their complete and utter well-being. Yeah.

I want to go back to when you first started. So when you first started this, was there anything that seemed off? What was your first impression of it all?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=721s)

Yeah, it all seemed like, obviously, there's a lot of money in the school. So all like best technology, great facilities, all that sort of thing. So that was one impression was like, "Oh, wow, this is like really well set out, really well funded."

And then, yeah, all the kids, as I said, the kids were always all great. They're all very polite, respectful to the teachers, that sort of thing. They were all really nice in my campus.

And the families were all nice, but also sort of shy, I guess. Like you would say hi to somebody and they just sort of say hi and keep walking. And I was like, "Oh, okay, I guess that's that sort of separation thing happening." Like there was never any, not communication, but yeah, you could sort of sense there was a bit of difference between, yeah, the teachers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=776s)

Hesitation. Yeah.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=777s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

And then it's just the whole vibe of the school was like this, just this underlying secrecy about what we could and couldn't say. So like it was always watching what you were saying to the students. There's always these unsaid things of like, whether it's, yeah, basically anything outside of the school wasn't to be talked about and we picked up on that pretty quick.

It was like, "Oh no, you can't talk about certain books, you can't talk about certain TV [shows,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=810s) websites, all these different things that you're not able to speak to the kids about, not talk to the kids about university or further education or pets or your own family life." Basically, you're just there to talk about what's happening on the ground at school.

And that was, yeah, that was a, that was a big sort of mindset change for me, being like, "Oh, okay, so I can't talk about these things that could be relevant because the kids aren't allowed to know about it or they're not meant to talk about these [things."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=840s) That was, yeah, that was the sort of the most different, sort of weirdest feeling I got when I went in there was like, there's this big unsaid element of when you're talking to the kids as, yeah, this secrecy around certain things which are just normal society for a lot of people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=860s)

You said something very important there about university. So this has been in the papers recently where they're, they're coming out saying that that doesn't happen, that they are allowed to do university, they're allowed to do these tertiary studies, they're allowed to do all this post-secondary. I want your experience with that. Like when, what were you guys taught about their post-secondary? Was it ever talked about? Was it said like, "No, we don't do post-secondary"? What was, what was your experience with that?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=890s)

Yeah, yeah, it was pretty much known. I was open, yeah, that was what was happening. It was basically the teachers knew that the kids don't go to university and it was said like that, like, "These kids won't go to university after here." The principal was saying, "We need to find a way to motivate the kids to keep doing their studies, basically, because they won't go to uni."

And yeah, and their whole, once [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=920s) get to year 11 and 12, there's a structure for like post-school employment where they have, I can't think what it's called off the top of my head, but they've got a like a program that runs through the school now which is getting the kids ready for work in their businesses.

And there was also the, towards the end of the year, it was a certain time towards the end of the year where the kids all found out what their jobs were going to be. So they all got job offers from different community businesses. There was no, absolutely no, like career consultation, career offices or anything like that where you'd sit with the kids and be like, "Oh, what would you like to aim towards?" or "What would your, or what would you like your career to be?"

No guidance in that sense at all. It was just, "We sort of know where you're going to go."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=965s)

Well, it's no surprise that nothing has changed. As a former student, it was the same for me as well. And you kind of didn't, you lost faith in year 11 and 12\. You kind of didn't, you were always like, "What's the purpose of this?" And I know of other students that are a lot more academic than I could ever pretend to be, and they want to do university and have really struggled now leaving the Brethren getting into university because they didn't have enough under their [belt,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=995s) so to speak, or they've had to wait till later on in life to get in. They really do cripple you for the, for the real world, and especially in terms of other studies at university.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1006s)

Yeah, definitely. It's, it's definitely set up as a, yeah, it's the machinery of it to work from school straight into Brethren business work. And like, yeah, as you said, there's kids who are losing faith in doing the work and thinking, "What's the point?" And I was seeing that from kids who are in year eight and nine. It's like 14, 15-year-olds, they were just sitting there going, "Why, why would I bother?"

Like, girls in particular, they'll sit there and they'll go, "Why would I bother doing this? I'm just going to [work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1036s) in dad's business in admin." Like, yeah, they come to realize that and you can see when they get to that age where they're like, "What's the point? Why, why do I want to learn science or geography or history or English when I'm just going to go into dad's business and do admin?" 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1055s)

I mean, it's a standard thing,iIsn't it? "What do you want to do when you grow up?" "I want to be an astronaut." "I want to be a pilot." Doesn't apply, does it? I mean, that's a fundamental piece of childhood that's gone for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1066s)

Yeah, it makes me so angry because we just had articles, oh, we just had articles out where they're denying all this. And I just want to remind the listeners and viewers that Tim just left OneSchool Global. So he, it's not like he was a teacher 10 years ago. This man just left OneSchool Global.

So to Lloyd Grimshaw, to all those PBCC spokespersons, you're full of bullshit. Like, I call bullshit on [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1097s) that you, every time you reply about OneSchool Global, I just, I'm trying so hard not to cry right now because to me, it is all about the children. It is, I was with children for 12 years. This was my business, as I looked after children, and it's just, it's such an overlooked part of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

And then when we start digging at this black hole inside their community and inside their cult, they [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1127s) out with all of these other phrases that are denying exactly what you're saying here, Tim. So to hear it straight from your mouth, not anonymous, sitting right in front of us in black and white and giving us exactly what we hear from some of these kids inside.

I have lots of teenagers that talk to inside there. All of them, that is their main complaint is, "I want to go do this, I want to go and study this, and I can't do it inside here." So, "Cheryl, can you help me start? Like, what do I, what do I need to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1157s) so I can leave?" Yeah, it's just so disheartening when they feed the journalists and the news outlets with the absolute crap that they, they feed it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1170s)

Yeah, I mean, it's to be expected. It's almost contemporary, some of their responses in being flat-out denials of obvious truth.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1180s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1182s)

Brainwashing runs so deep. But to any kids listening, like, I never went to university and I fulfilled my dreams in terms of a career. So it's, if you're not sure, like, I know that I'm speaking to somebody at the moment and they're not sure, their kids, you know, like filling out their education in there and, and what, they're worried that they're not going to be able to pursue a career of what they want to do.

And I'm like, "It doesn't matter." Like, I think university is losing credibility more and more unless you're like a doctor or [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1212s) vet. Like, it's not, not, it's not as important to have a university credential behind you. And you as a teacher, Tim, might disagree, but I, I'm finding it less and less for people that I've, you know, helped to try and get a job. It's less and less important to have a university credential. But I'm just giving some hope to kids that are...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1230s)

And the thing is, it comes down to choice though, right? Like you were able to have the choice on whether you did that. I didn't do university either, right? Do I wish I had? I do. I do wish that I had. I would have went into psychology 110%. But the thing is, it's about choice.

It's about taking that choice away from someone because that is the prize that sits inside every freaking child, is the capability of learning how to choose what you want. That's what [school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1260s) is supposed to do. It's supposed to give you these like intellectual conversations, intellectual teachings that teach you how to make choice. Who are you? Like what, like you, that's what you need to know. Who am I? And that is what is wiped away from the church.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1281s)

And I, yeah, I was going to say that the, it comes back to critical thinking. And if they had enabled and fostered and encouraged critical thinking within children, well, they wouldn't have a cult. Because if you had the time and the cognitive awareness to critically analyze your life within the cult, like us have done, you wouldn't be there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1304s)

What restrictions did you face inside there that you wouldn't face in a normal school?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1313s)

The biggest one, and since I've started a new job since then in another school, the biggest thing I've noticed is just resources and access to resources, media. So being able to access YouTube videos and that sort of thing has been, in the new school I'm at, you can just pull up a YouTube video and the kids can watch it.

In OSG, it has to be approved first. So it has to go through a big process of being approved. Any website, any YouTube clip, any books or anything like that, all has to be approved [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1343s) you can use it. And it has to be vetted by the community before you can use it. So, big restrictions on what you're able to show the kids.

They, from this year, have started the new book list for the schools. And so they've put out a list for Australia of a hundred books that they're allowed to have within the, give or take a hundred, books they're allowed to have within the school. And so there's a list for from year three up to year 12, and it starts off in year three, they might have 20 books, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1373s) year four, they'll be that 20 plus another 10\. By the time they get to year 12, there's about 100\. So it's not even 100 for each year group, it's as they get older to access them.

We had a school, like a little school library, which was already approved by members of the community. They went through and vetted each of the books that were in this library. And I'd say there probably would have been a couple of, maybe a thousand books, give or take. Like, that was only small, it was maybe 800\. Everything that wasn't on that list had [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1403s) get thrown out or donated. This year, they've gotten rid of everything except the books that they've put on this new list.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1410s)

What, you mean they emptied their own pre-approved library to bring it in accord with the 100 statutory book list?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1420s)

That's right. Yep. Everything that was proven.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGyodryYhHRg%26t%3D1422s)

That does sound like communism. I read quite a bit of sort of dystopian science fiction, you know, where the world's descended into some kind of neo-communist nightmare. And of course, it's all about burning books. And wow, you know, someone discovers a book in the rubble, and they don't even know what it is. But I mean, this is happening in Australia today.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1444s)

I made that joke to some of the teachers as well. I said it's, yeah, nothing like a good old-fashioned book burning. We'll go through the library and literally pull out everything that's not on the, that's not even a banned book list. It's a, "Everything but this is banned" book list.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1461s)

Wow. Yeah. I mean, back in my day, they just glued pages together or ripped out chapters. Like, I think there's a part in *Merchant of Venice* or one of the Shakespeare where they talk about breasts or something. You know, my inquiring mind found out from a public library what was missing because I was, "There's a plot hole here," because they'd ripped out whole chapters, whereas I guess now it's just resorting to chucking out the whole book.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1489s)

Yeah, they were doing that last year. They were going through and putting a black pen through certain parts of books that were approved, but then they had to be then censored. But yeah, this year they've gone through and just thrown out everything but what's allowed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1503s)

For them, five years and their, their library is just going to be Bruce's ministry.

I don't even know what to say. Like, I don't even, I'm just...

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1517s)

Within the two years that I was there, it's gotten worse. It's gotten more strict and more controlled within that two years that I was there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1523s)

Yet again, they preach the opposite, right? And I think this is why I'm getting so many teenagers reaching out now where they're like, "Okay, this is, I know this is not where I want to be." And like, "Where do I go from here?" Right? Like it's, and most of the teenagers that I talk to want to talk to the teachers, but they're so afraid of confidentiality. And like, they don't want anybody finding out that they're planning on leaving as soon as grade 12 is over, right? [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1553s) I mean, if it's going into this kind of a rabbit hole, I mean, they're, they're shooting themselves in the foot.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1560s)

Yeah, I was, I was getting indirect conversations with kids about certain things that were, yeah, new restrictions coming in for the school and that sort of thing. And they were just all very, like, even the kids were saying, "Well, three years ago, they were allowed to do this. Why aren't we allowed to?" Like, they were getting to the point of, yeah, it's, they could see it was getting more strict on what they're allowed to do.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1587s)

The sad thing is, Tim, that's nothing new. I remember having the same conversations with our teachers. You know, kids were allowed the previous years, watched *Rabbit-Proof Fence*. We've got to our year, you know, by the end of the year, oh sorry, I think it was our year, and then certain kids then weren't allowed to. Like, it's something as simple as, you know, awareness as to the atrocities that happened to Australia's First Nations people.

Of course, the Brethren aren't really, you know, recognizing that, as much as they like to showcase that they do on Rapid, the Rapid Relief [Team.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1617s) You know, they had very racist views, so they only showed it because it was curriculum here in New South Wales to have something like that. But yeah, no, nothing's changed then.

And the scary thing is though, I always, I don't know what your thoughts are on this, is like studying certain cults and how they came to a head and ended, like the Jim Jones cults and things like that. Like, the older the leader gets, the more [frenzied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1648s) the rules become and stricter it becomes to a point where either they have a massive squib or something horrific like the Jim Jones massacre. What are your thoughts on that? Like, do you, like on the longevity of the sustainability of the school, for example?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1666s)

Yeah, I think you're right. I think it's, as I said, it seems like it's getting more strict and it seems like they're sort of circling the wagons to try and maintain control. And I think the kids are realizing, like there's so many avenues out there if they look for them, I guess, with social media and different things that kids are starting to realize there are other things out there. And I think it's, yeah, it's that power fight at the moment to try and maintain it from higher up. That's the sort of the [impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1696s) that I was getting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1697s)

When you were teaching, can you remember anything off the top of your head of like things that weren't taught in the school system that you know should have been taught in the school system? Like, what are some differences where you're, "Well, we didn't teach that at OSG and I'm teaching it here"?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1713s)

Yeah, that's a tricky one because they did, they did try to stick to the curriculum, I guess, as much as possible. I know for, for a fact, and I think it's been said on here before, like when they get to year 11 and 12, they don't offer certain subjects. And they've said in the past, I think from one of the other people who was on, they try and spin it as, "Oh, we just run the subjects that have got the most interest," so all the, that we have the ability to.

So if we don't have a teacher to teach that, we can't teach it, or if there's not enough [students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1743s) to get a class together. But yeah, when they put out their program for what subjects are available for, say, year 12s or year 11s starting this year, those subjects weren't there. So biology, arts, so like creative or visual arts, I think, yeah. Yeah, no ancient, I don't think, no, there wasn't an ancient class, no.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1764s)

Yeah, there were, there were certain topics like that that you weren't allowed to do.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1769s)

Yep, and there was definitely teachers who could teach them, and there was teachers who were frustrated because they weren't able to teach their specialization. So an art teacher who wasn't able to teach art in year 11 and 12\. And the reasoning for that was they could control what was in the curriculum at school, but because it's a HSC subject, they couldn't control what was in the exam paper. So the kids might see artworks that are not approved, basically, when they got [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1799s) exam time. And that was the rationale for not offering that subject.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1805s)

I experienced when my, when my own kids were going through, it was before it was called OneSchool Global, but they made on their paper and on their brochures, they presented what looked like, you know, a half-decent array of subjects. But when you actually applied for them, it came back, "Oh, no, you can't actually do that," or "There's not enough students," or "There's not enough teachers."

And what it all boiled down to is that everyone was steered into a very narrow range of [business-related](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1835s) or business-useful subjects with a very heavy emphasis on accounting and business management and, you know, a very, very narrow commercial range of things. And the very sort of not impressive, but at least decent range of subjects that their prospectus showed, in practice, there was no actual way to do them. So it was, it was window dressing.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1863s)

Yeah, and to that point, year nine and ten in New South Wales at least, the commerce subject is generally, it's an elective for most schools, and they made it a mandatory subject for the kids in year nine and ten. So they had to, had to do commerce, or they have to do, yeah, that will lead that into financial or business subjects for year 11 and 12\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1887s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, when, I mean now, but accounting used to be mandatory as well in the OneSchool Global system. Like, everyone has to do accounting, which is a nightmare subject if you're like me, you're just not a math person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1904s)

Well, same. I was like, "How many pretty vases can I see in an equation?"

I don't think, like, in the sense that your school is a very different school to another teacher that I know that was an art teacher, and she had the same struggle with wanting a certain group of brilliant children that were great at art in year 7, 8, 9, or whenever they did it, and weren't allowed to do it. And she begged and pleaded for them because these kids really wanted to. She knew they'd be great at it for a year 12 subject.

And the response she [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1942s) me she got was, "We can't control what object they might be given in the final." For example, they said to her, "For example, you know, Michelangelo's David," which we all know is like, obviously, a nude statue of a male.

Yeah, the mental gymnastics one has to do to unpack the, it shows up the disconnect between the people, the board that run the school with actual kids that go to school or when you were at school. Like, if you were that thirsty for a nude image, you had to wait for the year 12 final, whatever they think it is. Like, it's unbelievable. It's again, maintaining that impossible standard of purity that number one rule in [cults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=1991s) is.

I had a question for you, Tim. Did you ever come across, let's just start with one, for example, because I'm a passionate advocate for it. Did you ever come across any homophobia within there?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2005s)

Yes. Yes. And it's one of those things where it's like the actions of the kids and you're sort of, it's bad, but you can't, I feel personally, like I feel like the kids would do better if they knew better. So that you can't blame the kids personally for the, some of the things.

So there was an example of, there was, I think it was Pride Week, and the local oval had off banners or streamers and balloons and stuff up around the [local](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2035s) soccer club, and the kids went up there for sport one afternoon and pulled them all down, pulled down all the balloons and streamers and stuff, all the pride stuff. And like, yeah, made a point of destroying it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2049s)

Like, how do you reprimand that? Like, what conflict are you left with? Because to pull a child up on that, but also not cross the boundary of being like, not supporting the school's ethos and morals, you know?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2059s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So the principal, yeah, sort of told them the next week before we went, it was sort of told at the time, "Oh, you can't do that sort of thing." It wasn't a big deal made about it. And then the next week, the principal said to them, "Look, if you can't go up there and be respectful of other people in the community, then don't go."

And yeah, a couple of the kids at the back were sort of sniggering and going, "Oh, well, guess we're staying here then." Like, very open about it. And yeah, and then there was no like conversation [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2089s) it or anything like that, which you would normally try and do and let them see other people's viewpoint as educators. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Like, it's a, it's a teachable moment, I guess. And it's just a matter of, "Okay, well, either you, you can come or you can't." You can have, like, and I mean, yeah, they're entitled to their opinion, but it's a shitty opinion, and there's definitely a better way to, to educate kids about that. It was very much just brushed aside. I was like, "That's bad, don't do that."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2118s)

Interesting. In a similar campus, in a similar situation in a separate campus, I remember there was footage, I think, as well of kids going to an open university day where they have little stands to show you what the university can offer. And they had a Pride stand. And I think one of the, one of the, a couple of them were obviously heckling the Pride stand. And then the Pride stand student, university students stood up themselves, and then one, I think one particular [student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2149s) just went literally nuts and started attacking and tearing things, and there were people there filming it, it's all on, like it's on footage.

And I just remember afterwards hearing teachers say they were so caught because they were like, "We had to pull this kid out of it, but didn't want our faces on the footage of a viral moment." And, you know, and it points up, you know, the importance of respecting communities where you're in a world of everything is on camera. Everything is accountable. You can be held accountable at any moment.

And yet [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2188s) teachers like you guys are really caught between a rock and a hard place of like protecting the student and pulling them out of it, but then also not showing that you support it because then to the greater world, if you're there on camera supporting it, you represent the same morals as the school. Like, I just, yeah, I really feel sorry, like looking back now, what some of your teachers had to go through.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2208s)

Yeah, yeah, definitely. And there was a big thing at the start of, like, literally when I started, there was a new contract brought in for the teachers. And so it was, it was given to the teachers on the last day of the previous term before the six-week break. And it was like, "Here's your new contract. You have to sign it before you start back next year."

And when I came in, there was all this discussion around all these things that have been put in this new contract. And one of them was around social media and teachers' use of social media. And it was, yeah, "You can't put anything on your [personal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2238s) Facebook that would contradict the values of the Brethren community." Yep.

That was a big, like, conversation with teachers was like, "Well, am I going to get in trouble? Am I going to lose my job because I've got this, this, or this?" My sister-in-law is in a same-sex relationship, and it's like, "Well, can I not post photos of me with the family because she's with a girlfriend in this photo?" Like, it was that sort of stuff.

And yeah, the teachers were all within the staff room having these big conversations about, "Well, am I going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2268s) lose my job or get reprimanded for something that I've posted on my Facebook?" It was, yeah. And that's the level of, yeah, I guess restriction they try and put on people. And it's, it seems to be with the teachers' contracts. They try things even if they can't, even if it's not able to be backed up, and they just see what they can get away with, basically. They just, they push things until they get actually stopped from doing them, and that was one of them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2295s)

I can't believe that. I'm just, I'm shocked. That's like being in part, like, Tim, that's like you being inside the PBCC and you're just not going to church every day, right? Like, I cannot believe that. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2309s)

This is a great example to show the control, right? It's not just in the school, it affects your whole life, your whole family, just by being associated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2318s)

I just am, I'm just absolutely shocked that they had that kind of control over you guys.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2325s)

So what happened? Did it remain in the contract?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2330s)

Yeah, people were actually eventually just given an ultimatum and told, "If you don't sign it, we'll have to have a big conversation about your employment." Nothing was changed. Yeah, a few people took it to the unions and that sort of thing. And I was, yeah, I was like, "Well, they can't really enforce this." But yeah, they pushed it the point of, "If you don't sign this, we'll have to have a bigger conversation."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2349s)

That's shocking.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2351s)

Yeah, and I do know of another teacher that didn't sign it, but they were made to feel so uncomfortable over the whole thing to the point where they were obviously looking for other reasons to move you along because you don't align with their ethos anyway if you support anything that doesn't agree with them, especially something like Pride or anything like that.

The other thing too is that they have cracked down on essentially finding out, obviously it's illegal, it's a [discrimination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2381s) to fire somebody over their relationship. And there was a teacher I know of that got so sick, I think, of hearing kids during Pride Week talk about how awful it was and blah, blah, blah, the usual rhetoric that they're taught, and the hate that comes with that.

They were in a same-sex relationship and turned around and faced the kids and said, "What's the big deal?" And then the kids were like, because you got so defensive, the kids did all this homework, found out who it [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2411s) found that they were in a same-sex relationship, and that person has disappeared that weekend.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2416s)

What was your experience like with mental health and the resources that were available in there?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2423s)

One of, so Headspace, Beyond Blue, Kids Helpline, all those sort of things were all blocked by Streamline. The main reason for that was because of the stuff that's on there about, well, the main given reason was because of the stuff that's on there about sexuality, different things to do around kids, yeah, or people's sexualities and that sort of thing. Sure, yeah.

Um, yeah, terrible, basically. That was one of the main reasons that I left because I actually felt that it was dangerous for the kids who are in there, their lack of resources and the lack of support that they could get from anywhere for mental health and well-being sort of support.

And I tried myself, I tried because there was a student view you could go into as a teacher. So teachers were able to access a little bit more than students were through Streamline, but you could go into student view. And I went into that and I actually tried myself to access Beyond Blue, Headspace, Kids Helpline, and they're all blocked.

And also the other reason that I was given again by this [head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2483s) of Australian learning support was, "Well-being and mental health, the community deal with that side of things, not the school." And it was told black and white. I think the words were, "The community see that as they're, their kids in their community, and they'll handle it the way they want to, and the teachers aren't to address it, basically."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2506s)

And so is that illegal to not report or...

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2508s)

Look, I think, yeah, in terms of mandatory reporting, yes, there's all processes that need to be followed. And I think the way they were trying to get away with it was that the school's process was to report it and the community handle it. And I was told that the people at the top will make a call to the community members who do the pastoral care and they'll handle it after that.

It's not for us to handle. Teachers may not even get a response as to how it's been handled or if it's been handled or if the [kid's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2538s) doing any better. Just basically just told, "Leave it alone, don't, don't discuss it."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2544s)

It's, it's so counterintuitive though, because by ignoring the problem, it doesn't go away.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2550s)

No, they seek us out. As a teacher, how does that make you feel, being up against something that large that those kids can't, can't get help for?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2563s)

Yep, terrible, absolutely terrible. I ended up leaving because of my own mental health issues that I had based on these issues like this, with not being able to support kids and just being stuck in that feeling, completely helpless up against the system. Yeah, I was told basically the community will handle mental health issues and it's not up to the teachers.

I was told at one point, I was told off basically by the principal for [trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2593s) to help a kid with some strategies. And I said to him, like, "Look, all I'm doing...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2597s)

Is the principal Brethren or non-Brethren?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2600s)

Non-Brethren. But again, I think has been hired by the Brethren because he will do exactly what they say. I was asked by the parents of a student to help a kid with some work as learning support. And then the principal said, "Can you do this?" And I said, "Yeah, of course I can." I did it.

And then the next day he said, "Oh, actually the CA, so the community advisor or whoever they are from the community, saw you were working with this kid and you shouldn't have been working with them as much as you are, so don't do that." So he was, yeah, he was being dictated by the community side of things as to what the teachers are allowed to do.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2641s)

It's just so bizarre hearing this because it sounds like every other teacher that has worked there from campuses all over, to England, you know, all over the world that have shared their story. It sounds like the same story. It sounds like you're telling the same story.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2657s)

Yeah, yeah, and it just, I guess it goes to show the problems don't go away.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2660s)

The problems don't go away.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2661s)

Yeah, I think so. It's, yeah, I think as I said, I think the people who are at the top or who have positions of power are those sort of people who will do what is asked of them of their job. Then they're the, they're the "just following orders" people, basically.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2680s)

So did you find other teachers shared your concerns but were just keeping quiet about them?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2684s)

Yep, yeah, definitely. In personal conversations I had with some teachers, those sort of things would come up where they'd be like, "Oh yeah, these kids, different past students," and that sort of thing. It'd be like, "Oh yeah, they're really good at this. It was a shame they couldn't go on and do further studies in XYZ."

Or it'd be, "It's terrible. We've got to get rid of all these books and everything." Or, "Yeah, the way we're teaching these subjects on Zoom doesn't make sense and it's not good for the kids and they're not learning, but I've got a mortgage to pay, so I'm going to shut up and go along with it."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2721s)

Again, I hear this from teachers. Like, that's, that's not prioritizing children's education and which you're in charge of. And particularly in this instance, being a part of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, you know that they're already struggling with a very skewed reality.

So it's more than just education that these kids are battling or learning. They're learning life skills, which you're fostering, you're enabling. So how are you any different to another Brethren [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2752s) enables an abuse? Like, it's so toxic and it does attract the toxic people and keeps them there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2758s)

I think what's going to have to happen is teachers are going to have to have a very deep moral look into what they are accompanying and ask themselves, "What is the solution to this problem?" And for me, if they couldn't hire the teachers, they would have to change. That's how I see one side of the solution to this is like, what would you say to teachers who are wanting to go and work and apply at OSG?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2786s)

Yeah, basically that think about who the kids are, and think about your own moral, ethical values. It's not somewhere where these kids are going to have a good outcome. Basically, they're not, you're not going to be able to teach the kids any worthwhile skills if it doesn't align with what the Brethren want you to teach them.

And you're not going to be able to help any kids if they don't allow that. And I've, as I said, I have pretty much got this in black and white from the head of learning [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2816s) that, yeah, it's their way or the highway.

I mentioned that I had ideas, like as learning support, I had quite a few. That was my job to try and find ways to help kids access their learning. So try and find ways to support the kids to be able to learn. And I was giving recommendations to all different teachers across all different subjects and none of it was really getting put in place.

And I said to the head of learning support, "So I've got these ideas. Why, like, what else can we do to make sure the kids are learning?" And their [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2847s) was, "Well, if it's not what Global has told us to do, then we won't be able to do it." She said, "If they come in and look at the school and say, 'Why are you doing this this way?' we'll get in a lot of trouble because we're not doing it the way that they've told us to do it."

And that comes right down to differentiating content and differentiating learning for students who need extra support. It comes down to, "If we're not doing it their way, then it's not allowed."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2869s)

Just say a bit more about differentiating students for their needs. How did that work out?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2876s)

Yeah, so basically, obviously, learning support. So there's kids who have ADHD, autism, all different kinds of different learning needs. The approach they're taking here, especially in high school, is that all their classes are being taught on Zoom by a teacher who's most often off campus.

And so I would be suggesting these teachers, "We need to put in place different scaffolds," or "We need to do extra explanations for certain kids." Just wasn't happening. It just wasn't getting done. And the teachers, because they're off-site, don't know the kids that they're [teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2906s) well enough to know what they need. And I think that's by design. I honestly think that is by design.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2914s)

That was going to be one of my questions. I wanted to ask you that. Is that, do you believe the way they teach things is because they say they're up to, you know, this incredible system that they have, or do you think it's a system of control?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2927s)

Yeah, it's a, it's a separation thing as far as I'm concerned. It's keeping the students separate from the teachers as much as possible. And then that has the effect of the teachers don't understand the needs of the kids, and then they can't support them to learn the best way possible.

And it just moves on, basically. It just moves on. Yeah, if the kids aren't learning. So they'd be kids who weren't handing in assignments, they'll be getting zeros on assignments, and it's just, "Okay, you got a zero, go to the next one." The kid goes, "Oh, well, I'll just get zero. Okay, I don't care." There's no talking [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2958s) it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2958s)

The Zoom teaching, which is particularly bad for children with some kind of learning difficulty. Yep. And is that increasing in the school? Are they doing more and more Zoom teaching?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2972s)

Yeah, so high school in New South Wales, and it's going to be, I'm assuming across Australia, is all on Zoom now, bar maybe a couple of lessons where they would have teachers on campus and they'd be teaching Zoom and in person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2989s)

So we would have... Essentially, they're sitting at a square box all day. Yep, all day. How is that? I wouldn't have coped. I wouldn't have coped as a kid. Terrible.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=2999s)

Yeah, and then they don't, they aren't coping with it, and they aren't putting anything in place to make it any easier either. So I was suggesting things like, "Can we build in brain breaks and things into the timetable?" And it was just like, "Oh, no, no, that's not how we do it."

Yeah, so that was rolled out start of last year, was that all the high school would be on Zoom. And so we would have, for example, we'd have a science teacher who could teach science on campus, but she was teaching kids in Orange and [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3029s) else was it? Orange and, I can't remember. But she was teaching, say, two, two campuses off-site, and then our kids in the same year group were getting taught by a teacher from Sydney.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3046s)

Well, like... And just to give perspective to listeners, that's like teachers teaching students in like four, four-hour differences, like in terms of distance. Like, so you can't, like, put your hand up and just come over and have a look at this. Yeah, it's like distant education but modernized.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3065s)

Yeah, and when there's the ability to have a bit on in person, so there was teachers available, but they were deliberately making it so they were teaching kids who weren't in front of them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3076s)

Wow. So when they talk about in all their news articles that they have this state-of-the-art education system, what would your response be to that?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3088s)

It's technology. Yeah, the state-of-the-art, the technology doesn't make it good teaching practice. Yeah, in fact, it's the reverse of that. I think having that technology makes it look flashy, but it is the reverse. It's not good teaching practice.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3103s)

They don't know if you break it down. The technology is so restricted, right, as well.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3107s)

Like, it's not exactly. Yep, that's right. Yeah, there's no access to anything, really. There was quite often times, because I was learning support, I was across all different subjects with all different kids. So I'd see a bunch of, I'd be in that learning area, the learning center all day, which means I got to build up some relationships with the kids.

And I was trying to be consistent for them, which is what ended up getting me in trouble and ended up me needing to leave because I was caring too much and doing too [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3137s) and needed to get back in my box, basically. Yeah, I would have kids coming up to me saying, "I've got to do this assignment, I've got to make a poster for geography. Can you find some images for me and send them to me? Because I can't access any images to be able to do the work because it's all blocked by Streamline."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3154s)

I don't even, I just, like, I just can't believe that they are able to legally run schools like this. And I think that's why it's so important for teachers like you to come on here and really explain to the public and explain to government officials and explain people who are governing things that this is not a functional school for these children. What it does is it [keeps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3185s) them very contained inside the cult, which is what they're looking for.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3189s)

Yeah, exactly. I, as an example, and I want to protect the identity of a different kid, so I won't say too much, but I, I told this, she's really not going to like me after this podcast. I told this head of learning support about this certain student who has autism who was struggling really bad all year, had said to his mom that he thinks he's going to have to repeat the year because he doesn't think he's learned anything.

And the response from the head of learning support for Australia was, "Look, take [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3219s) comfort in the fact that he's going to get a job with his family business when he leaves here. So don't worry about it too much. We can take comfort in the fact he's going to be looking, he's going to be looked after. The community won't let him suffer. The community will look after him. They have 100% employment rate when they leave school. So he's not going to..."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3238s)

Was the head of learning support Brethren, just to clarify? Was the head of learning support, or they might as well have been. They've drunk the Kool-Aid by the sounds.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3246s)

That's what I mean. It's this lockstep. It's this lockstep of, "This is what they say, this is what we do." And, like, I just, that was one of the breaking points for me was where I just went, "This isn't..." Like, I knew it was not okay up until then, but then that was when I've gone, "No, I'm out of here. This is not..." Like, and that's why I'm doing this podcast, because I did everything I could for those kids within the school as much as possible. I tried as much as I could within the confines of the school. And it's now reached the point where I had to leave to be able to do anymore because this is [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3280s) only way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3281s)

Right. Like, you have to be able to live with yourself at the end of the day, right? And I, I'm like, my heart goes out to you as somebody who has dealt for years with children and saw what they needed and wanted to be able to give them everything they needed to be able to sit where you sat for two years and come out there with even your head on your shoulders still is an absolute win.

It's just like, heaven forbid you give children comfort or give children what they needed in there, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3312s)

It's terrifying to hear similar stories across the globe, across multiple schools. Someone shared a story of a, and I won't reveal the location, obviously, to protect both, but of a child that was self-harming, like to that extent. And I know I went through similar stages of, you know, trying to process the pain of what I felt growing up in that school, in that toxic environment, to being like, "Well, the pain I can feel is what I'm doing to myself."

And I know that this [teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3342s) had a real struggle to be like, "I have to stay here because this child has nothing else, no one else, and if I leave, then I've got to leave with the fact that I've left this child to the wolves, or do I stay and sort of compromise a lot, like come to a compromise with a lot of my morals, ethics, and values for the sake of a child?"

And I was just like, I don't even know. As a kid that has experienced that, I don't even know. Like, I would say thank you, but like, how did, [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3373s) you ever come across anything like that? Were you ever put in an ultimatum like that?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3377s)

Yeah, very, very similar. I was struggling with my own comprehension of what to do in that situation, basically. And yeah, I had the conversation with my family about, I couldn't make that compromise to be able to stay there and do things their way. Like, it was a hill I would die on of if I, yeah, I could get another job if I get fired, if I get in trouble by the school and I get fired, I can get another job.

But if this, if certain, like, yeah, if things spiraled, if kids in that school weren't getting support and something, yeah, like, heaven forbid, if a student took their own life or something like that, that's something I'd have to live with, knowing that I made that moral compromise of, "I could have [supported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3418s) them, but I didn't."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3418s)

I guess I just want to plead, I just want to plead with the OSG teachers. It is so important for the voices to come out right now. These are, these are children's lives. Like, I know this world is run by billions of people, right? And we get very busy and part of our sensory overload makes us protect our heart and protect our eyes with what we see and what we feel.

It is [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3448s) important when you are a teacher, somebody who's in a situation where you're caretaking for children, you can't become desensitized. You have to stay awake. You have to stay alive. These are children's lives that we are dealing with. And I think it is just so, so, so important for people just to start speaking out loud, whether you lose your job, whether, I mean, I know that is a scary thing, but you have to put yourself as if [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3479s) is your child. What would you do? You wouldn't stand for it.

Like to me, all children are my children. I, when I did, I did day home for 12 years, every child that came through my house, and I got all the children that went from day home to day home to day home, ended up in my home because I couldn't say no. And to me, I was curious what, like, I wanted to be that safety for them, right? But every child that came through my door was my child.

And I think it's so important that we start viewing the [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3509s) like this. This is our next generation, right? And I just think it's just so important that we have to put our foot down and put our fears aside and do what needs to be done. OneSchool Global should not be a functioning school. It should not be. It has to be shut down. Or it has to go through some sort of a government regulation that is not governed by the church. There should be no church affiliates inside that school.

And those children should have [access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3539s) to mental health. They should have access to a full curriculum. They should have access to sex education. They should have access to mental health helplines. They should have access to everything all of our children have access to. There shouldn't be a separation with that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3556s)

And more importantly, like I was just thinking what you're saying before, Tim, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the head of learning support and how they approach that conversation with you. They're there to provide physical, social, emotional, intellectual support on a holistic level, all-rounded approach. They of all people should have kind of, I guess you could say, the values or the beacon of moral code that they're [supposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3586s) to be holding up for children, especially with learning difficulties.

How do you then respond like that? How do you... And sleep at night. Like, honestly, and I always think about, like, the way we were taught at school by these, you know, and as a former student, we put the teachers on pedestals because you were a beacon of light to us. In the terms of for the kids of us that were aware enough to know that we lived in a dark place and had nowhere else to turn to, like, you know, the limited resources that we had.

And [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3620s) me, in the schooling years, we didn't really have computers until sort of midway through high school. And then it was nothing really accessible at all. And I guess nothing's changed. But teachers were the ones that told us stories. Teachers were the ones that taught us history. Teachers were the ones that told us of heroes, of people that changed history, of people that were on the right side of history. Okay, well then, now's your time. Now's your time to step up and be on the right side of history. You taught us to.

Let's all come together and do that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3653s)

Yeah. What was the role of women at OSG? Or what did you see? What was the difference between observing the females there versus the males?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3664s)

So the, yeah, the mothers, grandmothers were probably more involved in the school in certain ways. So they'd be in there for canteen. They'd be delivering things from campus and co, like lunches and that sort of thing. I think a lot of that was just to be able to have something to do, to be honest. It seemed like they liked the social side of it.

There was actually a, there was a couple of mums from one of the new, like, year groups that came through who were struggling [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3694s) not feeling very connected, like not having anywhere to talk about their kids starting this new school, the things that their kids are struggling with, and that sort of thing. And somebody within the school set up a sort of like a little mums group, a tea circle for the mums to come in once a fortnight and have a sit down and have a cup of tea and talk to each other about the school and about things going on.

And originally that was approved, like it was okay by the principal. And I think twice, and then it was shut down [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3724s) the Brethren men in there. Yeah, it was cancelled.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGyodryYhHRg%26t%3D3728s)

The fellowship within the fellowship, probably. 

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3738s)

There was maybe, there was maybe six or seven who came to the first one, and then there was about four who came to the second one, and then after about three weeks, it was shut down because somebody, obviously husbands or people within the community had heard about it, and they didn't want women gathering on their own to discuss things, was the vibe.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3757s)

You know, this is like their AA group chat that they had on WhatsApp. And again, it was people, women supporting women, right? And it was shut down too. I want to ask you a question. So when you talk about global, things coming from global. So I want to, I want to, I want to make sure that the viewers and listeners are getting this right.

The, it is a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. They're setting out these rules and then finding the principals, finding the head of things that could, that align with their beliefs so that these rules are enforced, right? It is not the principals that are, that are coming up with these rules. It is in fact the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Am I correct?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3798s)

Yes, yeah. So the, the church, and so global in terms of the school is the head of, yeah, Global OneSchool, I guess. There's a bloke, Matt Phillips, he's in charge. He's from the UK.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3813s)

Oh yes, Matt Phillips. I have heard that name whispered amongst ex-teacher communities and ex-teacher chats, but yeah, apparently he had it in for learning support from day one.

That sounds about right. I think the general opinion was pompous asshole, but don't quote me, it's alleged.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3834s)

Yeah. And he's basically the mafia boss of OneSchool. So he'll go around, he came and did a tour of Australia. He came to our campus and maybe a couple of months later, our principal had been there for 20 years was gone because of things that he didn't agree with.

And then he came back the next year and everyone was like, "Look, we know what happened last time. Don't be worried about it. He's coming in. He's probably going to say these things need to change, whatever else, but we'll show him what a good school [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3865s) are." And that was when all the heads of department found out that they didn't have a job anymore because it was moving to an Australia-wide system.

So this guy comes in and he would, I don't know, he's not Brethren, but he just must be completely in line with their beliefs because he would come in and stand there at the back of the classroom and talk to other people around him and say, "This needs to change, this needs to change, this needs to change," within the classroom, just little things. And he'd come in and just [demand,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3895s) like dictate what had to be changed.

So he's the head of the school, and then within Australia, there's like the regional heads, so the Australian heads of education, who then also have a school board who's on the same level who they get their direction from as well. Yeah, he walked in the first day, the first meeting, I didn't actually talk to him, but he walked into the school with two people, one either side of him, in a full suit, just like godfather vibes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3923s)

Oh man.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3924s)

That was the thing from the head of learning support, was basically, "If you support this kid in this way and Matt Phillips finds out that you're doing this and it's not something that's done at the rest of the school, then we'll get in trouble for it," even if that's what that kid needs to be able to learn.

Wow. It's the Disability Standards for Education, it's called in Australia and New South Wales, is the legal requirement of schools to provide learning support to kids with a disability. And so they're going against that. Like, it's a legal document that says that schools need to provide this sort of stuff. But I was being told that, "No, we can't provide it if it's not in line with what OSG wants."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3964s)

Wow.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3965s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3965s)

And he sat in a board in a different country?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3970s)

Yeah, he's from the UK.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3973s)

Yeah, which is so, it's so baffling to me that how you expect the learning support to be unanimously the same for kids with varied disabilities. Like, it's just, it's all abilities. It's crazy. Yeah. Well, I just, I think it just comes down to, they don't want the kids to learn.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3992s)

Exactly. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3994s)

Well, they want them all as robots ready for the workforce, essentially.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=3996s)

Yeah. That was one of the things I thought of before in terms of like them being robots. The kids that I mentioned before were saying it was better before, like kids before them got to do other things. There was little things like end-of-year celebrations. Like last year, that was all, they weren't allowed to do any year 12 celebration at the school.

So they didn't, like, obviously they don't do a big like muck-up day or anything like a public school would. They don't get, they [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4027s) like a lunch that was previously done for the other years and it was cancelled because they weren't allowed to do that anymore. Or year six kids going into year seven, they used to have like a, "You've graduated primary school," like, yeah, one day out at the end and some banners and stuff. That was all cancelled.

And there was a memo that went around that said, "There's to be no celebrations for end of year six because it's not that they're finishing school, they're just going from year six to year seven. It's not to be celebrated." Like, they're taking, sucking all the joy out of [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4057s) a kid at the school, basically, in terms of just making them robots.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4060s)

Exactly. That's what I was just going to say. This, this is their way of making them the shell of what they can program them with, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4066s)

Yeah. So did you see a lot of teachers, did you see a high rate of turnover of staff in the, in the school there?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4074s)

Not at, not at my campus. The staff of my campus have been there quite a while. But then Sydney, I think Sydney had, oh, it was every other, every other day there was people coming and going. They had a massive turnover. I think they've had three principals in the last year. It's just really, that campus has really kept turning people over.

And I don't know whether that's people are coming in and then realizing what they've gotten themselves into. Now, people at my campus have been there quite a while, most of them. And I think that's where I was different, where I came in and [realized,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4105s) "Hang on a second, this isn't right." Whereas the others, it's sort of, I don't know, it's like a boiled frog situation maybe for some of them, where they've been there and it changes around them and they don't realize how much of it's changed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4116s)

Or they change themselves without realizing it, so they're conforming.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4121s)

Yeah. Look, like, I do know a couple of teachers that have said that it started out as like a little school, a, you know, a small little Christian school that just got progressively worse. And by the time you realized the panic that you're in or the environment that you're in, you know, eight years are gone or four years, and then you pull yourself out of it, it's like the whole wall has lifted and you're like, "What the hell? Like, what was I doing?"

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4147s)

And even some of the kids have, kids have realized that too. So some of the kids who are getting towards the end of school now was saying to me last year, "I wish we could go back to when it was MET school. It was always better when it was MET school before it became OSG."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4164s)

Well, well, as a former MET school student that was on the cusp of becoming OneSchool, it wasn't any better. You can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4174s)

It's getting more and more globally centralized control and less and less teacher-student interaction. So in that sense, it's, it's getting more intrusive.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4186s)

In your campus, what was bullying like?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4190s)

There wasn't too much bullying that I noticed as such, but there was, as we, I don't know if we've talked about it before, racism. So yeah, any kids with darker skin would be picked on. And it was sort of that like, "Oh, no, no, it's just a joke," but it kept happening. Like, it was that sort of, they'd keep bringing it up in the school and say something to the kids about, "Oh, that's not okay," but it was these kids in particular who knew who they were and everybody else knew who they were too. And it was all these like sly [comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4220s) and snide jokes and things like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4222s)

Did you ever observe children and question whether they were being abused, whether there was abuse happening?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4231s)

Because it's such a small community, some of the teachers would mention, "Oh, well, we know this parent at home is really strict or really harsh," or, there was even a couple of cases of like, "Oh, well, the kid's done the wrong thing, but we won't call home because we know that the parent is over the top when it comes to discipline." Okay.

But never any, like, there wasn't any issue, like, there wasn't any times where I was like, "I need to make a report." Like, okay, yeah. There was never anything, yeah, revealed or like direct that I would have said was [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4261s) or that I was, that I knew of. But there was definitely cases of where, yeah, the family was known for XYZ, like, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4270s)

Yeah, back to the racism thing, was it a predominantly white school then? Like, like, like I know for me, there were teachers, I had an Indian food tech teacher who, we went through them because they kept getting Indian food tech teachers and the kids were horrifically racist.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4289s)

Yeah, there was a bit of that with some of the teachers on Zoom. So there was Asian teachers on Zoom who would, the kids would comment about, they'd make racist sort of remarks about these teachers who weren't white who were teaching them on Zoom. And either it was heard by somebody in the room because the kids were muted, or they'd say it in the chat. The kids didn't realize what they were saying. They didn't realize that that's not appropriate because that's right.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4317s)

We find this with people when they leave the cult. They will quite sort of innocently make a racist remark or use a word in public that is completely taboo, just not even realizing that that's not acceptable in the real world. And I mean, these are, these are the kids that have come through this school, and then they've got this huge social handicap if they do leave, that they've got no idea what rules actually apply outside.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4346s)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4348s)

I want to jump into Sarah Martin from *The Guardian*. She did a whole series of articles on OneSchool Global that I want to run through. Okay, so this is the first article that she did. Ben's sporting the front cover. And this article goes on to Ben's whole experience inside MET and OneSchool Global.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4373s)

It was MET, but like merging to OneSchool. So kind of, yeah, let's sort of mean like same, same thing, different name, just a name change.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4380s)

A name change.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4381s)

Yeah, and the reason why I want to go through these is I do deal with quite a few teenagers and kids in there that don't have access to this stuff, and I just want you to see what the world is saying about OneSchool Global. I'm going to have links to these down below in something that you can open up. And I think it's super important that you guys go through these and read what the world thinks about OneSchool Global.

So this [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4411s) one is about Ben and his bullying, the harassment, everything that he went through. Yeah, maybe you can sum this up a little bit more, Ben.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4424s)

Sure. Basically, if you're not having a good time in OneSchool Global, you weren't alone. You're not alone in your experience. I left OneSchool Global in 2009\. I graduated the year of 2009, and I think I started 2003\.

I went to MET school Kellyville, and there was the last year before when I graduated, they then went to Sydney campus, which was the, yeah, the Sydney campus. But we did, it's not that we didn't have a lot to do with Sydney campus because we did our, you know, our certificates, like a lot of things with them, in particular because I did science in year 11 and 12, our classes kind of joined up.

But it wasn't, it was, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4473s) was really challenging for somebody who is creative. I loved arts and I probably would have pursued arts or theatre and anything, anything creative. And that school stifled me from it. Like, I would be secretly, you know, borrowing books from, I don't want to reveal the teacher, but I'd be secretly getting things that weren't allowed.

I talk to teachers now that have left. They were like, "We knew that you were gay in there. We couldn't do anything about [it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4503s) Just like they knew that other kids were. And they were like, "We really worried because you, you struggled, but there was this barrier of being like, we couldn't do anything. Our hands were tied."

And I guess in the sense of like Tim's shared that you get, come to a point where it's like, "Okay, I need to help a kid that's really struggling, but they're just going to find me or, you know, move me on, and then it would just be the same case for the next person, the next teacher."

So it was [really,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4533s) yeah, the article I essentially just go through how difficult it was for me just to even grappling life and realizing that my life wasn't normal, because you thought it was to a point in the school, and then realizing that I was also struggling with my sexual identity, being, you know, realizing through high school that I was gay and dealing with that and having absolutely no resources or anybody to talk to.

And it's obviously something you don't bring up with your own family. There, there was no therapy, there was no, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4564s) was nothing. There was no, the idea of therapy wasn't even a thing for me. I thought therapy meant, you know, for when you have a hip operation, you go and get physical therapy. Like, I didn't realize that it just wasn't something that was taught. And nor was sexual education. So it's, yeah, it's, that's essentially what the article goes through.

To any kid listening in there, I've been out of a cult now coming up this April, nine years. And if I could say something to the [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4594s) little teenage boy that I was in high school that was bullied every hour within every day of his life at that school, and then at church, to know that I would be in a place today of pursuing a career that I could only have ever dreamed of, surrounded by the people I could have only, that loved me, that I could only have ever dreamed of.

And to have the peace that I have in doing that, I used to think suicide was a positive alternative to the life that I was in, only [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4624s) I hadn't experienced life out here. And now, nine years out, I can honestly say from a place of peace that I have a windowsill here of my favorite fiction books. Like, it's to know that I don't have to dig a hole in my mattress to hide a book from my dad.

Like, it's, it's, it's so hard to live a life now so fully and freely and peacefully because you know, you get the Brethren rhetoric and I often remember used to hear, "Oh, but they can't be happy." [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4655s) so unrealistic to say that somebody is either happy all the time or sad all the time. I was sad all the time. Now I'm happy and sad and more importantly, I'm at peace. So I just, yeah. To any kid in there that is struggling, because I know I'm talking to a couple at the moment and I know they really struggle with their mental health, and I get that.

But if you can look at, if it can at all be some sort of light at the end of the tunnel to know that time will pass and before long you'll be adult enough, old enough to make your own decisions, stand up [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4685s) what is a horrible circumstance and make a life that is wholly your own.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4690s)

Yeah, I want to point out something that the spokesperson said in this article. When asked about the approval process for therapy, the spokesperson said that no student has been declined confidential counseling support where they have requested it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4703s)

Well, that's true in my case because you weren't even offered it. See what I mean? It's contemporary, creative.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4710s)

I always want a Maury Povich button that says, "And that was proved to be a lie."

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4716s)

There, the time that article was published, that was just as they were starting to roll out the new approval process for mental health support within the school. And so previous to that, there was just a, it'd be referred from the principal. I think she goes into it somewhere else in the articles there, about the fact that it needs to be now approved by, I think, about 10 people, including Brethren people.

And so when he's, yeah, [again,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4746s) it's that mental gymnastics of, "No, we've never denied a kid who's asked for it," but also now we're putting in this new system that's going to make it a lot harder to get approved. And also, personally, I know of multiple cases where the referrals didn't go anywhere. The referrals got put through and sat on a desk and didn't get through to the person who needed to see them. And so they weren't denied, they just weren't processed. Yeah, it's all, yeah, it's all what is it, doublespeak from, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4775s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4777s)

So I presume George Orwell's books were not in the 100 approved volumes.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4784s)

Well, *Animal Farm*, *Animal Farm* was at the school when I was there, but it is not in the new list, no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4790s)

I bet. Yeah, I guess it's not.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4792s)

I was going to say I read *Animal Farm*. I don't know what, *Animal Farm* was one of the books that I was like, "Hello?" Yeah, yeah. What are we reading?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4800s)

Yeah, it's that, that meme of, "Do you think we're the baddies?" Like, it's... Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4809s)

Yeah. So the second article goes on and it's the title is, "Why Guardian Australia is investigating the Exclusive Brethren school." And I want to stop here at Sarah calling this the “Exclusive Brethren” school. So for all of the new spokespersons that are coming out saying that they were never called the Exclusive Brethren? Well, here is a ton of information that proves you were once called Exclusive Brethren.

This is a pamphlet [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4839s) used to hand out that's titled, "The Truth About the Exclusive Brethren," that clearly states who they are and that they call themselves the Exclusive Brethren. We have clips in here from history teachings, tons of articles, encyclopedias, and a screenshot here too of their own website that they had before they rebranded this website to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And the website was [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4870s) [www.theexclusivebrethren.com](https://www.theexclusivebrethren.com).

The complete irony of all of this and them denying ever being called the Exclusive Brethren is this written word by their man of God himself, Bruce D. Hales, titled, "Living Our Beliefs: The Current Way of Life of the Exclusive Brethren." So I rest my case of proving [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4900s) further, unless Lloyd Grimshaw needs me to remind him over and over of everything that we have collected that they did once call themselves the Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4910s)

And you are still called that. It's, you might not identify as that now, but that's fine. But that was our experience as Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4919s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4922s)

Really interesting, interesting read on the finances, how they are one of the highest funded schools in Australia, I think, or one of, they've got insane amounts of government funds, and yet they, and members listening can vouch for this, they are also then asked to donate copious amounts of money to the school. Like there is, I remember we would have days, and the schools can't be that expensive to run. Like, they are funded like [incredible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4952s) amounts of money.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4954s)

Yeah. I mean, we've been over it on another podcast. The amount of money the Brethren collect, allegedly all for the schools, is way in excess of what they could possibly spend. And in fact, it's in excess of what they do spend, because a lot of the accounts are essentially public and their charities, which are there for spending the schools, are accumulating insane amounts of cash that they, they got nothing to spend on.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=4984s) yet they're still begging money off the government and they're still begging money off their members. I mean, Damian Hastie came up with a figure that globally, the Brethren charities, nearly all of which are school related, ostensibly, are sitting on over a billion dollars Australian of cash. Which would be enough to run the whole of OneSchool Global for more than four years.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5011s)

They certainly pick and choose what they'll spend it on too. So personal experience, just for some examples, I, in learning support, was looking into a text-to-speech reading program for a student because she had trouble with reading. And I found one. I did a fair bit of research, found one that was quite good and was going to be more interactive and more user-friendly for the kid.

It was about $80, and I was told, "Oh, no, we've already got the one that's on Microsoft Word. We don't need to pay for a second one." $80. They wouldn't fork over $80 for that. And then I also, we had other kids coming in for this year's round of students with needs.

We could see, like, looking ahead that we were going to need extra learning support staff just because of the amount of students who needed help and also the amount of students in high school who needed help with navigating the system and the way that they were doing it online and students weren't handling learning that way. And so we needed extra learning support as staff and yeah, it was telling me, "Oh no, we don't have the budget for any extra staff."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5085s)

I want to read something out of this article:

“Earlier this year, Hales declared that the devil is trying to get into our schools as he urged his followers not to take the OneSchool Global Network for granted. In a ministry message given by Hales in the U.S. in March, published in the SEC's so-called White Books, and seen by *The Guardian*, Hales says members should value the importance of impressions early in our lives.

"It will hold us, hold us against the power of the world. It will hold us against [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5115s) power of worldly persons," Hales said. "Our children in the main generally go to schools that we try and run. The devil is against them," Hales said, according to the ministry. "We have to be very watchful in regard of our schooling, take nothing for granted. As soon as we take something for granted, the devil has already got a hold."”

This part just breaks my heart because I think of all of those children that need help and he is not allowing them to get this help. I don't think Bruce Hales realizes that he [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5146s) the devil inside his own system.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5147s)

Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5150s)

And then the next article that went out is all about the surveillance at the Exclusive Brethren-linked schools and it goes on about this is their Streamline 3, is it? It goes on to say;

“…all students, staff, and parents are told their school devices are monitored and the OneSchool Global network says any surveillance strictly abides by the Privacy Act and all other Australian law.”

So this is something, Tim, you've already talked about with not being able to access certain things.  
“OneSchool Global says there is no involvement from [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5180s) church in their surveillance procedures, but this is disputed by former staff and students. Official school documents are also understood to refer repeatedly to the involvement of local community pastoral support.”

 I wanted to throw this over to you, Tim, and give your, the truth about that one sentence there.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5202s)

Yeah, again, I think they're just being so flippant. They're just gaslighting so much in terms of the church not being involved. Are they trying to say the church isn't involved, it's the parents who are involved, but they are also under the employ of the school who is the church? It's just all this roundabout way of getting around things.

There's Streamline, but they also employ device monitors, so people who are employed by the school to go through student search histories and watch what the students are doing on their laptops, search for words of concern, that sort of thing. They're members of the community, they're parents, they're members of the church, and they are employed to watch what the kids are doing.

And it just opens up this minefield of access and potential [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5260s) harm to the kids. Like, that it said that they have to sign confidentiality agreements and whatever else. But if there's somebody in there who has questionable, what would you say, ulterior motives? If they were to find a kid looking at something they shouldn't be, say they found out a kid was, yeah, gay or something like that, and from what they've been searching, what if they then approach the kid themselves and say, "Hey, I know this about you now."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5289s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5291s)

But it just opens up this real minefield of access to these children from people who aren't actually in the school, who aren't actually teachers. And they have this insight and this overview of what the kids are doing. It's just really dangerous.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5308s)

I mean, we should say here, for people who are not familiar with the system, that when they talk about pastoral care and pastoral support, these are not people that have had any training whatsoever in pastoral care or child psychology or working with young people. The church doesn't endorse any of that at all. These are just members of the congregation. That's the only qualification they have to offer pastoral care.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5338s)

And they're the people the teachers are expected to defer to to support the kids in those areas.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5344s)

Exactly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5345s)

I think we can vouch for the fact the higher they are up, the more responsibility, like something like this, they would be giving. Like, I knew of somebody that used to have to approve of websites and things like that. Meanwhile, he was grooming and, you know, displaying predatory behavior to young girls, which obviously goes hand in hand with being given ultimate access confined to a community where you have unlimited access to innocent people.

And then also a community that is so concerned with their own reputation that they will hide predators, rapists, potential murderers even, to protect their image. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5393s) as former members, we know that the higher they are up there, the more they know, the more likely they are of that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5404s)

I want to read something out from this article.

"Each week, these monitors charged with helping to review and apply IT policies are required to report to the school the internet activity of each student and any inappropriate search terms or content. They are expected to regularly report their findings to the local church leadership. The monitors are also expected to ensure that parents access their child's email account by having it installed on their own devices.

The monitors are required to report to the school weekly [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5435s) any parents who are not accessing the Streamline 3 portal to check on their child's internet use. Parents say they are sent a weekly summary of their children's internet use, are then required to log on to the portal to access the full computer activity of their child, including their email activity and any files they have accessed or created each week."

And we have had parents come on here. Andrea Becker, for one, who left just recently, talked about she actually did this. So this isn't false [information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5465s) that was given to *The Guardian*. We've had people come on the podcast that have confirmed parents doing this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5471s)

And you can see it's a whole hierarchy of control because the parents are being forced to control the kids, but then the higher church authority is at the same time monitoring the parents. So it's a very dystopian sort of Orwellian system of surveillance. It was not just the school kids who are being monitored. There's enough trouble with them surveilling former members. I mean, we can all witness to that with being chased by private investigators all around the [place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5501s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5503s)

Yeah. And then I wanted to just really quickly touch on the use of their CCTV cameras in their campuses. Did you, were you, did you recognize this, Tim? Like, did you have CCTV cameras on your campus?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5515s)

Yeah, everywhere. Every room, every room around the school, playground areas, everywhere.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5523s)

And which is not unusual for schools, right? But one of the things that I think stood out for me, and I don't know if this is your school, Tim, so I'd be interested to know, a teacher told me that they would have a community member who sat there monitoring all day anything that happened.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5543s)

Yeah, so it was definitely everywhere and it was pretty intimidating, really, as a teacher, knowing that the people who were in charge of the community side of things were always watching, apparently. I was told there was a roster of parents or community members who were watching cameras at all times.

There was a couple of times where a principal had come in and found students had phones or something like that, and that because of a tip-off from the cameras and the parents or [somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5573s) had called the school and said, "Hey, this kid's got their phone out in the learning center." They could see it on the cameras, and so the principal would then come and take the phone off the kid. Like, that degree of constant surveillance, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5586s)

And so as a teacher, your own computer was also monitored as well as the students' computers being monitored, is that right?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5596s)

We were told it wasn't. We were told that Streamline or whatever was said it wasn't set up that way. But then, yeah, one day a teacher found their own name on a list that could be added to Streamline Monitoring. Like, or what was it? I can't think of the name of the program now.

Yeah. And so we were told that that wasn't set up on staff laptops so that staff weren't able to be watched. But then, yeah, one of those teachers found their own name on a list that could be added to a watch list. So, yeah. Nobody was ever really sure. Like at my campus, nobody was ever really sure where the limits were.

Like, we asked one of the, I forget what the title was, district principals, I think his title was for New South Wales, about the cameras. And one of the teachers said, "Oh, but it doesn't have microphones, do they?" And [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5644s) sort of just looked around and made a face. And like, which would be, as far as I've looked into, would be illegal to monitor in New South Wales, at least to record audio as well as video without consent. But nobody actually knew whether they were recording video. So it was just this intimidation of having that thing always there, watching, not knowing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5667s)

Big brother.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5668s)

Yeah.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5669s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5669s)

Yeah, I was going to say, Richard, that a few teachers that have left have said they've really struggled after, since leaving, to have the whole, to get over the Big Brother mindset. Like, they would walk down the street and be like, "Oh, hang on, no, I can go out today in my gym outfit. I don't care if I meet Brethren," whereas before they were very afraid to even be themselves outside of it, outside of that work environment, which is such a toxic, unhealthy.

If any other job, if you had [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5699s) other job like that, you would, or heard of any other your family members having a job like that, you would say, "Oh, that's such a toxic work environment. Why would you work there?" So as a teacher working there, if you're listening, it's like, hold up the mirror.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5711s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5713s)

Was the program called Dino?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5715s)

Yeah, that's it, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5717s)

Yeah, that's the other program. So they have Streamline 3, and then this other thing is called Dino.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5723s)

Yeah, which can be used like by teachers to watch the laptops of a class. So you can look at all the screens of all the students and see what they're doing. In theory is to make sure they're on the task and they're doing the work. But yeah, it can also be used to watch whatever they're looking at on their laptops. And yeah, as I said, we were told that teachers weren't set up on that system to be watched, but then a teacher did find his name on there, able to be added to a class. So somehow it was. And again, like Streamline [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5753s) those sort of things and internet access, like, I never did anything on my work laptop in terms of researching the Brethren or anything like that because, yeah, it would probably flag somewhere.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5767s)

Yeah, but I mean, it all goes through their own servers anyway, so even if they didn't have it set up, they could probably get into the back end of the system and see what was being searched. So yeah, they're extremely good at surveillance and they've got a long history of surveillance. I mean, because as I said, it first came up because they were putting intensive surveillance on former members, but you know, this is an old trick of theirs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5796s)

The next article goes into the wealth of the schools. And I'm actually, Ben, I think that you probably could explain this better because you have had so much to do with the teachers and stuff. And that absurdity of how they get their government grants. And they claim to be in, what is it? They claim to be in the disadvantage.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5821s)

It's actually at an educational disadvantage, which from my understanding is to us, a disadvantaged school, you would think came from a low socioeconomic, like from a school that had in the outreaches of Australia where there might be communities of First Nations people or there might be community, like in areas that have less money, essentially. That's what you would think.

So with OneSchool Global, however, or with, [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5851s) actually the reality of being in a disadvantaged school, I can't remember the figures and numbers, I'd have to reread this article to get it exact, but essentially the Brethren, and I know from a former staff member, Brethren ex-member that used to work at OneSchool, they would train, teach parents to enroll their students.

And when you had to say what your job was, obviously the women didn't work, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5881s) they would downplay the male's role. So essentially, being in a low socioeconomic school, it's based on education of the parents. And the irony is that you aren't allowed to go to university, so therefore you don't have an education. So you can draw up the system and say, "Well, we are a disadvantaged school because we don't have, our students' parents aren't, don't have education, like have an education or aren't educated."

Therefore, they can obviously get more money [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5911s) more funding because they are not educated, but they don't offer it. Does that make sense?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5918s)

Yeah.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5919s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5920s)

So, yeah.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5921s)

They found the loophole.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5923s)

Yeah, they found that, yeah, essentially found the loophole, which as we know, when it comes to money, the Brethren are great at finding loopholes.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5931s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5931s)

And so that downplay, enroll students and downplay. But if you pulled apart Brethren wages, they would be much higher and equivalent to some of the first, the most, you know, King's School or even more like other schools that were, you know, number one in terms of income, in terms of wealth. The Brethren collectively would be in that 1%. It's just absolutely crazy, that whole, you know, system.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5961s)

So to sum it up, because they don't allow women to work, it can kind of look as if, well, most of the women in the community or the mothers in the community are unemployed. And it also appears that, like, they've got a horrifically low rate of university education. In fact, none of the parents have got a university education, which from the government standpoint makes it look like some very low-income community where there would take a low socioeconomic school.

[Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=5991s) lower education. Well, in fact, it's exactly the opposite. It's the church is forbidding the women to work and the church is forbidding the parents to go to university. But they're all insanely rich.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6004s)

Yeah. Here, I want to read this out of this article. Here's, again, another lie from a spokesperson. "We don't control, nor could not, and would not seek to influence the reported occupations and levels of education of parents in our school community," the spokesperson said.

So, to those insiders that we're talking to right now that want to go and take a degree, you can go do it. They don't control that. You get to go do it. After we put this out, hopefully next week, and then you guys can wake up the next morning and everybody can apply [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6034s) their university degree that you've all been stifled away and thought you weren't allowed to. Well, you are allowed to.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6041s)

That's the thing with these payments. They're meant to close that gap between that lack of, that disadvantage in education. It's meant to close that gap and help schools to support these students to then be able to progress to university. But then, as I said before, when we look at it, they're not going to spend that money on learning support. They're not going to spend that money on extra resources to support the kids to be able to make that leap where their parents, in theory, weren't able to previously.

[It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6072s) not, that's not it though. It's, they're not allowed to do it. And yeah, again, it's like that, like you said before, when I first started there, in my head, I was like, "Well, look at the cars they're driving, look at the, like, they're all fancy, they've all got all this wealth. They must be happy, they must be doing well. It can't be that bad." But even this sort of highlights, well, yeah, they might have a lot of money, but they're not educated, they're not necessarily [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6102s) well holistically. It's that sort of thing again where, yeah, money doesn't mean that everything's okay. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6111s)

And I think that's a really important note that Tim's just mentioned for parents that are listening to this podcast.

Like, I know my parents would just say, "Well, they need more money for the school." And if you asked why, "Well, you don't ask why. They just need more money." And if you broke it down and if you sat there with all the figures which are available, especially in this article, you would begin to question, "Well, where is the money going?"

And I don't think, you know, I think we've done, I think you guys have done a few podcasts on where the money essentially goes. And whether you like to believe it or not or put it down to, you know, just [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6149s) one thing with money, it's traceable. So when you're promised, I've heard that in recent seminars they've promised cheaper rates for schooling and, in fact, it's been the opposite. They've gone up. Yeah, school things have gone up. The school doesn't need that much money. It doesn't have that many kids. So the question is, where is the money going?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6171s)

Exactly, yeah. I want to read something out here at the very end of this article.

"Our children are not prevented from attending university, with some amongst our flock choosing to study at university online." Again, I need my Maury Povich button that says, "And that is a lie," because it is a lie.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6193s)

Well, as a former student, that is a lie. And you are encouraged to take on a tertiary education study at a TAFE online, but it's not what you want to do. I had a literal argument with my old boss because I didn't want to do accounting and he wanted me to do a certificate for an accounting, which I had to do. I made a deal with him that I would do it in case, in the case that he would buy me an interior design course.

That was the only way you could do what you wanted to [do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6223s) And it was a very rare exception because he was like, "I don't want you to do this because you'll end up leaving the Brethren." And look, at least he was right about one thing. But the thing is, they do study, they do have, they do go on to study, but it's just a certificate for TAFE course. It's not anything, and it's within whatever guidelines they want, which is whether it's going to be beneficial to their businesses. So you couldn't be like, "Well, I want to study psychology." You couldn't do [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6253s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6253s)

No, and the funny thing is, is when you go on to the PBCC members' LinkedIn profiles and they all have this like, you know, "Studied whatever, wherever at this university and that university." It's such, it's such bullshit because it's not true. So like, when you're, when you're looking and scrolling through and you know, trying to figure out where these people got their university educations from, they didn't go to these universities and do like a four-year degree on something that doesn't happen inside there. So again, they found another loophole [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6283s) you know, throwing sloppy university…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6286s)

On LinkedIn. They all have like Cambridge University badge or Harvard, and it's just a complete lie. They never went to Cambridge. Anybody can put that up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6296s)

Yeah, I went to Harvard too, in my dream state. Okay, so then another one, this is her, this is the fifth article she put out. It's called, "Exclusive Brethren students exposed only to material that conforms to church ethos, former teachers claim." Teachers claim. Tim went into this already. I'm not going to go through this whole article. I'll have it linked down below. You're welcome to read it. Tim gave a very, very good preview of what he went through with what was allowed, what wasn't allowed.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6329s)

It's gotten more strict since this article.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6330s)

So I'm going to go on to read something out of this article. It says, "Our school does not stop children going to public libraries or art galleries. If parents want to take their kids there, of course they can, and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. In addition…" I'm trying not to laugh while I read this, you guys, "...as part of excursion programs, of course, our students have visited venues that have libraries, galleries, and a whole range of other exhibitions."

So I'm going to put up a news article here of when they [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6361s) go to a museum and they had half of it censored and blocked out because they couldn't see it.

### [**CBC News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6366s)

“This private school says its staff uphold values of integrity, respect, and compassion. But the Stirling North Stonewall School went to federal court in 2020 to prevent the public from learning about something it wanted kept secret. Stirling asked the Canadian Museum for Human Rights not to show any LGBT material while grades 7 to 12 students toured the building in 2018\.

By the time the case got to court, the schools were operating under the [OneSchool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6396s) Global banner. The Plymouth Brethren Church set up that organization. The Plymouth Brethren has historically tried to stay out of the public eye a great deal. The school's fight to keep their identities a secret is outlined in more than 3,000 pages of court documents. The museum was going to release the names of the schools in response to an access to information request filed by the CDC. But the schools got a federal court order preventing the museum from doing that until [now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6426s)”

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6427s)

Embarrassment is not an exception under any Access Act.

### [**CBC News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6432s)

“Federal Justice Catherine Kane didn't agree the school would suffer a financial loss if the records were released. But she did rule the identities of the staff members who requested the tours should be redacted. Museum records show the following schools asked for censored tours so a same-sex marriage display with photos of gay couples wouldn't be shown and everything from LGBT rights to abortion wouldn't be talked about.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6459s)

We're upset about what has happened and I think more needs to be done to address the harm that was caused.

### [**CBC News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6471s)

“EGALE Canada says the harm caused by the censored tours is still raw. The non-profit advocates for LGBT rights. It's calling on the museum to set up an exhibit about its own failure.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6484s)

It's something that needs to be told. It's a story that's very significant.

### [**CBC News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6488s)

“The museum says it's happy the Judicial Review upheld its decision to release the records. It says it's part of an effort to be transparent about a very dark chapter in its past, noting it no longer lets schools request censored tours, has increased diversity in staff, and is creating new LGBT content. OneSchool Global says the incident is one the school regrets and has learned from. Austin Grabish, CBC News, [Winnipeg.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6519s)”

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6521s)

True to a point, because yes, I did go to libraries as a kid with my mom, but she would sit there and be like, "You get that May Gibbs book out and that's all you're getting for homework." You know, like you, there's no wandering off to another aisle to peruse books to read. Like, yes, they do, they tell the truth to that much, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6541s)

And I mean, we've heard from Tim today saying that the books have gone down to just 100 books. So again, this has even gotten stricter since this article has come out.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6550s)

From what I can gather, it's the, the coercive control side of it, and it's the mentality of, "Oh no, we're the school, we don't tell you you can't go to the library with your kids." But within the, I mean, I'm not, obviously, I've never been part of the PBCC, but the mentality is the parents know that they're not meant to do that because the church has indoctrinated them to know that. And so the school can come out and say, "Oh no, we've never said you can't go to the library." It's just understood. It's coercive control of...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6576s)

Exactly. We didn't know that.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6577s)

That's the, that's what we do. We don't do that. But the school's never said that. So why would you suggest we say that? 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6584s)

I mean, I get the impression there's two levels of information. There's what they'll put in writing, which is on their nice curriculum. And then when you go to work for them, there's a whole range of things that they will tell you verbally, but they don't dare to actually put in print in case it gets leaked. Is that right?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6602s)

Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah, it's, as I was saying, like, we never discussed university with the kids because they don't go there. It's not in writing, it's not the school policy in writing, but that's, the teachers know not to say that. And you're always walking on eggshells to know not to say the wrong thing. Like, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6621s)

I want to read something here. It says, "While core curricular subjects are always taught, not every additional subject is available at every school, and not every school has the same subjects available. The subjects available for study are driven by the curriculum requirements, demand from students, and available teacher expertise, among other factors," he said. "Many of the school students successively undertook high-level art, sciences, and social studies."

Well, I have to say, Ben talks to a lot of teachers. We've [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6651s) teachers that have come on here. I mean, Tim, you've explained to you, to us how, you know, they just don't, if they don't have, they don't want to offer a certain thing, they don't offer it, right? It's not necessarily that that teacher, I mean, you talked about an art teacher that wasn't allowed to teach art, right? So again, they are misconstruing and gaslighting how they're presenting what they do at their, at their school.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6674s)

Yeah, that "among other factors" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6678s)

Yeah. The sad reality is they think they're pulling it off, but it's not happening. Like, it's not...

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6684s)

The whole thing is just them saying, "No, fake news." Like, it's that mentality of, "No, fake news. We can't, that's not true." Yeah, but not, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6693s)

And so I'm going to read this last paragraph in this, in this article for all the OSG teachers that are applying there. And I mean, we now know they've got, they're looking for teachers everywhere. It's on the radios, they're showing up in places that they've never shown up in before because we know they're desperate, desperate for OSG teachers.

So I want to read this out to you. 

"The devil is trying to get into our schools. He's relentless. We need to look through the rank and file of who we've got teaching our children to make sure they're [true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6723s) to our values." 

And I mean, this is how so many teachers get disappeared and go missing overnight is because they don't line with their values and boom, you're gone, you're out of there. And then they wonder why they have no teachers teaching their kids is because, you know, they're shooting them out the door as fast as they're coming in.

Okay, so the last article she wrote, the title is called, "Lucrative Building Contracts for Exclusive Brethren Schools Awarded to Businesses Run by Church Members."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6749s)

Yeah, so this is, this is basically money laundering through OneSchool Global. It's a major pathway for money laundering. And the way it works is that the school gives extremely overpriced contracts to Brethren businesses for building and renovating and supplying the schools.

And, you know, we've got a whole podcast where a former school trustee exposed how a brother in business, in [fact,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6779s) run by Gareth Hales, son of the Man of God, Bruce Hales, was supplying stuff to a major school renovation and simply marking it up by three times. So if the carpet costs $10,000, he sold it to the school for $30,000.

And of course, add into that factor that the schools are being largely funded by the government, and you're basically taking two money streams. You're taking money from the [government.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6809s) You're taking charitably donated tax-receipted funds from the Brethren. You're running it through these commercial contracts for the school, and it's ending up in the pockets of Bruce D. Hales and his friends and family. And this is happening all around the world, particularly at the moment. And it's one of the reasons that the schools have always got the latest shiny new buildings and equipment and technology is because the people who control the whole system are making a huge profit on all [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6840s) building and technology.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6841s)

They're doing at the moment, they're doing what they're calling the Campus Modernization Project around Australia, which is redoing all of the classrooms, or not all of them, but the majority of classrooms in schools to be up to their modern standards. If you were to look at them, there's completely nothing wrong with them. There's nothing wrong with these.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6860s)

They're mostly brand new. They're mostly only built in the last 10 years.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6863s)

And they're tearing it down and rebuilding them. Yeah. But yeah, I'm sure if you were to trace the money with the companies that get these contracts to do the modernization, it's not going very far, I don't think.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6876s)

No, that doesn't go very far outside Sydney, New South Wales.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6880s)

So it goes on in this article to say, "OSG does not direct our schools to use any provider for the contract work they undertake, and we do expect that schools will always seek to obtain the best value for money in any contracts." Well, as long as it's filling the Hales' pockets, that's the best value for money.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6898s)

Yeah, keep it in the system. Keep it all in the family is how it works, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6904s)

One of the things that I wanted to ask you is because I know the kids really, if they do have devices that they can watch this on, and we try and make it as readily available in all of its form for anybody to access this, if there was one of your students that watched this, what would you want to say to those students that you weren't able to help the way that you wanted to help?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6928s)

That the... you make me emotional.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGyodryYhHRg%26t%3D6934s)

I know, well, we can both cry together.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6936s)

There is, yeah, there is so much more opportunity and so much more life out there for any of the kids who want to do more. If you feel like you're trapped, then there is always options. There's always people who are going to help you. There's always support available outside of that system.

And just because you feel like you're stuck at the moment and you can't go anywhere further than you feel like you're destined to, that's not the case. There's, there's so much [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6966s) that you can do and you're able to do. You're only limited by what's around you at the moment, basically. And there is definitely ways to get out of that, that system. And you can be, basically, yeah, it's cliche, but yeah, you can be what you want to be when you're able to, basically. Yeah. Don't give up. Basically, don't give up. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=6990s)

And what would you say to teachers that are stuck inside the OSG system, want to leave, and believe that they can't?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7001s)

Yeah, I guess it is. It's such a hard thing to grapple with in terms of your own, your own life that you've set up, your well-being, your career. But there are other, again, there's, there's other careers out there. Just think long and hard about if you are doing what you set out to do.

If you're a teacher and you've been trained as a teacher and you want to teach kids and help kids and support kids, do you feel like you're actually doing that in the job you're in at the moment at OneSchool? Or do you think that you're sort of just agreeing with what they're [asking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7038s) you to do because it feels like that's all you can do? Yeah, you should think about why you took the job and why you became a teacher, I think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7047s)

Yeah. And in your opinion, like, what do you think needs to happen in order to be able to change the a system like what OneSchool Global has?

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7065s)

Yeah, I'm not sure. It's going to be, hopefully, I'm hoping that this, the New South Wales at least, is up for accreditation with NESA this year. Yeah. So I'm really hoping they go through and have a good look at what's in place there and look at ways to, to change some of these things because what's there at the moment isn't what's best for the kids.

And the focus at the schools isn't on the kids and their well-being and educating them, being a school to provide [education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7095s) and make kids ready for life, as their motto is. What is it? "Developing life-ready students" or something. But they're developing kids who are ready for the life that they want them to have. They really need to, yeah, it needs the whole system needs to be overturned in terms of what's actually, it doesn't seem like it's a school. It seems like it's a cog in the system, basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7123s)

Yeah. Well, I am so grateful, Tim, that you were brave enough to come on here, come on here as yourself and expose what you need to expose for your own mental health and and being able to come to terms with what you were in and what you left. I agree that we need to find a way to give choice back to children and this needs to be taken seriously. This is, these are children's lives we're dealing with and I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7153s) that their innocence and their sense of choice needs to be handed back to them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7160s)

Basically, right. Yeah, thanks Tim. As a former kid, like, thank you so much. You were the light and I no doubt so many kids' lives and then coming forward and stepping up, making history, essentially. I just know in years to come, you'll have somebody reach out and like I have to former teachers saying, "Just want you to know there was a point in my life where I didn't know which way to turn and you were that beacon." So yeah, I know that will happen. So thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7189s)

Yeah, I know that this will reach hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of kids. I know it will.

### [**Tim B**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7194s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, as I said, I think I've, I've reached the point where I just felt like I'd done everything I could to help them from inside. And as much as it hurt to leave and to feel like I'm leaving them to that without a person there to be that, I couldn't do anymore without, yeah, without leaving it, trying to do something like this. So, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyodryYhHRg&t=7214s)

Exactly. Well, thank you all. Thanks, Ben. Thank you, Richard, for joining us. And until next time, everyone, much love to you all. Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
