## Summary

The Palmy Party was an event like no other – was this just a dying convulsion of Bruce’s alcohol pickled brain, or was there some cold hard reasoning behind the bizarre and hugely costly fling, set on with no more than 24 hours notice, in the sleepy New Zealand city of Palmerston North?
Schools and businesses closed at the snap of a fat finger, 8000 brethren willingly or otherwise converged on this obscure spot by plane coach car or prison van, were fed on the best rib-eye steak, drowned their pain with top shelf spirits, while serenaded  by country and western ballads, all in the Holy Precincts of the Meeting Hall and all for what………?
Journalist and author Craig Hoyle and Olive-leaf network founder Lindy Jacomb take us deep into the world of New Zealand PBCC politics, from the 1860s forwards to today, and reveal a rebellious and independent streak that has ever been a thorn in the side of the so called “Great Men” of the Plymouth or Exclusive Brethren. With over 8000 members and many highly successful businesses, the PB Kiwis have considerable soft power within the “ecosystem” – yet they have never produced a universal leader.
Is the harsh and increasingly eccentric reign of brash Australian Bruce D Hales going to be the last straw for the beautiful islands of Aotearoa? Are they preparing to throw off the chains of Hales and go their own sweet way? Was the Palmy Party a desperate, last-ditch attempt to woo them back into Bruce’s sweaty embrace?
Listen up, dear friends, and decide for yourself!

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=10s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl and we are joined by Richard and Carman and our special guests from New Zealand, Craig Hoyle and Lindy Jacomb. We are here today discussing a very hot topic that most ex-members have been reading about on the Facebook pages and social media regarding Palmerston fellowship meetings or three-day meetings. We're not really sure what we're going to be calling them right now.

And Craig Hoyle, who is a [journalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=40s) in New Zealand, wrote a couple of pieces. We're just going to open up the floor to get into this subject that everybody's been emailing and messaging us about to get into a discussion over. So I'm going to hand it over to you, Craig. And if you can just inform our listeners and viewers on what this hot topic was.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=61s)

Thanks, Cheryl. Yes, so I come at this as a former member and also as a journalist. I work at the Sunday Star Times here in New Zealand, and the Sunday Star Times has a long history of following what's happening in the Exclusive Brethren church, going back more than 20 years. And so this is the kind of thing, absolutely, that we would be keeping an eye on.

It's quite a big event for New Zealand when you have 8,000 people suddenly dropping [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=91s) to travel to a small city, everybody notices. And so we're getting emails from members of the public, we're getting emails from people who work in Brethren businesses, the teachers at the schools, everyone wanting to know what's going on. Why are there so many Brethren at the airports? Why are there so many Brethren on the roads? Why are all the buses in town blocked out by Brethren?

And so we started plugging away and looking into this, and it quickly became apparent that there were fellowship meetings in Palmerston North that had been called at the [absolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=121s) last minute. When I say last minute, the first fellowship meeting was on Wednesday, and a lot of Brethren only found out on Tuesday. And you can imagine the impact of that, it's chaos.

So we had the Brethren schools were closed at very short notice and remained closed for the rest of the week. There were Brethren attending a trade show in Auckland who suddenly packed down their stalls and walked off the site, which of course leaves all the other non-Brethren businesses going, "Well, what on earth [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=151s) going on here?" I guess that has the world for these Brethren.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=155s)

I might have wondered if they'd had advanced notice of the rapture.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=158s)

But they went out horizontally, not vertically though.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=162s)

And the rapture may be here, but we've still got to pack our business down and take it with us. It's true.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=170s)

Craig, one question I had at first, that you might be able to answer better than me, is why Palmerston North? Like for those of you who aren't Kiwis, Palmerston North is not exactly a destination location. So do you want to fill in the listeners with why Palmerston North? It's about, you know, two hours from a bigger city.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=194s)

So Palmerston North is a city of less than a hundred thousand people, a couple of hours north of Wellington. It's sort of in the middle of the lower North Island, and I think there are a few reasons why they would use Palmerston North. First of all, it's relatively central in New Zealand, and it also has a decent-sized airport, but it's not one of the major metros like Auckland, Wellington, or Christchurch. And so when they organize their charter flights and their private jets, they're not having to do a lot of jostling with [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=224s) flights on the tarmac.

I wonder if that's a reason. It's also within bus driving distance for all the meetings, you know, Howard and New Plymouth, Hastings, Gisborne, Napier, and the Wellington area. And the other thing is that Palmerston has one of the biggest, newest meeting rooms in New Zealand, finished in 2020 with all the mod cons. They spent $17 million on this hall.

And that's kind of built to what they would now consider to be the gold standard for a meeting room compound, I would call it because it includes the hall and the school and the campus and all of these other different things. And so yes, this is it. It's a large, very large church with all the seating in the aisles and floors. There's capacity for 3,200 people, and then [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=283s) you start putting marquees up in the yard, you can fit another 500 people. And so it's one of the few halls in New Zealand that's big enough to cycle every single Brethren member in the country through within a couple of days.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=296s)

And so, sorry, did you say 3,000 people? Is that into the fixed seats or is that, you know, the way they also then fill the aisles in the foyer with removable stacking seating? Is that 3,000 people the fixed seating or is that all the stackables as well?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=314s)

So that's the fixed seating, plus the stackables, plus filling up the foyers.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=320s)

Okay, so that would be what they would consider the maximum number of people that you could get into the hall itself before you start...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=322s)

That would be what they would consider the maximum number of people that you could get into the hall itself before you start.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=334s)

Right. And so again, just to think of the New Zealand context, is there about 7,000 Brethren or 8,000 Brethren?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=341s)

About 8,000.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=342s)

About 8,000 now. And so you're saying that they weren't actually all there at one time, but that they were probably cycled through so that they each had a meeting with Bruce? Is that what you're saying?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=353s)

There would have been two different occasions. So there was a Wednesday fellowship meeting and a Friday fellowship meeting, and everyone in New Zealand over the age of five was expected to attend at least one of those meetings unless they were elderly or pregnant or there was some other reason why they couldn't travel.

So we saw in Auckland, for instance, they opened up the main hall in Auckland on Coronation Road, which is just around the corner from where I live actually. And I just happened to be filling up at the petrol station next door and saw the hall was opened on a Wednesday afternoon. I was like, this is highly unusual. And it turned out that they were holding a Zoom version of the Palmerston North meeting in the Auckland hall so that anyone who couldn't travel could go there to watch Bruce Hales.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=403s)

Oh.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=404s)

Wow, coming to a theater near you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=412s)

And the interesting part is my question was, would they play that in real-time or would they play it back after? And they actually played it in real-time. So they were watching what was happening in Palmerston as it was happening. Right, right.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=428s)

Yeah, but this is not, this is not sort of like a rugby game with video camera antics and replays of the best lines and that sort of thing, is it? You know, just sort of a fixed video of the great man himself? Is it something like that?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=445s)

Could you imagine at a fellowship meeting if they did what they do at the rugby and they did audience cutaways so you could see people's reactions?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=453s)

Yeah, and the cheerleaders of course, yeah, the cheerleaders.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=458s)

I love it. So what do we assume or speculate that this was called for, so fast and to New Zealand specifically?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=473s)

Yeah, so interesting situation with New Zealand. We have been leaked various documents, like on the Brethren ministry, and there was also the letter that was circulated recently about Bruce Hales being unhappy with what's happening in New Zealand. And of course, this has long, long been the case for the Exclusive Brethren. New Zealand has always been seen as a bit of an outlier.

If you go right back to when the Brethren movement started here, as early as the 1870s, you had J.N. [Darby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=503s) and J.B. Wigram raising concerns about the way the Brethren behaved in New Zealand. They didn't think they were up to what they considered to be the Brethren standard. And we've seen that pattern continuing all the way through. The same thing happened in the 1950s when JTJr. tried to get involved in Auckland matters and Auckland basically told them to stuff off.

And so this is not a new problem for world leaders of the Exclusive Brethren. [They've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=533s) always struggled to keep New Zealand in line. And New Zealand as a power base for the Brethren has always been quite restive and quite rebellious in terms of not fully following the rules or not fully complying. And Bruce Hales has cycled through various different methods to try and deal with this. He's tried being nice, he's tried being mean, [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=563s) tried the sort of the 'poor me' line, saying none of the Brethren in New Zealand even believe in what I'm saying.

I remember when I was a teenager, this would have been relatively new into his leadership, it being said that Bruce has said that only one in three of the New Zealand Brethren actually believed in him and his ministry. And he would make these remarks publicly. And of course, at the time when you're in the Brethren, you very much see that as a black [mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=593s) and a warning that you need to buck up your act. But I think really what it shows is that the New Zealand Brethren by and large tend to be quite independent thinkers and they're not afraid to, perhaps not publicly, or perhaps certainly not in anything less than a discrete setting, but they're much more willing to challenge and question what the Man of God is saying.

And I look at someone like my great-aunt for instance, Lindy, who spent her whole life in the Brethren but never, ever agreed with them. And she said as much to me when I was leaving. And you wonder how many other people there are in the New Zealand Brethren who are living their lives like this, not saying anything publicly, but they [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=644s) agree with Bruce Hales, they don't want to follow him, but they're trapped in a set of circumstances that mean they don't really have much choice.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=651s)

I think that was even true if you go back to the 70s, and we always noticed when New Zealand Brethren came over. It was after diamonds were outlawed, and it was so much fun to watch the sisters that came from Palmerston North, was the one that we always looked at. They had the biggest diamonds on their hands. And of course, in North America, it had been said we couldn't have diamonds. So they were [rebellious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=682s) all the way back then.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=684s)

And then there was the story, remember the story of when J.H.Symington went to Palmerston North, the carport incident?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=694s)

No, I don't know that, tell us that. What did you say?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=699s)

He was, so Symington was in New Zealand, this would have been in the mid-70s, I forget the exact year, and there were fellowship meetings, I think it was in Palmerston North. And after the meeting, he was in the carport getting ready to leave and none of the local brethren lined up to talk to him as they normally would. And it became known as the carport incident, with all these questions about why none of the local brethren were interested in talking to their leaders.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=728s)

Oh, that's hilarious. That would be beyond offensive.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=733s)

How dare the people not wait for the breadcrumbs from the table.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=741s)

Not the people, the dogs, the dogs. Yeah. Is there a bit of a national tension between Australia and New Zealand in any case? Just in general, with Australia being the larger country, would it be particularly irksome for a New Zealander to take orders from Australia?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=761s)

Oh, absolutely. And this has been a long-standing kind of tension that's gone on for generations. And when you go back to the, I'm getting into my sort of obscure Brethren history here, but when you go back to the Jack Bishop matter in 1952, part of the reason that caused so much conflict in Auckland is because you had the Australian Brethren trying to interfere and tell the New Zealand Brethren how to do their business. And that spiraled [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=792s) ended up going all the way to JTJr. in New York.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=797s)

It led to a big walkout, didn't it, Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=803s)

Yes, so they argued about that for four years. And there was a funny story that often got told when I was younger, we're getting a bit off-topic here, that the Auckland matters dragged out between '52 and '56. And at one point, the elders in Sydney, and this was like pre the Hales brothers almost, but at one point the elders in Sydney decided they were going to go over to Auckland to the care meeting and sort them out once and for all.

And Dr. Martin, I think it was in Sydney at that point, took [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=838s) what was in the flying boat from Sydney to Auckland, and he had his big dossier of evidence to take the Auckland Brethren to task. And as he was boarding the flying boat in Sydney, he tripped and dropped the whole dossier into the harbour. And I remember when I was younger, older Brethren from Auckland, still, this is like 50 years later, still telling the story of how Dr. Martin tried to come and [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=868s) them what to do from Sydney and dropped his dossier into the harbour. And they thought it was funny.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=874s)

Yes, they did.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=881s)

I'm kind of warming to these Kiwis a little.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=885s)

Well, and even in the system days, it was a big deal because in the farming towns, you had these system guys coming in and trying to tell these farmers how they're supposed to do stuff. And I mean, farmers don't like to keep timesheets, that's the scariest waste of time ever, you know? And it was the big clash. Yeah, Rangiora. Yeah, the stories that used to come out of Rangiora were just amazing.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=912s)

Yeah, and I think the other thing that I was talking to Professor Peter Lineham about this last week, and he's had what, 50 years of experience researching the Brethren movement. I think he himself grew up in the Reading Brethren side. But he was saying that New Zealand as a power base in the Exclusive Brethren has never [fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=943s) exercised the power that it has relative to its numbers.

They've never had the world leaders in the way that other parts of the world have, which is surprising considering how many Brethren there are here. And I think a lot of the elect vessels that have come and gone have been very aware of that, but been very aware of how much sort of dormant power there is in the New Zealand Brethren and quite conscious of [keeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=973s) that in check.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=976s)

That's really interesting because you've just reminded me, didn't people think that David Bill was going to become the new world leader at one point? He was a Brethren man from further up north. And was that after J.S.H. died?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=989s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. There certainly was. But I mean, I think every part of the world thought that their guy was going to be the guy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=998s)

You know, I mean you...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1000s)

The North Americans thinking it was going to be Lloyd Paskewitz, and you had the West Australians thinking it was going to be one of the Fawkes, and that's just, you know, it's going to be their guy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1009s)

Yeah, good point. Yeah, and there's been a lot of discord though amongst the Brethren in New Zealand, and there's been people that have been leaving. There's been a lot of people leaving in New Zealand recently, hasn't there?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1021s)

Yeah, absolutely. And this is the thing, those of us who have spoken publicly about our experiences, we know that the Brethren, or Bruce Hales in particular, is insistent that we are opposed as members of evil. And what I notice is that every time my name goes out there as someone that the Brethren shouldn't talk to, there's an increase in the number of Brethren who do talk to me.

It goes around in circles a little bit. And I've found, you know, for all that Bruce Hales criticizes the media, and I remember him talking about the newspapers as Satan’s printing presses and so on, through the many years I've been a journalist now, there are far more Brethren willing to come forward and talk to journalists than you would think based on what Bruce Hales is saying.

And I think, you know, you go back to the rat poison incident, those [remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1081s) that Bruce Hales made about Lindy's brother, and you know, that all came to light because someone in the Brethren in New Zealand leaked it all to the Sunday Star Times, which is the newspaper I work at. So I think the Brethren here are very, very willing, and this is, it's not even necessarily people who want to leave the Brethren. It's just that they think the Brethren need a bit of course correction or that Bruce Hales needs to be pulled into line.

And there's people in the Brethren who don't intend to leave the Brethren [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1111s) are quite happy to pull their own strings to influence or exert what power they can over Bruce Hales. Because in the Brethren, they have no power to hold them to account, but if they start pulling the external strings, then some of their power does come back. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1130s)

And I mean, we have a, we had an insider who informed us that after Bruce got home from Palmerston, he changed the meeting times in Sydney. I just got word, I asked specifically if it was all of Australia, it's not. It was just Sydney and its immediate interchange area where they changed all their meetings. And they have no in-person meetings anymore, other than Sunday morning, which is not at 6 a.m. [anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1160s), it's at 8 a.m. And everything else is Zoom, recorded, or in your own home. That's the only meeting that they are going into in person for. I think it's important to talk about the way Bruce pushes and pulls with his leniency and rules and then tightens down and then lets go and then tightens down.

I firmly believe he does this to show people that he is the one in charge. And if we get down into what was happening inside Palmerston North, the meeting hall, and in their tents, there was a lot of partying going on inside there. And I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1206s) Carman, you have the actual number of how many thousands of dollars worth of alcohol was ordered for those two days.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1214s)

Yeah, we've been told, and we verified this with multiple sources, that they went through a hundred thousand dollars worth of booze, which comes from their internal supplier, Vendemia. But coming from bringing booze into a tent on the meeting room parking lot.

And personally, I found it really shocking. But if you really stop and think, they proclaim themselves to be a mainstream Christian church. And when I look around the county where I am, and I know this is North America, but I cannot think of a single mainstream or a single church of any kind, whether it's mainstream, whether it's Christian, whether it's un-Christian, whatever it is, I cannot think of a single church that would have a booze party in a tent [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1267s) of the meeting room or their church. It just...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1270s)

Well, you know one other church where they were all drinking was on the stage at Aberdeen in 1970\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1282s)

Oh, that's fascinating. My mind is exploding at that, Carman. I agree with you. I just think that's absolutely astonishing. I also, you know, when I was in there, people did not drink alcohol in the car park. I know that over the years there's been various... it has happened.

Like I remember people talking about years ago, I don't know exactly how long ago, but people talked about the car park, sorry, the boot, the car boot drinking sessions. And I think that was before they had breaks in people's homes. And instead, they would load the boots of their cars with alcohol and snacks. And in between maybe, yeah, the main meeting and the preaching or something, everyone would go to the car park, open their boots, and have like a car boot party.

So maybe this was a reinstatement of that, but like really endorsed from the top. [Or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1334s) yeah, like what have you guys, what have you heard about? Is this a new thing to be drinking in the church grounds with the church leadership endorsing and supplying the alcohol? And did people have to pay for that or was it all on the tab, on the house?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1349s)

Well, one thing that's really important to know, it was obviously pre-planned because it was ordered and delivered. And I'm being told there were signs in the car park and around the tent that said, "one drink per person."

However, the little cart that was rolling around was refilling and refilling at a rate far greater than one drink per person. And this is going on in a tent with children running through it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1380s)

I mean, what do they call one drink? Because I remember being told that anything less than a 50-50 scotch and coke was unspiritual.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1390s)

Right.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1391s)

Right, right. So I was going to say, if you take a hundred thousand and divide it by maybe seven thousand or so attendees, leaving out the children, it's something like fifteen dollars a head. How much alcohol do you get for fifteen dollars in New Zealand, Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1415s)

Buy a bottle of wine or a bottle of scotch? Yeah, if you're buying wholesale, then that would be maybe a bottle of wine.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1425s)

And was there food supplied with this as well?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1428s)

Yes, yes, it was fully catered. Very expensive steak. You know, it was long rows of tables covered with black cloths and food that was being served by all the sisters in their very expensive Burberry scarves, with their scarves still on. And yeah, and all the brothers with their Bibles and handbooks and white books, you know, right under their armpits like they always used to do.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1453s)

Okay, because I'm going to say they wouldn't normally allow in outsiders to cater, to be present at such a thing, right? And so, did I presume it was cooked off-site? The sisters didn't have to do that? Or like, was this partly to give the sisters a break from the heavy load? Normally fellowship meetings are an incredibly heavy load on them with regard to cooking and baking. I presume that they still used all of the Brethren homes for overnight accommodation, because that in itself was one of the thoughts.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1482s)

The thought process was, because the locals and anybody down from the top didn't know anything about this event until after school on Tuesday afternoon, yeah, and the thought process is the sisters didn't have time to provide the food. So when you kind of look at it, you know, go out from the 180-yard stare, probably a couple of heavies knew maybe a week in advance and ordered the food. That's kind of what you would suspect a little [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1512s), but definitely the sisters knew nothing about it. The kids at school knew nothing about it until they were home from school on Tuesday afternoon.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1522s)

And my understanding is that the organizing of all fellowship meetings and three-day meetings is now run by central trusts. Like in New Zealand, there's a central trust that organizes special meetings. So the local brethren in whichever locality is picked don't have much input at all. And it's just kind of put on them at the last minute, and all the travel and the catering and so on is organised at a national level. So in a case like this, what may have happened is the National Trust has locked in the details with Bruce Hales and then [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1552s) dropped the news on the locals at the very last minute.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1556s)

Right. Yeah, I'm just thinking back to fellowship meetings when I was in there, and normally you would have, I'm pretty sure you'd have months' notice, but at least weeks and weeks. And it was a big deal, right? And of course, it was a huge financial strain on the household because, for example, I remember going out and you would be checking all your linen and buying new entire sets of linen and sheets and towels to make sure you had the very best for your guests.

And you would clean your house from top to toe, and you would be filling the chest freezer with baking and [cooking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1586s) in advance. So yeah, that seems, that would be such a burden to have that suddenly thrown on you, both with the time and pressure, as well as, I'm thinking about the financial burden on households, not only those who are in Palmy, but those who suddenly had to drop thousands of dollars on flights. Have you heard reports of that?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1609s)

Speaking to young families who had to deal with this, that's something that comes up again and again, is when you have to take these charter flights for instance, you're looking at more than $600 a year for instance. And if you're a family with four kids, then you're looking at spending nearly four thousand dollars almost overnight to go to a one-day fellowship meeting. And there's a lot of discontent and grumbling behind the scenes that this huge cost was just dumped on young families.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1643s)

Yeah, that's crazy. Photos of them scurrying around at the grocery stores last minute, trying to fill up what they needed. So I mean, you think of the pressure that would have put on those females, like the Brethren wives, to have to shrink all that in in 24 hours, you know? Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1668s)

And so, yeah, any listeners who, sorry, just to make it really clear for any listeners who aren't familiar, you're not allowed to stay at non-Brethren accommodation, or that used to be the rule anyway. And we have heard of some reports of people doing that, sneaking in to stay into motels lately for business trips. But for an event like this, a fellowship meeting, you have to stay with Brethren households. And that's partly why Brethren got such massive houses, is because you're expected to be able to suddenly host 50 people for a meal or to [host](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1699s) 10 or 20 people to stay the night. Like we would empty out our garage and be lining it with beds, Maori-style.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1709s)

And the way they were getting around that, like I remember even before I left, the last fellowship meeting I went to in Christchurch, because they're now using these charter flights, they're flying people in in the morning and they're flying them out in the evening. So they're trying to have as few people as possible staying the night.

Which makes it, considering the money you're spending on it, like you might be gone from your hometown for less than 12 hours and yet still expected to shell out more than $600. And when you get there, you might just end up sitting in the foyer looking at a screen that you could have watched from your home meeting room anyway.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1750s)

Yeah, that's bonkers. So maybe that's partly why the meal thing happened, because it's like, heck, let's give them something. I mean, I remember in the days of Fun Days, so this was probably 2006 or seven or eight, I remember then, and that was a Fun Day was like an event to raise money for your local school. And we had alcohol served then, and it was like the best top-shelf stuff, and it was also eye fillet steak and that sort of thing.

And I remember, you know, I remember people [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1780s), "Oh, Bruce Hales has said we are the king's people, so make sure that there's blue label whiskey and eye fillet steak." And so yeah, that was, you know, that was 15 years ago for a Fun Day event for raising money. So it actually makes sense that this is the same mentality we're seeing, is hey, yeah, we're the king's people, we deserve the best, let's roll out. I guess it's what he would want, right? He wants to be served that stuff. And did somebody say there were also bands playing, like providing [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1811s) entertainment? Yep.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1812s)

Yep, Brethren bands playing in the parking lot. And my first question was, what kind of songs were they playing? Because you're in a church parking lot, right? So was it hymns they were playing? Oh no, it was all country and western songs, is what I've been told. It was not musical music, it was not hymns, it was country and western.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1834s)

Because you're missing going to festivals.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1836s)

Yeah, I mean, can you imagine going to a church parking lot for one of the fall festivals or, you know, fall bazaars? I don't know what they're called in New Zealand, but I mean, over here, if there's a band playing in the parking lot or whatever, they're playing old hymns and everybody's singing along. But no, in this mainstream Christian church, they're playing country western.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1859s)

Oh, that's hilarious. Please tell me they played songs like "Body Like a Back Road" and things like that, or "Take This Job and Shove It."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1868s)

Sorry, we lost you there, Craig. You're back. Go ahead. I love that, Richard.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1874s)

"Folsom Prison Blues," that's awesome.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1879s)

And I was told too that on Wednesday night, the young people went over to the band and started singing along with them. So it was getting to be kind of a spectacle in the parking lot and the heavies were not happy. You mean they almost had a...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1892s)

A mosh pit? Like, is that what you're saying? That the young people were gathered in front of the band and were like, oh my god, they might have nearly touched each other.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1904s)

Horrors. Anyway, the heavies were right there to try and dissipate, you know, so that it wasn't quite so obvious, this whole, you know, country western band is going on in the parking lot. But the kids didn't move. No, they were having fun. They were having a good time. It's the first time they've seen it, so they were going to make it count.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1924s)

It is fascinating. This brings back memories of the days of J.T. Jr. where he would get people to bring their guitars into the halls and pull them up on stage and be singing songs. This was in the 60s, it's like really strong reminders of that era.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1940s)

You're right, Craig. Yeah, it is. Bruce always said that the next Aberdeen would happen in here underneath his reign. So I mean, I think we are getting mighty close to that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1950s)

Just taking a few steps back, was there some specific troubles in New Zealand immediately before this event was organized that might have triggered this very last-minute arrangement? Did we hear there were some walkouts at some meetings or some areas or some specific unrest in the weeks preceding this event?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=1981s)

I can't speak for that. There's definitely been unrest in various localities. I think from a broader point of view, what Bruce Hales would be particularly worried about in New Zealand at the moment is the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, which expanded its scope of reference to look at the Exclusive Brethren along with other closed religious communities.

And the commission has interviewed dozens and dozens of former Brethren and they have been putting [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2011s) lot of their concerns to the Brethren. And so Bruce will no doubt be very aware of what the commission of inquiry is looking at in relation to the Brethren, and the final report is due out in March. So we're really in a crunch point now for how the Brethren are going to address this commission of inquiry. And there was talk, I don't know if this has been confirmed, that the New Zealand Brethren have been told not to shut up or withdraw from anyone until the [commission's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2041s) findings have come out. I don't know if anyone else can confirm that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2044s)

Yes, I've heard that. I've heard that there was quite an extensive amount of trouble in the top of the South Island, if I understand it correctly. And some quotes say a large percentage in one interchange area walked out. Wow.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2061s)

You know, that was a lot.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2062s)

Well, there was a great deal of looseness. Brothers that attended the Levitical meetings coming home and allowing barbecues and pre-recorded music off Spotify. They weren't even stuck with the Brethren bands, they actually used Spotify. What, you got to give it to them, I mean, they're a bit creative. But yeah, this has caused a big rift and of course, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2092s) were some new heavies brought up and they were supposed to go in there and clean it up and people were like, "No, not going to clean it up, we'll just walk."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2099s)

That's so interesting. Craig, didn't that letter, you're probably more familiar with the contents than me, but didn't that letter that came out say something, and it was like a bit miffed about, you know, how dare the Brethren do all this wildness when there's been such grace shown to us, or there's already generous provision provided to meet all of our needs? And that just cracks me up that, hey, the Brethren bands aren't good enough. Like, how dare you listen to Spotify?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2130s)

And how dare they go camping?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2131s)

I mean, to go camping and enjoy nature that God created, I mean, how awful is that?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2144s)

New Zealand’s an island, as far as I can see.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2148s)

When I was still in there, we got told horror stories about some young Brethren that went camping and saw a ghost in the middle of the night, and wasn't that a warning to us all not to go camping?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2159s)

Oh, that's hilarious. In Australia, they've been out into the bush, they saw this demon up a tree or something.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2169s)

Oh, it was probably a possum, seriously.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2172s)

It might have had something to do with what they were drinking.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2175s)

Yeah, well, isn't it John Spinks's book that's got a chapter about him seeing God in a Brethren meeting hall? I mean, that's a terrifying chapter if you believe it. It was terrifying, that's full on, man.

I also wanted to jump back to the schooling thing because, you know, I don't know if you've heard from any teachers or anything, but my mind is just blown that at someone's word, you know, the [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2205s) schooling system across a nation can be closed at 12 hours or less notice. And, you know, what must all the teachers think when they're sort of told, "Hey, you know, by the way, school's closed tomorrow and for three days, and oh, you know, just enjoy your break." Like, they must wonder what on earth.

And what does that do to their teaching plan? It was the end of the school term here in New Zealand, I think. Like, they would have been gearing up for sorting their kids out for the [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2235s) the break. And it's just fascinating. Like, yeah, at the Olive Leaf Network, we talk about the high-demand hand to try and assess if a group is, you know, a high-demand religious group. And it's got these five areas: your relationships, your resources, your lifestyle and your employment, and your education.

And if all those five areas are under significant control from the group, and particularly sort of a [daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2265s) impact or influence, and yeah, that just fascinated me to hear that this area of education, obviously, as we use it, it also applies to adult education. But here, obviously, OneSchool Global, we're talking about the kids. But yeah, just that, you know, at the crack of a, at the click of a finger, that you can close the schools for three days, that's a phenomenal level of control. And I just wonder what the teachers think.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2292s)

Well, in retrospect, how about all the businesses? So if you were one of the people that spent four thousand dollars to go there for six hours, eight hours, maybe ten hours, and you go home. You're talking about the trade show that they were in or even their businesses. Because if the Brethren get in vans and, you know, not necessarily all of them have staff that stay behind and keep their business open, you think, okay...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2321s)

Some large Brethren businesses had to close on Friday because there weren't enough staff left to run the place.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2329s)

Yeah, so you think they've invested their travel cost, and they've invested from the loss of school, and they've invested from the loss of sales in their businesses, you know, to one meeting and a party in the tent afterwards.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2347s)

Yeah, it's a significant cost, isn't it? You've got to wonder how many people are not too happy about it. But then again, you know, as I think Peter Hart said in that news article, Craig, if you didn't go, you know, the repercussions would be intense. And while you might not be immediately shut up or anything these days, if you dared to not go, it would be the equivalent of you saying, "I don't believe in Bruce Hales." And there would be a huge mark over your head and you would be being [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2377s). Like, people just would not dare to not go.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2381s)

For the Brethren, that end game is to end up in heaven and enjoy eternity. And they believe that Bruce Hales is an extension of God, and therefore to travel to meetings with Bruce Hales is like you're getting early access to heaven. And if you turn that down, like you're not just insulting Bruce Hales in their eyes, you're refusing the whole concept of God and eternity.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2405s)

Yeah, that's so true. You're like directly refusing to hear the current word of the Spirit.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2411s)

Yeah. "Oh no, I don't want to get a preview of heaven." Like, it's no, sorry about it. But to them, that's such a, you should sacrifice everything. Like, if you have to go into debt or if you have to rearrange your mortgage repayments, like it doesn't matter. Like the end, this is a window into heaven, so of course you would do everything you physically could to see Bruce Hales.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2436s)

Yeah, and I mean, practically, you would have angry people on your doorstep the next day. You would have visits from the priests and you would be interrogated as to why you didn't go. And they'd be questioning your beliefs and it's kind of a shibboleth, isn't it? It's kind of a test of your loyalty. And, you know, for people who didn't go and didn't have a very, very good excuse, there will be consequences down the line. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2467s) now they're just sitting waiting to see what those consequences are going to be.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2470s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2472s)

Yeah. To point out on, like, how Bruce is trying to see who's being loyal to him, right? I mean, we've talked about this for a long time now. What is his plan going to be to find out where the loyalty lies and where the loyalty doesn't lie? I mean, he has said it, he has said it out loud that he knows that he's the last leader. He says that, and that Aberdeen will probably be experienced, another Aberdeen will be experienced underneath his [man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2502s) of God experience he's having.

But you just think of this 24 hours' notice. Nobody gets given notice but 24 hours, right? And what a perfect way to see who is on board with him and who is not on board with him. What other church do you know of? What other mainstream Christian church would do something like this, right? And I mean, I personally know of some insiders in there that just refused to go, right? They didn't go.

I hope that they make it, you know, that they get the answers that they want out of this. But I do believe, I really firmly believe that this is Bruce's method of trying to figure out where the loyalty lies with him in such a harsh, critical time right now that he's having in there. Right? I mean, these podcasts, the Olive Leaf Network that came forward, all of this has put a [huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2559s) strain on his ability to be able to control his 50,000-plus members.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2566s)

That's, you know, calling a new fellowship meeting is the least controversial thing to do than to get into bed with a naked woman. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2575s)

But we have insiders, we've had insiders say that there's people talking inside there about him making plans on trying to find out where people's loyalty lies. And so you just sit there and you wonder. You wonder, is this one of his ways? Is this just, maybe he's just testing theories of finding who's being loyal to him and who's not? Because he's under a lot of duress. When he has this kind of controversy floating through everything, it causes him a lot of problems. It really does.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2605s)

The other thing I would be curious to hear your thoughts on, I hear reports of like really extreme security measures that are along with whenever he gets together somewhere. And I find them fascinating. Like, I've heard someone tell me recently that sniper points are, like, checked by a security team and, like, all around the halls and wherever Bruce is staying in a house. And that just blew my [mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2636s) that it is perceived by him as a very genuine threat that he could be taken out by a sniper.

Because, again, you know, I could be wrong, but maybe I'm not aware of stuff, but I've never heard of any ex-member talk about, or in any seriousness, actually wanting to kill Bruce Hales. And you'd have to be, yeah, very, very desperate, which I understand a lot of ex-Brethren are psychologically distressed and have been harmed. But they're distressed because they want to see their families, and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2666s) killing Bruce Hales isn't going to fix that. Like, I don't know, what do you guys think? Have you heard some extreme things around the security measures that are taken?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2677s)

But you see, if you drum up and create this like aura of "everybody's out to get me" and "it's so dangerous" and "all these pressures against me," in one sense, it is building up his own ego. You know, to present this, that people would want to take him out. And we've even been told that in order to have Bruce Hales in your home, you have to have a security team come in and go through your home and check your whole home, check the [number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2707s) of exits, make sure there's an exit that if a sniper should happen to come in, there's a back exit that he could be rushed out.

And he takes bodyguards with him. A first-hand account that he takes a non-member bodyguard with him. And in some places where he's gone, the non-member, of course, they don't let them sleep in the same places as members sleep, so they have a little shed out back where the non-member [bodyguard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2738s) sleeps. But when they take him to meeting, the bodyguard follows in a vehicle either directly behind or directly in front, just to make sure that he doesn't get harmed on his way to meeting. And by building himself up like that, it makes people think he is so important.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2754s)

And to me, the people that are out to get him isn't the ex-members. It's the people that are stuck inside there that have no way out because of businesses, have to do with children. There is, I would guarantee, there'd be more threat of a member still a part of the PBCC, in my opinion, to take out Bruce inside there versus any ex-member. We love our life, we're quite happy out here. Yes, we go through stressful times, [yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2785s) we miss our families.

But from the people that I talk to inside there and the stories that I hear of what happens inside there, I would be led to believe that it would be more of a member of a PBCC that is stuck in a very tight, hard position because he can't get out of what he's in.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2800s)

Oh my gosh, Cheryl, you're going to make them paranoid. They'll be like looking at me and not knowing who to trust. They'll know what I'm talking about. They'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Right? Yeah, I had heard the thing about exits as well, and at the halls, that there's always two vehicle exits and one is like really clear in case it needs to be a high-speed exit.

And yeah, we know he does things to avoid photos and that, right? Like having a big tent over the entry to the hall so that his blacked-out vehicle can drive into the tent, so that from the street or wherever else, he cannot be viewed. But yeah, have you heard any other things like about the security, Craig?

Not specifically, but I'm just thinking, like working as a journalist, we often encounter, say, the Prime Minister's security here in New Zealand. And if we have the Prime Minister coming into the newsroom, and bearing in mind you look at our, you know, our recent Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who did have a lot of these threats and there were real threats of violence against her.

I look at the level of security, and it was much more discreet and much more low-key. And it's like, if you've got an actual Prime Minister who's going around with actual death threats against them, and yet they're still prepared to go out and walk around in public and have members of the public approach them. To me, it seems like a lot of these security measures that they're taking for Bruce Hales aren't really about his personal security at all. They're about drumming up an atmosphere of fear and control.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2900s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2901s)

That's really interesting. Yes. Well, in an article you wrote, Craig, just recently, and there's a part in here that I do want us to discuss, and you kind of just mentioned it. I'm going to read just a short excerpt out of it: "In April 2005, when Clark was left bruised and shaken after an airplane door blew open on a chartered flight, the Brethren were told that if we'd been praying harder, Helen Clark would have fallen out of the door," recalls a former member. On another [occasion,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=2931s) an effigy of Clark was burned at a Brethren social gathering.

I think this is super important that we need to address on this topic. We haven't gone into depth with it before. It is their praying for the removal of people, praying for the deaths of people. Most people will remember my uncle just passed away this July. I haven't talked publicly about it because I had to myself digest and get through the hurt of what happened and what went down. But they took 110% satisfaction in thanking the saints for their hard work for my uncle's death.

And it was one of the hardest things for me to have reported to me. And it goes right here, here is just, this is a written article that talks about what they were praying for for Helen Clark. And it just absolutely infuriates me that a mainstream Christian church with a charity status can sit [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3003s) there and pray and wish people's death. And when they do die, they take credit for it. It's just not right.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3011s)

Further on in that same article, Cheryl, there's a reference to when the Greens co-leader Rod Donald did die.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3018s)

Here's another excerpt in this article, and I'll just read this out: "When Greens co-leader Rod Donald died suddenly the night before being sworn in as a part of the new center-left government, Brethren thanked God. Members believed his death was an answer to prayer." I have such a plea to the government in any way, shape, or form that there should be no, no Christian church should have a charity status.

Even access to charity status, [shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3048s) have access to their own school, shouldn't have access to, they should not be in this sort of exclusive community when they're teaching principles like this. If the Catholic church was to come out and do something like this, it would be all over the news, absolutely spread all over the news that these children get up and pray on Monday night for the removal of people. [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3078s) they're teaching people that this is okay. It's just, it just blows my mind.

When I got the phone call after my uncle passed away, I had never been so gutted in all of my life. I literally felt someone had ripped my heart out that these people actually, and guess what their next comment was? My first uncle passed away almost a year ago to the day, then this uncle passed away, and guess what their word was? "Cheryl's next." [Right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3108s) They know who they're going after.

So for me, obviously, you can't kill me that easily, trust me, you just can't. So I mean, you guys can wipe that right off your prayer agenda now. I don't go down like that. But it just blows my mind that these people can get away with this, and I don't know what we do about it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3128s)

And in context, your uncle was a witness in a potential sexual abuse prosecution, which is why they were so pleased that he passed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3139s)

So he had the same abuser as I did, and he had made a police statement. And it was, it was someone, this is so hard for me to talk about because it makes me so emotional that he never got to have his day in court. And it also, for them, it's just, for them to actually take credit was just, I couldn't believe it. I can't believe my parents are a part of this. I can't believe my brothers are a part of this. I can't believe that they have this thought pattern that their prayers are killing people.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3179s)

Yeah, it's really devastating to hear, Cheryl, and my heart breaks for you. I can't imagine how awful that is to hear that. I think it is testament to, you know, it's why when we have their spokesperson in New Zealand, Doug Watt, say, "Oh, we're a mainstream Christian church," it's why it makes statements like that just such a joke. Because, yeah, there's no mainstream Christian church that's encouraging its flock to pray for the death of those who threaten it, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3209s) who are claiming that any such deaths are a result of, you know, divine intervention and blessing on their part.

It's very un-mainstream. And yeah, I mean, high-demand or cult-like groups do, they have a huge us-and-them thing, as we know, right? They have a huge us-and-them divide. And I guess what you're seeing is the pointy end or the extreme end of what happens when groups [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3240s) extreme categories of us and them and start to demonize anybody who tries to hold them to account.

Because that's all this is. You know, and in your sexual abuse situation, you're not just out to attack them because it's a fun idea for you or because you're a bully. You are trying to set right a very, very serious case of abuse that has gone completely not held to account and with no [restitution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3270s) or anything. And the person who was at fault is still at large. That is all you're trying to do. And yet in their mind, or for any organization like this, they view accountability as attack and persecution. And that's like an insight into their mentality here. And that must be incredibly distressing to see people like your own flesh and blood family caught up into that mentality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3294s)

My heart breaks for those children that are being trained like this, right? We think of where all this bullying comes from in their schools. We hear the stories of the absolute language and what they say to people outside of their congregation and how they talk to people. Well, it stems from literally them getting up Monday night and praying for the removal of people. They literally believe that they have this power to be the ones that [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3324s) who can be on this earth and who can't.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3328s)

It's important to go back to what the outlook of prayer normally would be. And I think that if you go to any church, not even a mainstream church, they would say if you're going to pray about a tough situation, you would pray that someone gets help, or someone gets a change of mind, or that you can help somebody. You know, you pray for your enemies, you pray that they will get help. You [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3358s) pray for their death. It's such a contradictory teaching.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3364s)

This is, I think, really another important part of that is to look at the passion of the group. And it's not when it comes to death and prayer, it's not just the enemies that die, they also believe that they die if God wants to send them a message. The number of times that a young Brethren person was killed in a car crash, and then we were told, "Oh, that was God speaking to us because we weren't following the rules."

And I read my great-grandmother's diaries [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3395s) the 70s when there would be some terrible car crash, or even like your father's death, Carman, and it's all, "What is God saying to us? Why has God killed this person? What message is he trying to send us?" And that whole idea that there is a god that is just sitting there smiting down not only our enemies but also people that we care about if we're not listening.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3422s)

A very punitive...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3423s)

Yeah, it's a long way from what most Christians would understand prayer to be.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3431s)

Yeah, it's a very punitive and fear-based god, isn't it? And actually, it's a bit appropriate to make a joke probably, but seeing as so many Brethren grew up reading Far Side comics in the breaks when they were bored, it reminds me of that Far Side one where God's got this enormous grand piano over top of someone's head and he's about to drop it. So he's pressing, he's pressing the smite button, isn't he? He's got the smite button and there's this grand piano about to just go boom on someone's head. But seriously, that is kind of the view of god that [they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3461s) got.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3462s)

Yeah, I may have talked about this last time I came on the podcast, but might as well repeat the story.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3469s)

Oh, we've lost him.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3474s)

Yeah, we've got him.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3477s)

I think it's important in what you are saying to remember it's not a punishment when something bad happens. Bad things happen to everybody. It happens to good people, it happens to bad people, and it's not necessarily a punishment. It's what helps us grow. Go ahead, Craig, now you're unfrozen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3506s)

You were going to tell us a story.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3507s)

Bad day for my internet, I'm sorry. Yeah, when I was leaving, just in the last few weeks, a Brethren couple took me out for lunch to a restaurant and begged me to stay in fellowship. And I said no, that I was going to leave. And the following evening, one of the waitresses from the restaurant was killed in a car crash on the way home.

And I've never forgotten the husband of the couple came around and he talked to me at work, and he just had this almost [triumphant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3537s) look on his face telling me about this teenage waitress that had been killed in a car crash because surely this was a message from God that I needed to stay in the Brethren. And I just thought, the very idea that God would be out there killing some teenage waitress that I didn't even know to send me a message that I should stay in fellowship was, I couldn't believe it then and I still can't believe it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3564s)

Well, I mean, it brings me back to the thing that I often say is that the Brethren aren't actually that acquainted with scriptures because there's a whole lot of scriptures just even in the gospels themselves that totally contradict all this theology. Like the classic one is the man in John 9 and the blind guy, and the disciples bring him to Jesus and say, "Did he sin or did his parents sin that he's, you know, had this calamity of being born blind?" And Jesus said, "Neither of them. It's just so that, you know, the works of God can be shown," or something like that.

[And,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3594s) you know, going back to the praying for your enemies, like Jesus himself, who is supposedly the one who shows us God, said to pray for your enemies and bless them. And so you're like, come on people, you're claiming to be Christians and to be mainstream churches, like why don't you go and have a wee read of the gospels and start looking a wee bit more like Jesus, please?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3612s)

Yeah, the Brethren don't really like the gospels, they're much more at home in the epistles, aren't they? The gospels are a bit of a sideshow.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3620s)

I think they're more at home in Leviticus.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3628s)

Yeah, it's a bit of selective, a bit of selective reading goes on, I think.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3632s)

Yeah. Hey, jumping back to the security thing, I have had reports from a relatively recent leaver who had familiarity with the security side of things who said that it was fairly common for a locality that was going to host Bruce Hales to face a bill of around New Zealand $200,000. And that would involve all that sort of thing of staking out and checking through the properties, updating the security cameras, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3662s) all that type of thing.

So yeah, that's a tremendous bill for a locality to hold. And again, I'm wondering, you know, does that, is that all funnelled through their charitable trusts, things like that? You know, these are incredible bills, aren't they, for localities to have to fork out to supposedly protect Bruce Hales.

And I also have had relatively recent leavers share with me some stories about just before Bruce Hales was due to visit, having a [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3693s)\-degree eye camera inserted in the center of the main hall. So I don't know if any people who were at the meetings in Palmy noticed this, but apparently it was very discreet. Like it was, yeah, almost impossible to see with the naked eye unless you were really, really looking for it, set in the tiles of the ceiling. But yeah, you know, just perhaps a word of warning for some of those people in those conferences who like to pick their noses in public and things, but you know, you're on camera. You're [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3723s) camera, whatever you do. This wasn't a big camera that you could notice, this was, it was concealed. Yes, it was very, very discreet. Apparently, it was actually embedded in through the ceiling and with just a tiny bit of the eye kind of visible in the ceiling tiles, which, you know, the ceiling roofs are quite high, especially in the center.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3743s)

Yeah, that would mean, for instance, that if any pictures did come out from inside the hall, they would be able to go back and review the footage and see who had perhaps taken the picture.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3753s)

Yeah, in theory, in theory. I have no idea, obviously, of the quality of the footage that's being taken, because if you've got thousands of people, it's going to perhaps still be quite challenging to pick through it and see who was taking a photo. But yeah, I think there's definitely a word of warning there that people are probably being videoed much more than they realize. I mean, for all we know, there's video cameras in the toilets and the showers. Oh no, there's no showers, is there? But yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3780s)

So do we think that this camera is in all of the meeting halls, or it was just put in there because Bruce was going there?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3790s)

Yeah, in this case, this was, I mean, this was several years ago now, the specific instance in Auckland before Bruce was due to arrive. So I imagine if that was standard practice several years ago, it's most likely to be the same, if not more so now, especially as camera technology has advanced. And back then, that camera alone was worth several thousand dollars and had been, you know, properly installed up through the ceiling.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3818s)

And if you really think about it now, do you think there's that many more security risks than there was say 50 years ago? Like you think back to J.H.S. in Neche he lived down that little driveway, but it was nothing for him to get in his wheelchair and for one of his sons to push him all the way down the driveway and all the way up to the meeting room. No security guards, no bodyguards, no security cameras. I mean, really, is the risk that high right now?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3851s)

Yeah, it does speak to two things, doesn't it? One is that, as you guys have already said, there's this desire to portray to the Brethren that he's in grave danger and to kind of build it up and justify the private jet and the private helicopter that we've heard multiple accounts of him using. Or, you know, the other thing it points to for me is somebody who is incredibly paranoid or has a very, very disturbed conscience that some chickens are going to come [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3881s) to roost.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3884s)

Let's say it's the latter. Yeah, on the topic of security, I do think that when it comes to these special meetings, it's important to point out as well that he's not just being protected from the world, he is also being protected from Brethren themselves. So he walks up and down designated aisles, and they have designated guards stationed at the end of each aisle. And so it's physically impossible for anybody in that hall to directly approach [Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3915s) Hales. It's to stop people from directly approaching him to have an unplanned, unscheduled conversation with him. And so all of the people on the ends of the aisles are hand-picked specifically to stop members from approaching Bruce Hales for a conversation he's not expecting.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3936s)

Oh, wow. So what pattern do you use to support that idea? I mean, you know, you go through the scriptures, the Lord had no problem talking to anybody. He didn't have to have special pre-arranged conversations with people. If you're the man of God, you're representing the Lord here on earth. Why do you have to have conversations pre-scheduled? And why do you have to be protected from the innocent person that might have a question to ask you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3965s)

But if you're the leader, your flock should be able to access you. I have this image in my mind of a video that I watched one time when the Pope came, I don't know where he was going, and him walking along and shaking everybody's hands, right? Like, could you imagine Bruce doing that to his flock, them all lining up to see him and him shaking everybody's hands? Yeah. Not gonna happen, right?

It just, I don't know, my mind is just [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=3995s) it gets blown every time I do one of these podcasts, but today it really is, in the sense that I just don't see how, I don't get how these people have a charity status. I just don't. And I just believe, I really honestly used to believe, call me naive, call me gullible, but I used to believe that this church might be salvageable. I do not believe that anymore from the reports that come from out of there now.

I don't believe that. I think it's far too diseased. I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4025s) this needs to crumble to the ground. And to all the people that are inside there, there are plenty of gorgeous, beautiful, compassionate churches around you that would receive you with open arms, that you'd be able to 100% be able to understand what Christianity is like, truly. Like, don't be afraid of that. Don't be afraid of the PBCC falling down. There is a ton of churches out here that will grab you. They will hold you, they will comfort you, they will nurture you back to health.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4056s)

And where leaders are very approachable and will talk to you anytime you walk up to them at church.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4061s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead. We did hear, like, I don't really know what Bruce actually taught about at these meetings, because unlike the Brethren might like to think, I don't have, you know, loads of moles or anything like that in there. And people who are leaving, who we're supporting through Olive Leaf Network, you know, we're just primarily supporting them. We're not, we don't actually pick over them and dig them for information.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4091s) yeah, I don't actually know really, you know, what he taught at those meetings. But we did hear reports that on Wednesday, he spoke about treating people with care and compassion, and possibly even, I'm not sure about this, but treating former members with care and compassion. Which if so, that's fascinating because we had quite a few reports of people who the week before were getting quite nasty messages from family members, like saying that they were, you know, going to hell and all that sort of thing. And then all of a sudden on Wednesday after five o'clock, they were getting messages or phone [calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4121s) saying, "Oh, you know, how are you?" just sort of sending a message of love and care. And you know, again, I just thought this is bonkers that, again, why did the people have to wait to be told from the leader to show care and compassion? Like, come on people, you know?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4140s)

So I'm going to share, he probably wasn't talking about this then. We don't think he was. I'll just share some of his other teachings. So this is just, I mean, we perused and grabbed some of his old teachings here from 2005\. "You drink for strength." Yeah, so this is someone asking, "Well, we have a difficulty with mid-afternoon preachings." And Bruce says, "Is that because they've had too much to drink in the break?"

And this person says, "Well, they're both pensive and pious, I suppose." Bruce says, "We won't use another word. I think it would be more applicable than pious. See, there's probably..." What's this? Does he mean pissed? Uh, maybe. "See, there's alcohol served in the breaks at lunchtime. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4190s) what I think. We went through many years where we didn't have any alcohol. Our beloved brother used to emphasize that you drink for strength, not for drunkenness. Young people addicting themselves to hard liquor is foolish, utter, utter foolishness, apart from being dangerous to your health and to the lives of the public on the roads."

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4210s)

And then here's the context there. R.S.K, there is Dr. Kirkpatrick. It's Roger Kirkpatrick, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4222s)

But can we just, like, the confusing thing is that you've got this teaching here and then you've got what happened last week with the, how much was it worth of alcohol, did you say, Carman? A hundred thousand dollars worth. A hundred thousand dollars worth of alcohol, and that would not happen without categorically being instructed by Bruce Hales. So the man is such a complexity, isn't he?

And people do often talk about this. I hear them talking about it, how some people [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4252s) they've experienced him being kind to them or being generous. You know, there's multiple accounts of him giving out fifty dollars or a thousand dollars here or there. Or other people have said, "Oh, he was genuinely kind to me." So you do get kind of these times when he seems to be more of a trustworthy or sensible or sane kind of leader. And then on the other hand, you've got just as many stories of him being brutish or being a bully or, you know, Craig, you've talked about witnessing him [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4283s) throwing back tumblers of whiskey in a break, right? Like, you know what he's like. He's a complexity, isn't he?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4294s)

Everybody's toes that way, right? Like, I do want to just read out this one last one here on the bottom. "Certain unacceptable features based on irrefutable witness and universal reports are as follows: excessive drinking, alcohol in meeting rooms..." and presents. Like, think of what they just did in Palmy with all the alcohol in the meeting rooms, which back in 2005 was an absolute no-no, right?

Like, I do think that that's [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4324s) he keeps them going, is by this push-pull that I was referring to before. It's a rule, it's not a rule. It's a rule, it's not a rule. And it just, it shows them, these people then become these marionettes and these puppets of what he's allowing and what he's not allowing. He's able to exert his control in a way and see who's with me, who isn't with me, right? He's always getting to know.

Whereas, let's go back to, you know, Mr. Symington, [right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4354s) I mean, I don't remember a whole lot of his era, but I don't remember rules coming in and rules going out, rules coming in, rules coming out, right? It was just one set of rules that you followed and you didn't steer away from them. Whereas Bruce has come in and it's very much this yo-yo effect of, you know, tightens them up and then he gives them freedom.

I remember the first time I had talked to my mom and she had said, "Oh, Cheryl," this is after Bruce got in there, and because I was part of John Hales's reign, and when Bruce came in, "Oh, Cheryl, everything has changed. It's so different. You know what, the young children, there's so much more that you get to do. It's so different in here." And I'm like, "You know what, I'm happy for you that it's good for you, but I would never in a million years ever step foot back inside something like that again." But it [gives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4406s) them this feeling of clamping down and then giving the freedom, clamping down and then giving them the freedom.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4412s)

Very cult-like, very cult-like, yes. Which is what Craig said that Professor Lineham said, that that's a classic kind of thing that leaders of high-demand groups do. But yeah, I mean, it is pretty clear that they're making the cage more and more and more golden and adding more and more little swings and bells for the people to play with, but it's still a cage, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4432s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4432s)

Yeah, it is. Yeah, I mean, so that was 20 years ago that you weren't allowed alcohol in the car park. And fast forward 20 years and you're serving a hundred thousand dollars worth of alcohol. It just makes me think, okay, in 20 years' time, what, will they be handing out condoms in the car parks?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4449s)

I mean, the Lord turned another corner. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4459s)

Yeah, I mean, when I was a teenager, I talked about the Lord turning a corner and we used to joke that the Lord had turned so many corners he must be dizzy by now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4469s)

That's true. Yes, it is true. I do want to bring up your other article that you wrote, Craig, because it was incredible. And this is for the insiders that might not have access or not know about what went on in Palmerston, because we do know that some of them had no clue what was happening there. And so I'm just going to share your other article that you did. So this is an article that's called "Private Jets, Prison Vans in Palmy: Inside the World of Last-Minute Brethren National [Gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4499s)." Do you want to just walk the viewers and listeners through this, Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4504s)

Yeah, so this is just, nothing spectacular about it really. This is just a pulling together of everything that happened and what the reasons were behind that, how the meetings unfolded at a logistical level, and how the Brethren got there, the impact that it had on things like the travel network, what usually happens at these kinds of meetings. So none of this will be particularly surprising to anyone who's in the Brethren, but what this is really is an explanation [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4534s) people out of the Brethren as to just what on earth is going on and what it means for the Brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4542s)

Incredible article. I thought you did such a great job of covering absolutely every angle you could on here. So if you haven't read this article, there'll be a link attached to both articles in the description of this podcast, and it would be, yeah, it's very good to read this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4561s)

Yeah, it was brilliantly done, Craig. Thank you for that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4564s)

It was so well done, so well done. One of the best articles I've read covering everything in a long time. That was so good.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4571s)

He is a very good journalist.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4574s)

We're very grateful that you found that path after leaving.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4577s)

I have to ask, what was the reaction to the pictures as they were taken?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4587s)

I am not entirely sure on that front. From memory, the Brethren are usually told to ignore photographers and journalists now, because in previous years, we'd be going back sort of 15 years or so, there were some quite unpleasant interactions between Brethren outside halls with journalists and photographers, and I think the lesson from there has been to ignore them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynNxoAcqohk&t=4614s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
