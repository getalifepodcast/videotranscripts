## Summary

Michael Bachelard is Bruce Hale's nemesis.  Having blown the cult's appalling history of political,  financial and sexual crime wide open in numerous newspaper articles and the famous book, "Behind the Exclusive Brethren". He then added insult to injury by not being struck by lightning, dying of leprosy or succumbing to any other curses that the ever vengeful cult expected a wrathful God to smite him with.  In fact, as you will see, he looks remarkably cheerful.  Michael reveals some eye-popping details about the late Tony McCorkill that will have Bruce frothing with rage, scoops some particularly mephitic dirt on the late unlamented Dr. Kirkpatrick, and gives some titillating inside information on how he has pulled the wool over the brethren's eyes.  He's led them up the garden path and left them up the creek without a paddle.

### [**Get-A-Life Podcast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=8s)

We have Peter with us and we have a special guest, Michael Bachelard. He comes to us from Australia, the land down under.

Welcome.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=21s)

Thank you. And thank you. It's nice to be here.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=25s)

Do you want to just launch into your story and tell us where you came from, where you started, where you're where you're headed?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=30s)

Yep, so I'm a journalist. Uh, I've never been in the Exclusive Brethren. I've never, um, I've met very few, um, serving Brethren members, if you want to put it like that, but I've met a lot of ex-Brethren members and, um, it's really their stories and their, um, experiences that have motivated me to keep writing about this. I started way back in 2006\. And I'd just that year been appointed as an investigative reporter at The Age newspaper, which is a major Australian newspaper and based in Melbourne, Australia. And at that point, there was a lot going on politically between the Brethren and the opposition leader in New Zealand and the government in New Zealand. At that time, they had put private detectives on to tail [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=88s) then Prime Minister, Helen Clark, and her husband, in the attempt to prove that one or other or both of them were in fact closeted or hidden gay, and to expose this and therefore help their friends in the National Party, the Conservatives, to get elected. That when this came out, there was a lot of disbelief, but also kind of amazement. The story was clearly true. People couldn't believe that this little [non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=118s)\-voting, loopy Christian sect was interfering in politics in this way. And so I was slightly at a loose end and out of morning news conference came the request that I look to see if any such interference was happening in the forthcoming election in our state in Victoria.

So I rang a few of my contacts in the political sphere and found out very quickly that, yes, these kind of conservatively dressed men in brown trousers and short-sleeved shirts had indeed been dropping into the offices of then conservative opposition and offering their support at the forthcoming election. So I wrote that story simply as a kind of, hey, this is a bit interesting and scandalous as a news story and didn't think much [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=172s) of it until I got a call from an ex-Brethren member called Warren McAlpin.

And he, Warren at that point, certainly in Victoria, but really also in Australia, was one of the key kind of, like if podcasting existed in 2006, he'd have probably been doing a podcast like this. He was aggrieved at the terrible things that had happened to him and his family, his business and family had been removed from him overnight while he was at work. He got back to an empty house after his day at work. He'd been [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=207s) the whole family court mill at enormous length. I think my memory is a bit old on this. I think I'm right in saying there'd been 13 separate cases to try and get at least access to his two boys and, um, of course they'd all failed as they do and he'd finally, you know, mentally, spiritually, financially bereft, he'd given up, um, the the legal fight and he changed his [fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=237s) to the public domain. And at that in those days, so I think we were in the second iteration of the kind of chat groups that that sprung up for ex-Brethren members, uh, it was called Peebs.net, run by Tim Twynum in Vermont, and he was kind of quite active on that, as were many others. And anyway, Warren rang me and said, you know, you've touched on the tip of an iceberg here.

And he said two things that caught my attention. One was the suffering from this group is immense and virtually untold in Australia. And they are very close to the current government federally. So we were talking about a state election where I just established that they were cosying up to the Conservatives.

Nationally, at the federal level, a Conservative government was in power, the government of John Howard, and John Howard actually happened to represent the constituency that Bruce Hales lived in.

And Bruce Hales and John Howard were quite chummy and met regularly. At least that's what Hales said. There was no objective proof of that. But anyway, so the combination of the personal and the political piqued my interest. And Warren said, what you should do is go to the meeting tonight in Hadfield, which was a sort of an outer suburb of Melbourne, and try and get in and see what they're about. And I thought, OK, I'll do that. So I took a photographer and trooped out at 6 p.m. or whatever to the meeting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=333s) confronted locked gates. And I thought, this is my most unusual church.

And fairly quickly, a couple of the local heavies, they weren't that heavy physically, but they were heavies, came and stood at the gate and sort of stood in my way and said, well, you can't come in. And I said, well, look, I'm a, you know, I knew enough to know at that point that the Queensland Supreme Court, a different state of Australia, had removed their rate exemption because they were not running a place of public worship and that they had appealed that all way through the courts and tried to get to the high court [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=371s) and had failed to get into the high court so the Supreme Court decision stood that they were not a place of public worship and therefore they'd lost their rate exemption. I'd confirmed that in Victoria they were still getting their rate exemption. So I thought, well, ipso facto, you must be public, I'm going to try and get in. So I made that argument on the, uh, on the kind of grassy patch outside the locked gates in, uh, you know, out of suburban Melbourne for about five minutes until they got, uh, sick of me and closed the gate. And they must have closed the gate and walked inside, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=402s) people were still coming in in their cars down the driveway. So I just decided I would walk down the driveway. At this point, I'd lost the support of my photographer, I must say, who hung back, uh, you know, quite conservatively, uh, walked, so I started walking down the driveway, you know, waving a copy of this, uh, supreme court judgment, uh, as a shield and, uh, three at that point quite burly young brethren confronted me and said, we're going to call the police, you're trespassing, go away.

And, you know, the law of trespass says once you're warned and, you know, whatever that you're trespassing, you should probably get off the property. So I've made one point by that point anyway, got off the property, stuck around, got some photos, was physically threatened, a car driven right up to our ankles after the service on their way out. And the next morning I got a legal threat from their then lawyer, Philip Wiseman, for [defamation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=461s) and trespass and all sorts of other things. I thought, well, I must be onto something here. And that kind of, I guess, was the, that was 2006, why are we 2023?

That's kind of a 60, oh, I can't even do the maths. That's a long time that I've been kind of now writing about them very on and off and sporadically. But in 2008, a publisher rang me up and said, listen, you know, you've written so much about these people, you probably should write a book, shouldn't you? And I went, okay then. So I agreed to write a book, which was published in 2008, called Behind the Exclusive Brethren. And I was, I'm incredibly, I guess, I grew up in a very normal, very loving household.

I love my brother and sister. I talk to my mum weekly.

I still find it astonishing what people in the Exclusive Brethren are prepared to do to their family members by excluding them, by following, I don't know what they call it, the first family or whatever, and not the natural family.

I'm astonished by that. I'm astonished by the resilience of people who come out. But I'm really, I'm astonished by the kind of the factory of grief that it is. And in my book, I, you know, those first two things that on that very first day that I'd written about them that motivated me, the personal stories and the political, they essentially became the two halves of my book. And they still motivate me really in being interested in these guys.

And I remember really strongly, there's a chapter in my book about the goings-on in Albury. And I chose Albury because there are a few cases there that were really stark of various kinds. Um, uh, and you know, Bruce D. Hales' uncle had delivered a fire breathing sermon about how terrible Albury was and that kind of thing. There was an awful sexual abuse case in Albury which ended at finally these [unbelievably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=603s) brave little girls took on the Brethren hierarchy and got a got a guilty verdict and the the perpetrator went to jail.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=612s)

That story was heartbreaking.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=614s)

There were bomb threats to the court. It was phenomenal.

So I did a chapter on Albury, but then I did a chapter on another family called the Alderton family. And what really struck me about them was Alison, the mother, who by the time I was interviewing her, was very old, had been shut up with her husband, sorry, a couple of her daughters had left.

It strikes me that there's a bit of a pattern where women or girls tend to leave shortly after adolescence and before getting married. And men tend to leave in middle age when, you know, over kind of business or family disputes or this kind of, you know, that seemed, now there are people in this room who don't fit that mold obviously but but that you know is a bit of a interesting, yeah. Um, so I was in touch with a few kind of girls in their early [20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=673s) and I was in touch with some women in middle age who had left at that point and had lived their lives outside the Brethren and had told me about, you know, the awful things that happened, priestly visits where they'd been raped by the priests, stuff like that. But Alison's story, so I started off talking to one of her daughters, I think it was Priscilla, about the terrible things that her mother and father had done to them after they'd left and how they'd been completely locked out of that relationship and left on their own, 17, 18-year-old girls left on their own by their parents who rejected them. And then I realised that Alison, the mother, was also out. She'd been shut up with her husband for years, lived a Brethren lifestyle while trying to get back and then finally been withdrawn from. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=732s) ultimately, or sorry, actually finally had decided that the Brethren was full of shit and they were going to leave. And what I was really interested in there was trying, was was to talk to both the mother and the daughters about that and kind of, and there were two daughters, and to try and triangulate both the factual basis but also the emotional landscape of that.

 And in doing so, I realized [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=762s) Alison was, her dominant emotion was shame. She was mortified by what she had done in the name of the church to her own flesh and blood. And I felt so sorry for her, but it was so hard for the daughters to forgive her because, you know, at this formative time, they'd been abandoned by their family. And I just thought the horror and grief and distress and the lifelong damage, uh, that had been done in in those families, um, yeah, I really, I really, I [felt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=793s) for all the people involved in that. Um, so that's a very interesting point because we hear a lot now about the grief of people who leave, but there's a whole secret hidden side which is the grief of the people who remain, which is like a mirror image and that, yeah, that that's unspoken, unexpressed. Yeah, it's all...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=814s)

Based on their doctrine of separation, right? Which is just like abhorrently evil in its foundation.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=821s)

Yeah, yeah, that's right. I, I mean, that, sorry, you go, Peter.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=826s)

Yeah, well, in one sense, it's worse for those inside, because those of us that leave, I mean, you think myself, for instance, I'm able to get on and make a new life and do new things, whereas the other half is stuck in there and can't, I mean, you know, can't get remarried, can't do all those things, because that's not the right thing to do, and is absolutely stuck. I mean, it's your choice to stay.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=855s)

It's not really choice though, is it, Peter? I don't think. You grapple with this idea of choice.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=861s)

Yeah, that's right.

The only choice is to stay or to leave and lose contact with all her family, all her grandchildren and everything. So, yeah, it's absolutely heartbreaking.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=876s)

Yeah.

And then the grief is also intergenerational. I remember I was, I was launching my book at a at a bookshop in Melbourne and this kind of, I don't know, she'd have been in her 30s perhaps, woman came up to me and she had tears in her eyes and she said, I was in the Brethren until I was three years old. I don't remember it, but I can't remember if she was, they were withdrawn from or they left, I can't remember, but she said her life [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=908s) populated by empty chairs, you know, the aunts and uncles, the, you know, grandparents, all the other relatives, the, you know, the friends and so forth of her parents, the life of her parents that they had, that they talked about. Um, you know, she felt even though she had no memory herself of being in the Brethren, that that the grief and and loss of of, um, being withdrawn from, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=939s) was kind of intergenerational.  That really struck me actually. Um, and it's very sad. 

**Richard Marsh**

Yeah, I mean, it's one of the things that characterizes the Brethren, I mean, they're very similar in many ways to Jehovah's Witnesses and other cults. But the thing that really sets them apart is the fact that everyone is born into it. And that makes a big difference in terms of the depth of indoctrination. [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=969s) while, you know, the typical cult, they prey on vulnerable people, they induce them to join with love bombing. And then when it all goes pear-shaped, those people will revert to their previous existence, their previous personality. Yeah, but for those of us who were born into it, as everyone is, there's nothing to go back to. So when you leave, there's no reference point of normality to [return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=999s) to. You've always been in this weird bubble. It is their identity in a way. 

**Michael Bachelard**

Yeah, and so it's my experience of people who leave that, um, well, that they have a variety of experiences, but, um, you know, some some maintain a strong connection to a Christian faith, some reject it utterly and and dogmatically in some cases, um, some become just party animals really and, uh, and urge everybody else to just get over it, um, and forget about it. It's, you know, what's the point of kind of carrying on about it? And others, and others want to see, you know, some kind of redress or justice and maybe end up doing a podcast or going to the media or whatever else. But, um, but there [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1051s) yeah, there are, there are a lot of ways of dealing or or I guess of constructing a post-cult personality because you've got, as you say, Richard, nothing to refer to other than what you're born with. And one of the things that amazes me actually, and I think there's quite a good study in the Exclusive Brethren about human nature, is why it is that despite the depth and breadth and aggression of the indoctrination, that some people, particularly [young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1081s) women, it it seems to me, at 17, 18, go, no, this isn't for me. And that kind of spark of free will and kind of guts and chutzpah, which says I can, despite all the warnings that, you know, I mean, I heard one story about a mother telling her daughter, if you leave, I hope you get raped by the time you get to the end of the street because then you will know how bad the world is.

Not not that you will get raped, I hope you get raped. Um, you know, despite all that, people leave and that I reckon is, what does that say about the kind of the human spirit, uh, and and the the inability of even the heaviest handed, born in, bred in, in doc, multi-generational indoctrination, can't crush it, defeat it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1142s)

Yeah, that's very interesting. It's something I've noticed. I mean, I was driven out of the Brethren by a long period of extremely cruel treatment that eroded away crumb by crumb my faith. Whereas there's a few people, I think Lane would be one of them, who just never, never believed the stuff. And my uncle, my uncle also, Richard Marsh. I actually, I did believe, I was a Christian for a long, long time, even after leaving.

Yeah. But I mean, some people just never got indoctrinated. They never, ever, ever believed it. And those people, I think are, you know, they are admirable and exceptional people. But I think there's also a brain drain because over the years, over like 200 years, people with an independent spirit, critical thinkers, particularly intelligent and perceptive people have left the Brethren. And of course, at the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1200s) of Aberdeen, this big crisis, in very large numbers. And it's survival, it's evolution in action. They've now got a kind of a domesticated breed of humanity, you know, just like your domestic cow is less dangerous than a wild buffalo. The Brethren have been bred generation after generation. They've weeded out the independent spirits. They are evolving into a more docile subspecies of Homo sapiens. 

**Michael Bachelard**

Is that right, though? Because, I mean, in recent [times,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1230s) there's been quite a few people leaving, haven't they? I mean, I just heard, I was listening last night to your podcast, I can't remember her name, but a young woman who's left hiding.

So it still happens.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1245s)

Oh, yeah. There's a lot more than they would want you to believe, too.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1248s)

Yeah. But I also think the indoctrination is is worse in a way too because of the schooling systems now, right? They don't, they don't get that interaction with a normal schooling system that they used to allow. Now it's like just pumped in. Like they, you know, reading in your book how they make them answer those questions about evolution is just mind-blowing. Like you have to write in front of the answer, you have to write, "scientists claim", you know, like what [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1278s) you doing? Like stop trying to to suppress this information. And but that's exactly what they're doing. 

And, but I think COVID has been a crack in the door as well because they have learned what it's like not to go to church seven days a week. And I don't think they could, I don't know if now they could even get people to go back to seven days a week. They're still not doing it. They're still back to this hybrid system of only going to church, uh, two or three, [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1308s) times a week they meet and the rest of the time it's all done over Zoom and recordings. So there, I think there's hope for a big, a big break because people don't want to go. Why would you want to go back to that after seeing, after just not having seven days a week, right? Like the stress level alone of getting ready and going to church seven days a week, oh my goodness.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1329s)

I must say though, uh, just just to perhaps inject a note of caution here is that since I've been writing about the Brethren, uh, people have been, uh, prognosticating, prognosticating its demise, that this would be the thing that knocked it over, that, you know, the internet or that, you know, Peebs.net was going to and then and obviously, you know, the Brethren fear, fear these things because they shut them down as fast as they pop up. But, uh, but, you know, it's a, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1360s) know, as Richard says, it's a pretty self-sustaining kind of a system. Yes. Yeah. I mean, their biggest weakness, the biggest threat to them ultimately is the internet, because sustaining a cult at that level of necessity involves maintaining a high level of illusion. And the internet, with its sort of instant access to everything, is their worst enemy, and yet they can't survive without it.

That's their big, that's at the top of their agenda. How are we going to deal with this problem? How are we going to have enough internet to do business and yet not let everyone hear things like Get-A-Life podcast?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's really interesting. But I, for my many sins, spent some time looking at Streamline 3 instructional videos not that long ago.

And they've got some pretty cool technological solutions, if you like, that sort of thing, for surveilling and shutting people down. Yeah.

Mind you, a lot of people, I think, have two phones, don't they? That seems to be the answer.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1431s)

I've heard on the inside that everyone, they buy one that looks exactly the same. They just match it up. But that's smart.

But I would love to see a massive reduction in their numbers. I don't think they're ever going to go away, right? Like they would rather collapse down to one little compound in some country somewhere before they ever will, you know, give up or dismantle. But I would love to see a mass reduction in numbers with you doing this. But especially, but I think that's only going to come with media exposure from lawsuits and from going, some of them going to jail.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1465s)

Yeah. But the wealth, the wealth buildup is phenomenal. I mean, if wealth equals survival, you know, I'm seeing, you know, you see in the recent property sales in and around Sydney and the, you know, the sales of some of their businesses to private equity for squillions of dollars, hundreds of millions. They are certainly amassing a lot of cash for the end times.

Anyway, look, I'll talk about a couple more stories and sort of events that have occurred to me since the writing of the book as well. Yeah, right ahead. So pretty much every time I've put pen to paper about the Exclusive Brethren, I've had a threat of some kind. I've mostly for defamation, and but also for, there's religious tolerance laws in Victoria, they've certainly threatened me with, uh, with suits around breaches of religious tolerance. Um, and there was another suit, uh, which was an odd hybrid of criminal and civil. Um, I'll start, I'll come to that in a sec. My next sort of major foray into writing about them, um, I I had always had, even when he was, [uh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1545s) the official spokesman for the Brethren and through the writing, actually, I lost contact with him for a while, but but early on and then picked up later, I had a good relationship with Tony McCorkell. Now, I don't know if people here or the listeners know much about Tony McCorkell, so I'll give a brief gloss. Tony McCorkell was, his family was kicked out when he was a toddler as well. And he had a bit of a fascination with them. Later in life, as he grew up, he [became](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1575s) a bit of a public relations professional and a bit of a grifter.

And he decided when I started writing about them, he rang me and said, you know, intrigued, I'm a former member, I'm also in PR, they're doing, you know, they're not doing themselves any favours with the way they're going about things. You know, what do you reckon? Should I offer myself my services to them? And I sort of said, and I can be a double agent for you. And I sort of said, you know, you do you, chum, but, you know, if you've got information for me, happy to receive. So he did precisely that. And he got [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1611s) close, in fact, to Bruce Hales. And they would drink whiskey together in Hales' house at night if Hales couldn't sleep. And, you know, Hales would tell him about his insecurities, about being the, you know, was he really the man of God? And they'd get pissed together and drink Blue Label. And it was all very chummy at the great cost of both their livers.

Anyway, McCorkell eventually kind of drank the Kool-Aid and rejoined and became their spokes…their official spokesperson.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1649s)

Um, so is he still a double agent at that point, do you think or not? Did the information stop? Did the information stop when he switched?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1656s)

So, so...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1657s)

Yeah, so when he rejoined, was he still a double agent? That's what I'm asking.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1661s)

No, no, he wasn't. That's, that's the period during which I kind of lost contact with him. So he was sincere when he joined. He really did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was, he was, um, I asked him afterwards what he'd been thinking and he kind of, he found it hard to unscramble. It was like it was a, he couldn't, he couldn't quite work out what he'd been thinking. I certainly couldn't articulate it, which I found very interesting. Anyway, or maybe he just didn't want to tell me because he was a bit of a grifter.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1691s)

Maybe it's what he was drinking [rather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1691s) than what he was... Well, that also could be the case. Um, maybe like your brain cells as well as liver cells.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1699s)

Yeah. Um, but you know, typically before he, he rejoined, you know, a typical interaction would go a bit like this. Um, he'd ring me up and he'd say, mate, Hales is about to come to the office and I've got to pretend to really give you a hard time about that last story. So, uh, you know, but just to let you know, it's no hard feelings. And then you hang up and then five minutes later, Bachelard, you toad, you know, blah, blah, like this. And you know, you know, Hales is sitting in the room listening. So that was kind of, you know, that [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1729s) once or twice. Yeah. Anyway, so, so I wrote the book. Oh, and one of the things he he did was he, uh, he managed to talk one of the Albury elders, Chris Shaw, into meeting me and allowing me to put questions to him.

That was kind of extraordinary. And Shaw then later tried to disavow all that and say it was all off the record. But I put that conversation in the book anyway. And I got to ask him questions about, you know, sexual abuse and that kind of stuff. None of it was pretty enlightening. I got the Brethren line, but it was, you know, it was great actually to be able to put these questions directly to a human being, not just a PR agency.

So in my book, I slightly cheekily in the acknowledgements, I thanked Chris Shaw and Tony McCorkell, who at that point was still in, for all their help. And though we didn't see eye to eye on various things that, you know, it was good. Apparently they got in quite a bit of trouble over that. So anyway, so a bit later I'm addressing, I'm invited to address a cult conference in Queensland. And McCorkell turns up with his new young wife, who also [ex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1808s)\-Brethren, who he'd married, and they'd come out together.

And he was sort of at this conference partly to talk to me, partly to, I think, you know, try and figure out what had just happened to him and all the rest of it. And some of the other ex-Brethren there, mind you, were not best pleased to see him and there was a bit of a confrontation. Anyway, fast forward a few years.

I'm talking to some sex abuse survivors from the Brethren and about how their cases were covered up.

And I decided to ask McCorkell if he would reflect on that time because I knew from previous conversations and from his name on press releases and things like that that he'd been involved in these cover-ups. And he agreed to go on the record. And I wrote a story quoting three sex abuse survivors about their stories and McCorkell's account of how it had looked from the inside.

Now, the Brethren, it's safe to say, did not like that story. And they consulted a lawyer in Melbourne, sorry, in Sydney, which is the defamation capital of the world. It's got more defamation cases than any other jurisdiction because the laws are so terrible for media defendants. And this lawyer and the Brethren cooked up a plan where PBCC Limited, the company, which [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1901s) a small company with only a small number of directors, but is the governing body for the church, could sue The Age and me for defamation because, and what they had to prove was that we had defamed the company.

Now, the judge found this a bit hard to believe because all the events we were describing had happened before the company had been formed and kicked the case out saying you can't sue, you can't have been defamed for doing something that you didn't exist to be doing. I thought that was quite a sensible outcome.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1937s)

That is hilarious.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1937s)

Yeah, but then the PBCC, of course, um, appealed and the appeal court by a two to one margin found their case at least convincing enough to say, no, you have to go back and try it.

Now, so we were sent back to the original jurisdiction, the Supreme Court, to run a full defamation trial, which costs hundreds of thousands, if not millions.

So that happened. And then in parallel to that suit against me, I have to be a little careful here not to traverse anything that might get me in trouble, but another suit arose out of that same story, which was an allegation that I had identified a child victim of sex abuse. I hadn't. I hadn't named anyone. But [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=1997s) argument was that there was enough information in this article for people to deduce who I was talking about.

I call it the Jane Doe case because that's the name it was lodged in. So that also went to the court and we took that all the way to judgment and we won that. They appealed.

So we've got these two court cases kind of on foot. And around the same time, Laurie Moffitt is being jailed in the UK for a breach of, for contempt of court over a breach of privacy. Sorry, what did I say? Laurie Moffitt. Oh, Laurie Moffitt, beg your pardon, in the UK.

That's my mistake, Laurie Moffitt. And there's another case against another senior sort of ex-Brethren person, Ian Mackay. So there's all these court cases going.

And I think at that point, there's some agitation in the UK to, and I think The Times ran a story about, and we certainly ran a story about all these court cases and how could that possibly fit with the detriment and harm ruling by the Charities Commission. And I'm surmising all this, I do not know this for sure, but at about that time, the Brethren offers to settle our cases on a walkaway basis, which means everyone pays their own costs and the cases just lapse. We [agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2086s) to that and we agree to taking down the story as a result. So that was the result and I'm bound by a court order to say I'm happy with that result.

But you know, just just all of that is complicated and probably far too much detail, but it is to illustrate that writing about them, even if you're a non, never been a Brethren, uh, is a, you know, is a hazardous undertaking as well because they have very large amounts of money as we all know and they are quite prepared to use it to patrol the boundaries of their organization. Yes. And they remain, I believe, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2127s) well politically connected with conservatives. I have evidence of them campaigning, of Brethren members campaigning for Scott Morrison, who is the former conservative Prime Minister of Australia.

And yeah, that's so fast forward to today. I haven't written about them for a long time. I'm quite interested in getting back into this space. And what I'm particularly interested in is case studies like yours, Richard, where they've used their finances and the courts and, you know, as we know against Lance Christie as well, the police and the prosecution services to take action against people who have left and are trying to, as you say, establish themselves in their world and who they are and in some cases suffering enormous kind of mental health issues as a result.

And the worldly courts and police seem content to do that, to help them do their dirty work, which I find astounding. Yes, absolutely. I mean, one interesting question that comes up is you point out that Sydney is the defamation capital of the world. So equally, there must be places where it is a lot easier to write and to speak and to put and to broadcast about them, jurisdictions where it would be difficult for them to to come after you. Is that the case?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2219s)

Uh, well, the US would is the kind of, is the best example of a place to where you can speak freely.

Um, Carman, some of the things I've heard you say on this podcast and elsewhere, I don't think you could, you could comfortably say in Australia.

### [**Host**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2232s)

You won't get sued, but you might get shot.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2235s)

Yeah, well, that's true. Yes, I think on balance, I'd prefer the suit.

### [**Host**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2243s)

I don't know, Carman's got a couple of guns. She'll probably shoot back.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2249s)

I'll...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2249s)

Just stick my goats on them. Um...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2252s)

That's right. Uh, and the UK has better laws than Australia too. Um, there's been, there's, well, they have had some recent, um, they've had some recent, uh, law reform which makes it harder for certainly for organizations like the Brethren to sue. Um, yeah, I don't actually know if they'd try it again now. Um, but I wouldn't put it past them. There's the Streisand effect, isn't it? It's always a big gamble that they can, and it's often happened to them that they've drawn far more attention to an issue by suing than if they'd just let it go. But they don't, they don't seem to learn. I, you know, well, well, that that's, that's actually right. Um, and look, my attention was initially drawn to them and the, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2298s) know, in many, in many jurisdictions around the world, attention was drawn to them by their sort of ham-fisted political activism, uh, in the mid 2000s, uh, taking out ads for George Bush in the New York Times, um, running massive, um, you know, uh, kind of campaigns trying to fly under the radar, but not very well against gay marriage and so forth in Canada.

And their support of John Howard and anti-Greens ads and that kind of thing in Australia and, you know, tailing the New Zealand Prime Minister, for God's sake.

So yeah, a great deal of, they've brought a great deal of attention to themselves by their sort of their interactions with worldly things.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2347s)

The Kronbach Papers...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2348s)

are extraordinary.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2349s)

Like books like that?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2350s)

Yeah, like that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2354s)

It's a book full of letters written to George Bush about the laws in Canada.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2361s)

Yeah. Yeah, asking the president of the USA to intervene in Canada. You know, that's like asking the, you know, the the prime minister of New Zealand to to intervene in Australia. It's a different country.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2378s)

Wait, they they wrote letters to the United States president to see if he would intervene in Canadian same-sex marriage laws?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2386s)

Yeah, yeah. It's a little like Tucker, Tucker Carlson, you know, the famous right-wing commentator was suggesting that the US should invade Canada to get rid of the socialists.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2397s)

See this letter? It's on behalf of Canadians, but four of the seven signatures are from America.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2407s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2408s)

And that one, Rob Scott.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2410s)

I didn't sign that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2411s)

Body Diplock, Chuck Truman, and Terry Markham.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2415s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2416s)

That's the four American guys that are writing on behalf of Canadians.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2420s)

Yeah. The fact that they have the audacity to think that that actually even might work is just like stupid. Or even get to the president's desk.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2428s)

This is a...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2430s)

presentation that was given to Senator Richard Burr. Because the only way you can get a book like this to a president is if you have a senator give it to him. So this book was given to Richard Burr. And inside here is a table.

This table is the Brethren's organization to go to government in elections and there's eight pages I believe in here of names.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2463s)

And what year is that, Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2467s)

2006\.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2467s)

Yeah, it's that, it's that period.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2469s)

Yep.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2470s)

So apparently...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2472s)

This one is just a whole letter to, here's a message of encouragement from the Brethren to George Bush.

That's a letter.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2482s)

And then I guess they, they try and tell the flock that, oh, he reads these in his daily briefing along with the CIA and and everything world news, Bruce Hales right there. I guess that that's what they think the president like, yeah, I mean it's all educated...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2495s)

It's coil bound, yeah, and it was given to him by Senator Richard Burr.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2501s)

I mean, inside the Brethren, we were given to believe, and I sincerely believe this, that world leaders like John Howard and George Bush and whoever it was in the UK, when they hit a particularly tricky case, they had a hotline to Bruce Hales or John Hales, and they called him up for advice. And I mean, these letters that Carman is waving around, they're like full of quite sincere advice. We suggest you do this. We suggest you [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2531s) that. You need to do this, Mr. President.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2533s)

And it's actually quite clever propaganda to get them, yeah, thinking that he's reading this, this like...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2540s)

Yeah, no, dude. So the Brethren all believe that he's reading this. Of course, he never even sees it, never even gets to his desk. He's never heard of these weirdos. But the illusion inside is that the Brethren are actually running the world and everything hangs on them. Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2557s)

The thing is, they're, um, they're super rich and everything, but they're not that clever. Like they obviously have no media training, right? Like the way they treated you when you went to try and get in and then a lawsuit, like threatened a lawsuit the next day. Like did they not realize that that's like to a journalist, that's like, oh dang, I got something. I got a fish. You know what you wanted them to do. Yeah, exactly. But it's, they have no sense of that. So they, they just cut [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2587s) cut off...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2587s)

Yeah, can I just interject here? And I don't want to, you know, blow smoke into the Brethren, uh, propaganda at all. But as ridiculous as it sounds, they did meet with John Howard and exchange letters with him and lobby him to some success and and visit him in his office on a busy day during the election campaign in 2004\. So, sorry, 2007\.

So as ridiculous as it sounds, Bruce Hales did correspond with John Howard. And I've got the letters.

And they are offering him advice.

For example, they were offering him advice on water policy, which during the drought in Australia was quite a big thing.

They told him they were praying for him.

Now, I did talk to a Howard staff member when I was writing the book and he said that the Prime Minister had seen them as a constituency, as that was a constituent matter as opposed to an official prime ministerial matter. But the fact was that Bruce Hales, Stephen Hales and others, I think, um, um, Mark McKenzie trooped into his Parliament House office during the lead up to the election in 2007 and met him. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2688s) a story leaked to me by Tony McCorkell, who was also there. Um, but but, uh, you know, um, and they donate. They donate to the Liberal Party. And in politics, money talks, they donate under the radar and they lobby. And so when they were trying to set up their school system in Australia in the 90s, I think, and they had [–](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2718s) and Australia's got a bit of a strange education system where the government provides significant funding to private schools, private and religious schools.

They wanted their cut of this funding and were lobbying for it and sent a letter to the education minister, sorry, to the prime minister, John Howard, who sent it on to the education minister with a note on top from the minister's office saying, you know, known to PM. In other words, these people, we know these guys, give them a hearing. And they got for their Sydney school one of the most generous funding packages that was in [existence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2760s) that was akin to, you know, the kind of emergency level funding you give to special schools and, you know, schools in remote areas and that kind of thing. So I wouldn't, you know, while it sounds laughable that they might in fact have had the ear of President George Bush or or that that these people consult them on tricky global issues and that kind of thing.

They did in Australia, at least for that period, genuinely have a relationship with the Australian Prime Minister, who George Bush described as a man of steel and who took them into Iraq. And, you know, one of the letters congratulates Mr. Howard on his actions in the Middle East and so forth. So I'm not suggesting that he consulted them. I'm not suggesting for a moment that he consulted them on Iraq policy. I think that would be ridiculous. Nevertheless, um, you know, they they were in his ear [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2813s) it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2814s)

Absolutely. And do you think there's been a a change in the motivation for these political connections? Because back in 2005, 2006, it was about issues like family court issues and gay marriage and being more military and but, well, of course, what we've seen in the UK, sort of stunning story breaking at the moment is leveraging all those political connections for financial gain. How has it kind of segued from one end to the other? What point did that start to happen, do you think?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D2851s)

Well, I'm told, and perhaps you guys can confirm this, that Bruce Hales now refers to himself as the CEO. Oh yes, absolutely, yeah, I've got that in print.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2867s)

And I've heard the word community a lot recently, so they call them like people that are in the community, out of the community. When I was in, community wasn't a big word, like they weren't like, oh, we're the community.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2876s)

Oh, ecosystem is the other one, isn't it? Ah, yeah, ecosystems. Well, do they use that themselves? Oh, yes, very much.

Extensively, yeah. It's actually a very good word to describe what they've done. And that kind of, I mean, I wrote in 2008 about the system. There's a chapter in my book called The System, which the Hales brothers tried to bring in under JT Jr. and got them in a lot of trouble. And that that generated the "no commerce in the assembly" line from John [Taylor,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2916s) um, but by the mid-2000s, they were starting to institute this, what had back back then been called the system, all over again. And McCorkell told me that Hales had boasted to him that, um, we're doing it again, but this time it's much better and it's going to work. And he was right. Um, you know, they've got, I don't know that I can't, I mean, National Office Assist, you know, [morphed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2946s) into Unispace, morphed into something else, OneSchool, UBT, they've got, you know, they've got the big buying group, they've got the big consulting group, they've got access now to everyone's accounts through UBT. Um, you know, they are in essence running the kind of totalitarian, horrifying, satisfying sort of 100% big brother oversight that they were hoping to get. Back in the day, the system involved people, [children,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2977s) families being issued with time sheets where they had to account for their day in six-minute increments like a lawyer does.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=2986s)

It's interesting, yes, that in your book, like those 15 minute little gaps, because I remember my father bringing it back in in the early 2000s and was like, oh, this is the new thing. And it was like he was breaking down his day and it was all because of the Bruce Hales resurgent of this, this knowing what you're doing like every little bit of the day. And I'm like, that's insanely unhealthy.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3010s)

Yeah, well, they have to do that anymore because they've got Streamline 3\.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3014s)

Um, Bruce Hales has said, uh, as recently as about four or five years ago that the system should never have stopped. That's, that's his latest thing he's been saying. Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3027s)

Yeah, sorry. All the corners the Lord turns, he keeps turning corners and, yeah, you know, he's like an F1 driver.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3035s)

I'm sorry, I'm being kicked out of this room. I'm at the office at the moment, so I will, uh, walk and talk. Talk among yourselves. All right.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3050s)

Well, they've got, I've got some insider, you know, news telling me, um, how these people, the the women are spending all day working for, um, the Co-op food stores, Campus, like their...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3069s)

Campus and, yeah, Campus...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3071s)

And Co, there it is, Campus and Co. There, the women are spending their entire day all week pretty much working hard hours for this grocery store that doesn't pay them for all this work. They're doing it volunteering and they're spending time away from their families and all this stuff and not getting a penny for it. It's so disgusting.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3095s)

Well, and to make it worse, what they're doing is taking the tax deduction for the volunteer hours. So they get free labor and then they take the tax deduction for the volunteer hours.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3106s)

Have you heard about this, Michael?

I've certainly heard about it. Campus and Co. Yeah, Campus and Co. Look, yeah, there is a lot. There is a lot.

I mean, tax is another fascinating issue. I mean, I find the doctrine "spoiling the Egyptians" is, you know, a nice big umbrella to justify all sorts of quite bad behaviour. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3136s)

So you talked about the little time sheets and he's gone into COVID documentation. And every Sunday you are emailed a document and you have to go through your household and you have to check off if they've been COVID vaccinated or if they're not COVID vaccinated. And if there's anybody in your household that has not been vaccinated, they're not allowed in any of the assembly halls or Campus and Co or in the school. And that has to be filled [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3166s) between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. or you get a phone call and they chase down this document. And it's a once a week thing and I've seen it, so it's not a story. In fact, I have a copy of it.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3180s)

Oh, we believe you, Carman, but keep getting this feeling like this guy is not clever enough to make this shit up on his own. Someone is feeding him this shit. Where is he getting these ideas to do this kind of insane crap?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3195s)

Well, Mein Kampf is probably a good start.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3200s)

Right? Like COVID check-in forms? And how many times do you have to say you've been vaccinated? You have to confirm it every week?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D3207s)

And if you have guests staying with you, if you have guests staying with you, they have to be listed on your form for the week so that he knows where the guests are traveling and that way he can keep track of who's going where.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3221s)

Yeah. Yeah. You know, they say in there that like God watches everything, right? Watches everything you do all the time. And it's like, really, no, it's Bruce Hales that wants to watch everything you're doing all the time, not God. It's him. They want your phone tracked. They want your internet watched, your emails. They don't want you to read books that might make you realize that it's all bullshit. They are just controlling absolutely everything. And checking in weekly. [See,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3252s) I'm reading 1984 right now by George Orwell for the first time, and my mind's like blown. I'm like, oh my god, you know, this is, this is the church. This is the Plymouth Brethren, right?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3265s)

Your head's gonna explode, Lane. Your head's gonna explode.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D3267s)

I'm only a couple chapters in, I know. Sorry, Mike. Yeah. So if you're listening, Brethren members, go out and buy the book called 1984 by George Orwell. Absolutely awesome. Yeah. Oh, sorry, Michael, you plug your book first.

You've got to plug your book and you have a picture, Carman, you can, you can hold it up, you can show the, uh, the cover of it there. Amazing book. I just finished it. Oh, so good. Behind the Exclusive Brethren.

Can you tell us what was the inspiration for the dollar and the Jesus?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3302s)

Well, it's actually hard to illustrate a book about the Exclusive Brethren because they themselves are so, um, colorless, um, and because of the initial, the initial, um, idea came back, and this is the, I've had to knock this aside on a couple of, uh, of my stories as well when we're trying to find an illustration of the crucifix, um, you know, illustrating it. And the initial idea was it was of a crucifix. And I [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3332s) of said, well, I just don't really use that. It's not, that's kind of a, that's not really a symbol, that's not really their thing. Um, and so, uh, the publisher said, well, what is their thing? And I said, well, money, money's their thing. And, uh, so hence the, uh, the dollar coin.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3349s)

Yeah, that's awesome.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3351s)

Um, but look, you know, I mean, I think that book, you know, in some respects, that book is showing its age. It's, uh, you know, we're still talking about the attempts, ultimately successful, to shut down Pebsnet. And then, you know, Facebook comes along and gives, you know, gives an unshutdownable forum for people to contribute to.

But in other respects, I think it holds, you know, and obviously the lobbying around schooling and that kind of stuff, it's quite Australia focused.

But in other respects, you know, things haven't changed the way they treat people. The system has only got more extreme.

The ability to both reap as much money as you possibly can from any possible social welfare system or handout or government contract that you can get your hands on at the same time as amassing millions and millions and millions of dollars in the coffers of the leadership.

You know, a lot of that hasn't changed. It just got worse. Well, it's got more systematic, and it's enabled by technology, actually.

And unlike you, Lane, I've never thought Bruce Hales or his family or the leadership group there are dumb. I think they are very, very smart and very crafty and very focused. And their focus, and I would say that around the time I was writing that book or probably even before actually, their focus changed from being a religion to being a business in the guise of a religion. And I think that's what they are. And they are, on any measure you choose, any measure, they are an incredibly successful business. They would be, if you amassed the kind of the Hales dynasty and put it all together, I think that would be one of the the big, the biggest companies certainly in Australia.

Um, but yeah, nobody's ever done that.

I mean, they're charity, they've got charities worth hundreds of millions of dollars, charities. I mean, I'd like to compare that to say Oxfam or or a charity that actually does some good in the world.

Yeah. They'd be bigger, I think. Serving a group of, what, 50,000 people. Yeah. But it's self-serving, isn't it? I mean, it's like 2% of what they actually get charitable tax relief on that goes outside of the organization. And that 2% validates tax relief on the whole of the rest of it on the 98 percent. Um...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3520s)

I guess the only satisfaction I get is is, okay, he's smart enough to make money, but he's not smart enough to go and live a good life. He and and and leave the Brethren, right? Like I, he's still tied to it. So as rich as they get, you know, they're not smart enough to realize that they're literally just making their own prison cell nicer and nicer and nicer. Yeah.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3544s)

I wonder though, are the leadership in prison or is it just the people who follow them?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3551s)

That's, that's a good point. That's a good point.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3553s)

I mean, we did track, Bruce Hales feels like God. He, you know, the Hales name, like he said in that letter to, um, Bob Thorncroft, that the Hales name is going to become great again. Um, he's treated like a god in there. He walks into the room and people stand up and he, he's unreachable, untouchable. And I think that's what he wants. He's where he wants to be. Um, he's got fame.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D3578s)

I mean, we did track 50,000 people though, fame from 50,000 people, one big soccer game. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Nobody else cares.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3587s)

We did track his jet and it visited Las Vegas for a night and then it went on to a resort in Costa Rica. So I do wonder how much they are really in prison, Lane. I mean, what they would, the local brethren be told of business trips and maybe anything, but yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3607s)

So maybe they're just all breaking the rules now and making the poor suckers at the bottom of the rung follow.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3613s)

I'm sure that's what they're doing. Yeah.

Michael, have you got more? Did you finish your stories you had in mind?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D3621s)

I think that's, that's about it. I mean, I, you know, I do find it endlessly fascinating the extent to which the worldly authorities from tax officers to charities commissions to governments to courts to police both are either turn a blind eye or don't have the guts to follow up as the charities commission in the UK to follow up on their decisions, um, and to allow, they could, they could not survive. The Exclusive Brethren could not survive. The Exclusive Brethren, one, uh, one former member described them to me as a tumor, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3676s) they may, they, they, they are sucking the lifeblood out of the host, but they can't survive without the host. And the host is society. Yeah, a parasite. The host is the world. Um, you know, we give them religious freedom, as we should, um, although I, I do have something to say about that. We give them, um, you know, laws with within which to conduct their business. Uh, we give them charity [exemptions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3707s) We give them, uh, courts that are willing to enforce their rights. We give them social welfare, which they milk for all it's worth, if they can get away with it. We give them a tax system that allows them to, you know, certainly in Australia, to run their businesses through trusts and make tax-free donations to schools, which sets up a tax-free network of, you know, money circulating through the Brethren system. So we, society, give them all that. And in return, they give us hatred and separation and exploitation of former members of [our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3752s) systems. So it's not that great a deal.

And the other thing the world gives them is ignorance. They do fly under the radar. As you say, Lane, you know, there's a small, there's a half empty MCG, Melbourne Cricket Ground crowd of people globally that follow them, which is enough to boost them up in their own eyes, but not enough to fill a stadium.

And nobody really knows very much about them. Yeah. So that's a pretty unfair deal, I reckon, for the taxpayers of our countries and the world in general.

Um, and and yet, uh, and yet they hate us for it. So, um, yeah, I find them pretty odious, I've got to say.

Um...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3802s)

Yeah, it could be summed up in their, their contempt. They've just got content for the world and it could be summed up in Bruce Hales' his own words. He said about getting the money off the world because it all belongs to us anyway. He said it all belongs to us, so we, we can get it off them.

Um, they've just got content for themselves.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3823s)

And and it's so dumb because if you just have a conversation with them, I would just say, can you please point to what is the world? Where is it exactly? What is the world? What is it? It's a made-up concept in their mind, completely fabricated fantasy. It's like, oh, Peter Pan has this place I can't visit.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3845s)

You know, and the other thing is, because of their refusal to accept post-secondary education, they're contributing no inventors, no scientists, no musicians, no lawyers, no doctors, no nurses, no school teachers, no educators to society. All that they have to take from society. And yet they put nothing back. All they put back into the world is businessmen and accountants and women who are basically slaves.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3875s)

They become obsessed with business.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3877s)

And damaged, damaged people, the people who who emerge from them damaged and grief-stricken and, uh, you know, often needing years of therapy or whatever else to to kind of to get by. Yeah, many of those people, many of those people have great lives. I mean, I'm talking to a bunch of them, uh, and and there are many, many who have terrific lives and have have no regrets whatsoever and are big contributors to society and all the rest of it. But you know, that's on those individuals and society. It's not on the Brethren. The Brethren didn't do that.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3914s)

No.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3915s)

Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3918s)

Um, did you want to say anything more, Michael, about Tony McCorkell's, um, last little while and how the Brethren tried to give them harsh money? It's all in the public domain anyway. Yes.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3931s)

Yes, no, thanks for, thanks for the reminder, Peter. I did want to talk about that.

So when we were being sued by the Brethren for defamation and in the Jane Doe case, probably our best – it was hard to call any of the people who had been abused to give evidence for us because obviously they didn't want to be identified and they were damaged people.

And so probably our best witness was going to be Tony McCorkell. And they realized this as well. And so they approached him shortly actually before they lodged their defamation suit. And three days after they first lodged their defamation suit against us, three days, they signed a deed of service, and they called a deed of confidentiality and service agreement with Tony McCorkell, which runs to about sort of 15 pages, but the [import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=3991s) of it is two things. You cannot talk to anybody who is named – you cannot talk about anything you learned during your period working with and under the Brethren with anybody named in Schedule 3 of this agreement. There is one name in Schedule 3 of the agreement, Michael Bachelard.

The second thing was you are not allowed to, and it's a very convoluted clause, which actually can't be enforced, but the purport of the clause is to bar him from giving evidence in a court about anything he learned. Now, in return for that, they offered him $920,000 to be paid out over 10 years. So they were buying his silence for a [decade.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4044s)

He signed that agreement. And then he decided that that wasn't quite good enough. Now, Tony was only in his 30s. He was a very unhealthy man. And his business was in a lot of trouble because he was a grifter and a terrible businessman.

And so he went back to them.

And he said, I want to renegotiate this. And I want the money now.

Now, another Melbourne-based elder's name was on the deed.

And he would tell me, I'm going to meet in a bar. I'm a bit scared. He scares me.

And then, so we're still having these conversations right through this period until he signs the deed and then he just goes quiet.

But long story short, he renegotiated the $920,000 down to two payments of $240,000. $175,000 up front.

And so I have the deed. I don't have the renegotiated deed, but I do have copies of the transactions going into his bank account. So I can see that he's paid this money. And I can see also that he's paid, that he sent text messages to a friend of his saying, oh, I'm at the meeting, you know, they're going to pay up, it should land this afternoon, that kind of thing. So it's an open and shut case. They bribed him [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4133s) be quiet. And it wasn't, and he did. He then subsequently refused to give evidence for us, which is one of the reasons we walked away, because, you know, it was going to be difficult for us to prove in Australia's punishing defamation thing law that we had told the truth about this because our witnesses had either been intimidated away or bought off.

And that actually was not the first time they tried to bribe me to stop writing about them. In the early days, they'd offered me a fully paid trip to Nouméa with my family, if I would stop writing about them. I politely declined that offer.

And then a little bit later on, after I'd written a story about Braden Simmons, who I know has been a guest on your podcast, and about the terrible things Bruce Hales had said about him in ministry, that he should take rat poison and kill himself.

After I'd written that, they approached McCorkell again and said, they would pay me a six-figure sum to stop writing about them. And if he could convince me to do that, that they'd pay him the same sum.

He told them that that was a bad idea because I would probably see that as a, you know, an attempt to buy me off and that that would offend my ethical principles. And they took that advice and didn't in fact make the offer, but he told me about it and I've seen the emails that are exchanged between them. So you know, it seems like they judge other people by their own standards. You know, not having ethical principles themselves, they were amazed to find that a journalist might...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4240s)

That's right.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4240s)

And and and and the final, the final offer of payment was that, so part of my ethics is that before I published the sex abuse story, I had to go to them to seek comment. So they knew it was coming. Um, so they went and and, uh, and I think McCorkell, because he was a grifter, was talking to them at the same time as he was talking to me. And he had sent them a copy of my of my draft story, thanks Tony, uh, which which [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4270s) elicited a whole bunch of threats. And also, uh, they went to him and offered him $65,000 to basically say that I'd made it all up and disavowing the quotes from him that were in the story and that I'd coerced him into giving the interview and he'd been quoted out of context.

So they made that offer to him pre-publication, basically, so that even if it was published, that it would land without any supporters. And McCorkell at that time was on my side and in fact wanted to publish that fact. We decided not to and that that payment was never made.

But you know, I mean, I don't know how you deal with a group like that, um, except to just call them out within the, within what the law allows. Um, so I wrote all that up into a story after the defamation suit had been settled and everything. I wrote all that up into a story and laid it out line by line, what I'd been offered, what he'd been offered, um, and what had ultimately happened. And I didn't hear a peep from them. They didn't even threaten defamation over that. They just were completely silent, which I think is probably the first story I've written about them that hasn't elicited some kind of threat.

So, and then, and Tony McCorkell died. He died. He, age 37, he died. Now, I'm asked often by former Brethren, what did he die of? I've described it as natural causes. And I believe that to be the case.

I can't guarantee he wasn't sort of slowly poisoned over six months or a year.

But I don't think that's the case. I think he drank like a fish. I mean, I met him in a cafe at 11 o'clock one morning and he said, let's have a whiskey instead of a coffee.

You know, he drank, he was morbidly obese, he was about six foot seven, he was a huge man, and he was always, or he like when you would shake his hand and it was like, it was like trying to get, wrap your hand, I've got a reasonably big hand, it was like trying to wrap your fingers around a side of beef and it was always wet and sweaty. He was always sweaty. Like he was a deeply, deeply unhealthy man. He had diabetes, um, you know, and I, you know, I would in conversations with him over about six months, he'd say, I'm feeling really, really bad. Uh, he said, I coughed up blood this morning. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4440s) I said, mate, you've got to go to a doctor. And he said, I don't want to go to a doctor because I'm afraid of what they'll tell me. Um, and, uh, you know, in one of the text messages when he's receiving this money, actually, I made a mistake earlier, I said it was $275,000 times two, it was actually $175,000 times two, and that's in Australian dollars. So, um, just to correct that. Um, he, uh, uh, he said, you know, in in one of these text messages, friend, I've just, [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4470s) just had a vomit, you know, uh, he was a very unhealthy man, even though he was young. So I do believe, I don't believe there was any, um, you know, foul play there. But but I do, I mean, having seen the stuff in the Klondike Papers, Richard, and and the things that happened to you, uh, that's not to say I don't think, um, that that certain individuals might not be capable of, uh, of doing terrible things in the in the name of the [Brethren.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4500s) I just don't believe, and I've certainly got no evidence, and I'm a journalist who wants to have evidence, that there was any foul play in his death.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4506s)

No. I mean, one thing that did turn up that was very interesting is that Brad Mitchell, who was the guy who was pursuing me, contacted David Wallace looking for enforcers to collect a debt in Texas. David Wallace put him in touch with a former Hell's Angel boss and they were seriously, and Brad Mitchell was seriously thinking this guy could go in and collect the money for him. The Hell's Angel boss said, look, it's not the wild west anymore, you need a lawyer, you don't need an enforcer. So it's in their head that they can do this stuff. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4548s) part of the god complex. Um, and yeah, we got the, we got the correspondence to prove it. I mean, it's not and and but you mentioned...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4557s)

in the book too, like a couple times, I think, how they think they're the highest court in the land, right? They're above any law. And that's the scary part because that gives them this carte blanche to, oh, we're doing it in the name of the church. It's this right, it's this righteous court order. It's like a court order to them. Yeah.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4573s)

Yeah, yeah. And that that authorizes them to tell, you know, a 12 year old girl who's been repeatedly abused sexually that if she goes to the court, well, her mother actually, that if if she takes it to the police and reports it, that it's, you know, um, that she may as well hang a millstone around stone around her neck...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4596s)

Yeah.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4597s)

and and jump in the river, you know.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4599s)

Kill yourself. Like that's evil.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4601s)

Yeah, yep. Because because, you know, this this court where it's decided here, that's the end of it. Um, so don't go to the police. That is a classic cover-up. I'm sorry, that is a classic cover-up. Um, and, uh, you know, they've been, they've, they have been and and still do it. And I mean, I said this in current cases that when you try and look into what the Brethren's motivations are in all their court [maneuvers,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4631s) it's always about their reputation. They don't give a damn for the human beings involved, either the ones inside or the ones outside. The only thing they're concerned about is not having any more negative publicity.

Because you can't be the...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4649s)

one chosen church by the creator of the entire universe if you're not a great, perfect church, right? So everything just has to keep this image perfect because we're the one chosen church, right? It's like...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4662s)

That's not how law works.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4663s)

That's partly why Richard's case is, because they had to maintain their reputation.

Um, they don't like whistleblowers.

Clearly.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4676s)

Yeah, sounds like you might be in for an offer to come and to shut down, uh, Get-A-Life podcast.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4684s)

I mean, I think they might...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4687s)

come along, offer you five thousand dollars...

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4690s)

holiday in Hawaii.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4692s)

Actually, since that Tony McCorkell bribe case blew, I haven't heard of them ever trying to bribe anyone since then. I think they got their fingers badly burnt and they said, okay, no more bribery, we're just going to go with intimidation and lawsuits. But is that the case, Michael? Have you heard of any other cases since you blew that one open?

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4711s)

Um, I haven't really looked, but no, no, I kind of think there was a change of policy there. I mean, they [do,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4721s) uh, interestingly, after like after I was sued for defamation, there was a little bit of a kind of mini sort of flurry of defamation suits that went around and against, there was a former member, I don't want to name her because I don't know if she would like me to, but a former member got sued for, yes, for something she'd said or written somewhere about her story. And and they all sort of disappeared at the same time, which is what makes me think that they were related [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4751s) the, um, the Laurie Moffitt case and so on.

Yes. I mean, I think they, I I have no hesitation in saying I'm sure they bribe politicians and the police and and judiciary and all these areas of government. But in terms of dealing with critics, I think they've moved away from the pay people to shut up plan to just clobber them with everything the law can throw at them and and a few other things [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4781s) well, as far as I can see.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4783s)

Well, it's a waste of time, it's like whack-a-mole, it's gonna come up again somewhere else.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4789s)

Yeah, that may well be the case. Yeah.

**Richard Marsh**

Talking about some, you know, we're talking about some very dark things here. So could we ask you a little bit about Dr. Roger Kirkpatrick, who we understand has recently passed away.

You had a story about him, Michael.

**Michael Bachelard**

Yes, I believe him to have been a child sex abuser.

Um, the one of the stories that I, that was included in that child sex abuse story was of a woman who as a little girl had been, um, uh, had an asthma attack and, uh, was taken by her parents to Dr. Kirkpatrick's home for treatment.

Now, for those who don't know, he was one of two, only two doctors in the Brethren in Australia because they had been trained as doctors before the prohibition on university going had been enforced. So he and Dr. Mark Craddock were the two in Australia, and they had a lot of work putting antidepressant prescriptions on faxes and sending them around the countryside and that kind of thing. And in Mark Craddock's case, prescribing prostate cancer drugs to a gay man, Craig Hoyle, to reduce his libido.

In Kirkpatrick's case, this little girl, and this would have been back in the maybe the 60s or 70s, was taken to his house suffering asthma. He tucked her up in bed, stayed with her all night, and then in her words, did some things to her that he shouldn't have and that he sexually abused her. Now, she didn't want to, and I didn't press her to go into details, but she was decades later [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4916s) traumatised by that, but also particularly by her father's denial of it because she told her father and her father went to Dr. Kirkpatrick, who was a leader in the local community and a respected elder, and said, this happened. And he went to him and Roger denied it. And he came back to her and said, you're lying. Dr. Kirkpatrick's denied it and I believe him. And she had lifelong trauma from that and was one of the sources for that story. But of course, I couldn't prove that. He had given her some kind of injection and her recollection was a bit confused. Um, I couldn't, so I couldn't [name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=4963s) him in that story and the only reason I'm naming him now is because I'm reliably assured that he's dead and he can't sue me because otherwise in Australia he could.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D4972s)

He was very prominent, you know, right right to the end because he was, I think he was John Hales' cousin. So as a family member and he was used, he would go around the world taking three-day meetings. I mean, ironically, the one, well, I mean, I went to Maple Creek many times, but one of the occasions was a fellowship meeting taken by Dr. Roger Kirkpatrick. And I spoke to him there. So there you have the [Hales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5008s) administration sending a child sex abuser to minister in Maple Creek, which is kind of, you know, child sex abuse 101 in Canada in the Brethren. Um, and and it's just horrific, the the irony of it. So I, uh, I'm very much doubt it helps them much.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5027s)

Yeah, I met Dr. Kirkpatrick when I was 14 in Australia. My parents took me to him because I had problems but they didn't know what and no doctor would diagnose me with anything. Um, so he sat down and he said, and my parents are sitting next to me and he's across from me and says, oh, I've heard you have anger problems. And immediately in my head, I was like, I didn't think I did, but I started getting a little mad. And then he's like, I bet I could say something to you right now and you'd want to come [across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5057s) that table and punch me in the face. And instantly, I wanted to punch him in the fucking face. It was weird. I hated him from from that second on. Like he would just that, the way he'd never said, hello, how are you? Sit down, nothing. That was what he said. You have anger problem? I could say something that make you want to come across and punch me. And I was like, that was it. You just said it.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5081s)

He was a psychologist or psychiatrist. I mean, that was his field of study, which I suspect the Hales has found very useful because, I mean, the art of managing a crowd of people or influencing a crowd of people, it comes down to psychology.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYHmQAXJs2k0%26t%3D5096s)

Yeah, maybe that's where he was getting some of his crazy ideas.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5102s)

I mean, when I was shut up and I had to live in my business premises for, I think I was there for four months, I became suicidal.

I told the Brethren, I told my priests, look, I'm suicidal. Get me some help. And they sent off all my case notes to Roger Kirkpatrick. And about three weeks later, he sent an email back. So I said, you know, let's see the email. And my brother, who was in the Brethren, also said to the priest, let's see the email. And oh, no, I can't, I can't let you see the email because we've got to protect Dr. Kirkpatrick. So I don't know what it was, what the [email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5143s) said, but I was then sent to the Mayo Clinic to one of their, you know, one of these psychologists that they have in their pocket there, um, that just, you know, that treats all the Brethren cases. And he interviewed me and recommended that I should have electric shock treatment, which, oh my God. But I, I kind of suspect that that was what Kirkpatrick had suggested for me.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5168s)

The fact that you reported being suicidal and they didn't respond to you for three weeks is astounding and terrifying and terrible. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5184s)

Wow. And I, and yeah, on that note, I think Michael probably has to get back to work.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5193s)

I do have a few things to do. It's been amazing. Thank you so much for coming on.

**Lane Admiraal**

Yeah, Michael, we really appreciate it. There was a brilliant, that's a brilliant podcast. It's gonna get it, it's going to get great ratings. Um, and and you've told us so much new stuff that, you know, hasn't been out there or if it has, it's been lost and forgotten. So this is a real wake-up call for everyone. So yeah, really appreciate it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5217s)

You have a standing invitation whenever you want to break something, you just holler.

### [**Michael Bachelard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmQAXJs2k0&t=5223s)

Thank you. Well, uh, yes, I'm, I will be at some point looking for case studies. So...

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
