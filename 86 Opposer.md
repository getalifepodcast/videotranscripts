## Summary

Leave the brethren and stay silent, and you are not allowed a meaningful relationship with family in the brethren. Leave the brethren and speak out, and you are not allowed a meaningful relationship with family in the brethren. It seems to make no significant difference.
It does seem, however, that speaking out publicly results in having the added label of being an ‘opposer’ and the brethren pray for your ‘removal’ because of the ‘poison’ we speak.
What is an opposer? Why are we labeled as such? How is this label fueled among the brethren? What are our motivations for speaking out on a public forum? Lindy Jacomb joins the UK team to unpack this label and the implications of it. Join us as we delve into the brethren mindset towards ‘opposers’ and discuss the real fears the brethren hold towards speaking to such people.
Take heart as we explain our motives for having public conversations about the brethren and share the emotion at the end when Lindy reads a poem about how it feels to be regarded as an opposer by those you love.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with Abi and Ross and Gilli and Lindy Jacomb has joined us once again. And we thought we'd have a chat around about this expression “opposers” and opponents of the truth, which is something we are often all classed as. And we thought we'd just have a discussion and delve into what exactly an opposer means, why we do what we do and is it [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=36s) wrong to actually be opposed of something that we believe not to be right.

So I thought I'd start just by having some dictionary definitions of what is an opposer just for discussion and the first one I came up with is someone who offers opposition, well that's probably a fairly obvious definition. There was another one to act against or provide resistance to things you're not happy with. The one that I thought was most interesting [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=66s) a dictionary definition that was to vigorously oppose tyranny in every form. I thought that was an interesting one and then we also had an opposer is someone who disagrees with something or someone, often by speaking or fighting against it. And this is exactly where the brethren have issues with us. So I thought I'd just throw that out there for people's thoughts on what is an opposer, why are we classed as such?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=92s)

One reason why we're classed as opposers is because we've left the truth and the life, the light. So therefore we're the lowest of the low really. That's partly my interpretation of it and about others.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=112s)

The other thing I thought would be quite interesting to start this off was to think about how when we were in the Brethren did we view those who left. Now when I was in the Brethren the internet wasn't around so the opportunity to speak out against them perhaps wasn't as liberal as it is now, and I had very little knowledge of any press articles or anything that came out because the ability to distribute them wasn't quite the same. But how did the four of you who all left far more recently than me [view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=143s) somebody that left out and was perhaps that left the brethren and was perhaps known to be in opposition to the position or the brethren?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=156s)

Staying quiet on that one.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=162s)

Yeah, we thought they were really, really evil. But I mean you might have already said this but there's a difference between people who just leave and who quietly fall off the back of the bandwagon and who never speak up. Everyone doesn't mind people as much because obviously they don't pose any sort of threat to the brethren whereas it's those who actually decide to speak up. And I liked how your dictionary definition was [focused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=192s) on things like, yeah that one that said about speaking up against tyranny.

Because I think most of us ex-brethren who do choose to speak up, it comes only after a lot of wrestling and a lot of realizing that actually there's some significant injustices going on here and if we don't speak up who will. And so, so yeah there are two sort of tiers to people who leave the brethren. There's just those who leave and [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=223s) get on with looking after their own lives and trying to recover themselves. And then there are those of us who come to a point and it's usually for you know one or two very definite reasons why we do it, and we can maybe get more into that later that could be an interesting thing to explore around what motivates us. But it's yeah it's only really those who become the opposers, so [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=253s).

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=253s)

But when you're in the brethren do you think that though you're in the brethren, those who are known opposers are they viewed differently to those… In other words what I'm trying to get at here is if you were in the brethren and you had a member of your family who had left but they went quietly and they never spoke out against what they believed to be wrong amongst the brethren, they kept it all to themselves and they gave no trouble, do you think their contact with their [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=284s) would be not as encouraged as those of us that do speak out?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=288s)

Absolutely, because I can see it with people that I know that have left, even recently, like the difference between them and us is just poles apart. Like no one will even speak to us which I'm fine with, but it was I wasn't fine with it at first it's really painful. And then when I [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=318s) to do with the or help people that leave and see how their families are still communicating with them and looking after their children and, you know ringing up every day to see how you are I'm just like wow.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=337s)

I concur with that because I've got a friend in New Zealand and they have a lot of contact with their family and yet I don't really have any at all. If any contact's made it's me that makes the contact, it doesn't come from the other side.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=352s)

It does depend on the family I think because for many years after leaving I did not speak up for, to my recollection, around about a decade. And that was because I was afraid of repercussions from my family because I was trying to see them and so I would like turn down journalists who wanted to talk and things like that. And that's my recollection of it and then for me it finally reached a point [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=383s) I realized that no matter what I do and how quiet I am my family still will not communicate with me.

So I think that but I think that my family was particularly devoted to the brethren and particularly devoted to the principles of separation so it might depend a little bit on that. Because yeah obviously now that I've started to speak up more in the last few years and there's reasons for that, now I know that they'll [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=413s) viewing me as even worse. But yeah what I'm trying to say is that from my perspective especially in my first few years out, yeah I wasn't being an active opposer and yet my all of my siblings and family members and relatives still completely cut me off. So it might depend on how devoted the family member is to the party line into the brethren system.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=436s)

I think you've got a good point there actually Lindy because my family was exactly the same. Like yourself I didn't speak up, I've been out nearly 10 years now and it's only during the last year that I've spoken up and that was really literally because I wasn't having any contact with my family anyway. So I felt and I was the same I did do one, I mean I think I put my foot in it a bit because I did take part in a newspaper [article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=466s) that went out but there was literally only about two or three lines in the article that referred to me really. But there hadn't been any contact before that and there was certainly no contact after that so in the end I just thought well I've got nothing to lose I might as well you know start speaking out.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=487s)

Maybe it was a bit different with me because I started speaking up inside of there so they were obviously like she's on the way out. 

**Jacky Hart**

You were doomed before you came out, Abi.

**Abi Thompson**

 I know, right?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=501s)

Yeah, it's interesting because I remember because I wasn't actually withdrawn from until two years after I left and there was a guy who had been, I'd been very close to. He'd done a lot, you know, when I was in the peebs he looked after me a lot and was very, very close to him. And in those first couple of years he kept, you know, he kept in touch, not like, you know, as much as he ever did, but he was happy to keep in touch.

And it wasn't until that he heard via the grapevine that I'd passed comment about Bruce Hales. The minute he heard that he contacted me and said, no, [if,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=549s) if you're going to make comments like that, that's where the, that's where the line is drawn. I can't have you making comments like that and keeping contact with you. And that was my experience, which I just thought, you know, he's been happy to keep in touch for the last couple of years. You know, knowing where I stood in that sense. I'd made it clear to him about how I felt, but it wasn't until that I actually heard that I'd made comments then.

But it's interesting you're saying about families because I remember again I probably probably within the first six months I guess I mentioned to that a mom that I was talking to family members who were outside and they passed comments saying something about, obviously you know you shouldn't be talking to those who have left and all the rest of it. And they sort of pass comment you know well, as long as they're not against the brethren.

I didn't have the heart to tell them that the family member I was talking to hadn’t got an ounce of time for the brethren at all. Again it was that thing of as long as you're not [slating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=631s) us then we're happy for you to stay in touch with them and and likewise for us to stay in touch with you, but it's the moment it's the moment you start vocalizing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=643s)

So my experience was similar to yours in that I didn't do anything or say anything for the best part of 25, 26, 27 years. It wasn't, I only had one immediate member of my family in so I was fortunate enough to have the majority of my immediate family with me. And not so long back my brother has actually told me that he doesn't want to have anything to do with me while I'm so opposed to the position [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=673s) I accept.

But what upsets me is he won't have anything to do with my parents who have never ever spoken out or said anything. But when I took issue with that it kind of got turned back and it was all on me and what it led me to think about was what is it they're so afraid of. So we know don't we that Bruce Hales often says in ministry because we've heard insiders tell us that he talks in his meetings [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=704s) opposers and the wickedness of having contact with opposers.

What is it that they're so frightened of? Because my biggest, biggest wish would be the leaders of the brethren would just sit down and talk to us. You know you wouldn't get cross with them you wouldn't but they just sit down and talk to us but they won't do that. So what is it that they're trying to instill, what is it they're frightened of?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=731s)

Cult tactics isn't it, proper cult tactics I think so yeah. It's putting the people in fear by using very bold statements about those that have left. And then but actually what the people, the higher end of the hierarchy are scared of is people believing us and therefore believing our truth rather than their truth.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=764s)

I think it's that and also I think personally you know I think they're scared of the members finding out that actually we're still just the same people as we were when we were in there. Obviously not brainwashed and all the rest of it but we're still, we're still the same sons and daughters as we were when we were in there, we haven't changed.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=786s)

We're just happier.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=788s)

You know just happier and freer.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=790s)

Yeah it reminds me a little bit of the ethos of the east and west in communist Europe doesn't it where the east believed totally that the west was wicked and you don't want to go there. And then when the Berlin Wall came down they found out you know what you're actually just like us and that's what you almost wish for isn't it, that that Berlin Wall would come down.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=814s)

And I believe brethren are genuinely scared of that you know that we are just the same you know. I think I'd like to build it up and build it up where it really is opposed and all the rest of it because it keeps the fear, the flock in there and keeps them inside the inside inside really yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=835s)

And then they give ministry out about, like one of the things that they've done for a couple of years is in the back of the white books there's extracts of previous leaders ministry and one of them was loyalty to the commander. And then Bruce Hales ministers on loyalty to the commander and then it's got the previous person's ministry in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=865s) back so you've got a double whammy of being loyal to the commander, not even Jesus at this point it's to the leaders. And then you've got that rammed down your throat so then they're like if I'm not loyal to the commander then I'm one of these opposers and again it's fear. And commander I think is quite, when I think of a commander I think of like an army something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=894s)

I mean it's trying to explain to those that don't know of the brethren and to those in the brethren to maybe try and open their minds a little bit about if you like the hierarchy of where the opposers are. Lindy you did, maybe you could talk us through a sort of little show you put together that kind of explains perhaps how things are viewed from the brethren mind. I'll just put it on the screen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=924s), perhaps you could talk us through what this explains about how the brethren mindset might be towards anybody outside of themselves.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=935s)

Yeah well I was actually just looking at thinking it's got a clear, it's got a clear couple of flaws that I need to revise but anyway we can talk through those and maybe later we can share the proper version. But like the brethren have got a very particular view of themselves and of the rest of society as we know. And yeah a few years ago I drew something like this trying to describe to a friend, yeah what that's like and what are the kind of different levels.

And so obviously at the very center is Bruce Hales [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=965s) the man of God and the closer you are to the center the closer you are to God right and then you know the further out you go the closer you are to Satan. So yeah the man of God's at the center and then you've got the elders which is obviously in the brethren they might colloquially call them priests or the levitical brothers as a peeb-speak term, referring to the Levites from the old testament. But basically that you know they're the head honchos, [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=995s) Bruce's ring leaders.

And yeah so that they're kind of the next tier of holiness and then you've got the laity which is a, it's just a generally used religious term to mean the lay people or the people who aren't in religious leadership. So it's just you know Joe and Jane Bloggs who are brethren members so that's the laity. They're the ones who, like it or not, are actually propping up the whole system especially financially might we [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1025s) add.

And then you've got worldlies who are yeah the, who they don't, they try not to use that term publicly anymore but internally it was very much the term that the brethren used to describe anyone who wasn't a member.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1044s)

It's non-coms now isn't it?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1045s)

Yes these days they're trying really hard to refer to themselves as the community and those who aren't part of them as non-community members because obviously as we know they've been, you know we understand they've been taking a lot of PR advice especially around how they're perceived by the outside world. And calling people worldly does sound a bit derogatory whereas non-community is a lot more neutral. But yeah I have been told that the term worldlies are still completely understood and [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1075s) in there.

And then this is where I'm actually missing, I'm missing a concentric circle. Then there's the general outs just and and that's especially the term that's used, right? It's just outs. Or more formally, former members. And they're sort of equivalent with worldlies, although they're viewed as a bit worse than worldlies. Like, yeah, you still shouldn't really talk to an out. And then lastly, the black ring, you've got the opposers, those who are the most wicked.

So, yeah, I just thought, I drew this for a friend a few years ago and I've just slapped it together into a powerpoint now to try and use here. But for anyone who's especially not familiar with the brethren this would help you to understand [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1123s) I was trying to figure out where employees and like OneSchool Global teachers and stuff where they fit in but really they're just among generic worldlies too I think.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1133s)

But I think if you watch my episode three of my podcast it goes into this in more detail like where everyone sits on the hierarchy scale so people could have a look at that as well. But I just drew this, this is actually what it's like there's the little tiny weenie Man of God inside and then the elders and then their laity and then this is the worldlies. So this is like well how many billion people are in the world now and then what was the next one out and then opposers, like he is a tiny…that's the reality.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1182s)

But that's reality but of course they view the Man of God and the brethren as being nearly everything right, and then worldlies and the outs are just little peripheral people on the outside. I think it was Lane or someone in one of the podcasts talked about being at a football stadium and looking around and realizing that there were more people here than that were in the brethren globally and just being like what the heck we thought we were good. I mean sorry Ross go on.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1206s)

Oh it's just an aside may I say Lindy I love the way that you put the opposers in black.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1215s)

Yeah yeah there we are. I mean what I'm trying what we're trying to illustrate with that is I think for somebody who has never been in the brethren exactly what you used it for Lindy to try and describe the mindset when you're in the brethren. And I think we've all sort of demonstrated that a bit, how we viewed people that were speaking out when we were in and how it was just like talking about the devil to mention their name almost wasn't it?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1242s)

Yeah you're right you're right. I remember when at one point someone early on and leaving a known opposer here in New Zealand made contact with me and I had heard of his name I knew nothing about him but I knew that he represented pure evil you know. And when he contacted me I felt terror go through my body like I was terrified I thought there's no way I want to talk to this person. And eventually I did but I was very much like I'm keeping you at arm's length it was you know a bit like the way you might deal with a nasty spider in your house.

It's like I'm not coming near you I'm keeping you at arm's length and I'm just going to carefully remove you and put you outside of my immediate vicinity. And then when I actually did talk to him he was so lovely. It also turned out he was a really passionate christian even a very conservative christian which shocked me because at that point I still was under the impression [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1304s) a lot of people are that you cannot leave and have a faith which is connected with the opposer thing.

So we could talk about that soon but yeah I remember that sense of terror and then the contrast with meeting him and being so confused by meeting someone who was nothing like the monster that I'd been portrayed. And it's made me realize now that you guys would have all seen this but even with our work with Olive Leaf Network there are so many people who leave or who want to leave and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1334s) won't reach out to the Olive Leaf Network or they won't reach out to us because they believe that indoctrination that we are really evil and that we're going to influence them and that we hate the brethren and you know we sit around stirring witches cauldrons and building bombs whereas actually nothing could be further from the truth. Like we don't hate the brethren, we hate the tyranny.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1359s)

Yeah it's the system and and I think it's the outcome of the system. But I think it's quite good, you know, I'd want to say to anybody inside the Brethren who perhaps listens to what we're discussing, that even though we're classed as opposers for probably doing these podcasts, we do understand your mindset. We were there once. It's just that we've broken out of it. And I think that's quite important to get across. I mean, if you're watching these podcasts, you've got to have doubts [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1389s) the Brethren system anyway. Otherwise, you wouldn't watch the podcast, would you?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1393s)

Or you're just a knob that's trying to catch us out on stuff that you can sue us with.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1404s)

I'd like to say as well to anybody that's got one foot in and one foot out you won't drop down dead if you speak to us because you know we aren't bitter. We can just see you know from the outside and when you're on the outside and you can see in you can see how rotten the whole system is.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1425s)

Yeah and actually I used to be so, oh to my shame my goodness I used to be so square as they call it, and I went through like a super, not religious in a christianity sense, religious to Bruce Hales phase. And you know I would look on the ex-peeb facebook groups and I'd be like, what are these people on? And I'd go on the forums and I'd be like [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1455s) so wrong and they must be so evil.

 And then I came out and I met these beautiful people and they and they're completely different to what with my brethren hat on… Once the indoctrination's dispersed and you can actually let yourself get to know the real person it's a whole different ball game completely different ball game and actually everyone's really nice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1488s)

But what I wanted to try and touch on is I get that mindset I think we all do. So if we go back to our brethren days and how we thought then what is it that fuels that mindset? And I personally believe it's the daily feeding on the rhetoric that comes about opposers. And if you only ever listen to [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1519s) you're going to believe that. If I told a child from the day they're two years old that the leaves on the trees are purple, they would believe that because they wouldn't know any different.

But you actually do need balance. And in a sense, I think, opposers, if you think about it in a political sense, you have a government and you have an opposition. And the two just disagree on principle, which could be another story. But actually, what they do do is give an alternative viewpoint so people can make a rational decision. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1549s) that's, I think, very much what's lacking in the brethren so it is as you said earlier Abi it's that cult-like mentality whereby you keep feeding this rhetoric. You know if you talk to the opposers the terrible things are going to happen to you but it's a cul-de-sac conversation because nobody defines exactly what an opposer is, nobody defines exactly what they're opposed to. It's like rhetoric and they end up believing it, so I can understand the mindset.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1579s)

I think what changed my mindset, and it actually happened just before I left the brethren because I thought like that all of my life in the brethren, but I was going down to AA meetings in London, meeting worldly people anyway. And I actually met up with two people who the brethren class as evil if they, I mean, they did then because it was two people that had a lot to do with the [Charity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1609s) Commission matter at the time, because I left roundabout when that was all happening. And I met up with them in London and they were actually just, I mean, I wouldn't exactly call them my friends, but they're just decent, you know, decent people really. And that changed my thinking. But had I not been going down to AA meetings in London, I think when I left, I would have still had that mindset I had whilst in the Brethren.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1636s)

I think it's important to point out that, especially to those, if we're talking about people who are listening on the inside, is that we've talked about the transformation from being brainwashed to believing only what the Brethren believe. And then for those of us who have left for seeing it you know for seeing what it is now. But I think it's important to point out to those who are listening on the inside that you know the brethren will tell you that's the devil getting into us, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1668s) we will be, you know us seeing a different point of view now is that we're being possessed by the devil.

Well no it's just called having your eyes open and like we've just said about seeing an alternative view and seeing that actually yes there's two sides to this story there's two sides to this point of view. And I think it's important that we point that out because people in the inside will have that drummed into them [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1699s) those of us who are now speaking, you know speak against brethren or you know speak truth about them that they'll be they'll be thinking that we're possessed by the devil. Well no we're not we're just, we're just at our eyes open and can actually see that there is another point of view.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1719s)

Yeah and they think that we've turned our backs on the light whereas actually we haven't our eyes have just been like you say open to a whole other viewpoint. And I was reading some stuff the other day of what has been said about these so-called opposers and that you know they're having these special prayer meetings that will be removed. And I dug out some old ministry and I found [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1750s) that Bruce Hales said that the brethren should pray that we should be removed. Like that's a pretty harsh, yeah I'm decide it's a big, it's a big thing for to get your flock to pray for like actual removal is actually what, death? 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1775s)

Well, I know somebody inside the brethren that did ask what was meant by the actual words they were praying for. They were exhorted to pray that those against Mr Hales should be removed and that's what they actually prayed for. And somebody inside did ask, what do we mean by removed and they didn't get a reply. But they have to be very very careful with things like that because that in English law could be considered as [hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1805s) speech and hate speech is a criminal, yeah it's a criminal offense.

And it's similar to, you know the, when Salman Rushdie had a fatwa issued against him. I mean, they were a bit more obvious than saying it was a fatwa, which is a death sentence, but it's a similar thing. And they have to be very, very careful of that. But I wonder what that kind of thing does to the minds of the brethren inside. Do any of them, do you think, stop and think, hold on a minute, am I actually sitting here [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1835s) praying that people who I think are opposed to the brethren might die? But I don't know, Lindy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1845s)

I was just going to say well the thing is even if they do think that it's okay in their mindset because I think all of us, you know I'm going to be a bit provocative here but say if we believe that somebody was genuinely a huge threat was really destructive was really wicked that was roaming around the world today, or I'm thinking of you know your Hitler or [whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1875s), some other people might put Trump I don't know whoever in that category, or you know a really terrible child abuser or a murderer, you know we would probably feel happy if we heard that person died right.

**Abi Thompson**

Whereas they protect them the child abusers they will protect…

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1845s)

 But my point that I'm trying to say is that in our worldview if somebody is really wicked and terrible and destructive and evil yeah we do feel happy when they die or we might [wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1905s) for them to die. And so again in the brethren's whole mentality yeah, they have been taught that we are these wicked evil destructive people to be feared. And so because that whole way of thinking has already been been sowed and as you said it's like a rhetoric that's been there you grow up in it you soak in it then it's such an easy thing to do to to think yeah that's great if so and so dies.

There's a really interesting little [short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1936s) film called The Push, I should try and find it to put the link in the notes but it shows it was like a psychological experiment thing where they did a whole lot of things to build unsuspecting people up to shoving someone off a high building. And they did actually have a safety net in place in that but it was really scary how many people actually it was quite easy to get them to that point. And it sort of shows you that again if you build this whole world view and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1966s) constant indoctrination without a certain thing it's very very easy to get people to pray for the death of someone who they believe is an opposer or to do, to pay for surveillance against them or to fork out thousands to try and litigate them to the ground. So I feel like appealing to their sense of humanity or compassion doesn't work because we are not worthy of compassion we are, we're crap beneath your feet you know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=1994s)

Yeah yeah I was gonna say that's interesting you mentioned that Lindy because it's actually that's exactly what I was thinking. And you know going even further it's only got to take one really fanatical person that's totally in awe of Bruce Hales to actually dare I say it kill one of us. Because as you say the rhetoric's there for so long and like you illustrated about that film you know it was built up and up and up until they pushed somebody off a high building. Well who's to say that harm can become one of us, from one of the members obviously from Bruce Hales himself, but it could easily come from one of the members that's been so indoctrinated.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2039s)

Yeah and that there has been death threats there's been absolute obvious death threats. I know people, I have to be careful what I say, but they are living under police protection because the death threats are real and they are traceable back to the hierarchy of the leaders of the brethren. And you just think [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2069s) know I personally don't believe that God would hear those prayers because they are prayers of hate, and I mean murder is completely ungodly.

I remember I was still in the brethren at this time I remember there was someone working alongside a journalist in Sydney that I can't remember the name it's been years since I read the article but I remember one of the people working with the journalist, I think it was a member of the brethren or maybe an ex-member of the brethren, I can't remember, but he was supporting this journalist and he died of a heart attack. And I remember Bruce Hales ministered that this person, God had come down and struck them because of what they were doing. And that you know that puts massive fear in you that God can actually come and strike you down and that's not the God I know now. The God I know now is a loving God, he doesn't do stuff like that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2146s)

I mean I think what the brethren, I'm trying to think when I am it's a long time for me but my brethren mindset I think my brethren mindset would have been very much as Lindy describes that the people I would be praying for to be removed that's what they deserve. I don't think with my brethren mindset you would want them but it would more be there to get an illness that would you know or some terrible accident or something. But I also agree with you Ross, fanaticism knows no bounds [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2177s) you only have to look at what happened in World War 2 where you had whole communities of Jewish people being executed for no reason other than the fact they were Jewish.

But you see how far fanaticism can go. And what I would say to anyone outside who is fearful of that is the police do take this kind of speech quite seriously and I personally have reported it to the police because I was concerned. They took it very seriously and they have given an [incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2207s) number so it is something that you know, for your own personal protection, it's worth lodging I think personally. You like to think nothing will happen but fanaticism you don't know where it can go do you? And the influence such a thing you have on a person's mind.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2228s)

Yeah on the flip side we want to say to our listeners  here that we don't endorse violence or hate speech but and this is where it gets tricky because you know recently there was a legal case here in New Zealand with the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Jehovah's Witnesses were trying to get out of being included in the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care. And and they were claiming oh, religious [persecution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2259s), religious persecution.

And the lawyer acting for the Attorney General said criticism of a religion is allowed that is not a breach of your, that is not persecution of religion. And that's where I think there's such kind of clever mind games being played here because yes we are criticizing the exclusive brethren doctrines and practices that we believe are harmful. And yet you know yeah there's a quote floating somewhere on the internet that says you know;  

“Let me never be so [presumptuous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2289s) as to believe I'm being persecuted when I'm simply being held to account or criticized.”

And that kind of thing is going on because yes we do criticize, yes we do call out things that we believe are harmful but that doesn't mean that we hate the brethren or that we yeah want to see them all dead or any of these awful violent crimes. And I think ex-members have to be careful as well because there are severe injustices and huge amounts of pain. And [recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2320s) I think this year there's been two terrible crimes committed by ex-Jehovah witnesses where they've caused death to current members.

And I don't know all the details of the cases but I understand they were former members who were carrying a lot of pain and a lot of concern and they did commit acts of violence which is awful. And I would say to any ex-brethren that's feeling really really wounded or [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2350s) their life is being destroyed to please reach out and seek help and get support because violence is never ever the answer.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2360s)

No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2360s)

It isn't and actually that sort of you're absolutely right Lindy. There is no harm wished on any member of the brethren and two wrongs don't make a right. But but you do have a certain empathy for the extreme pain as you say those two members, ex-members of the Jehovah's witness community had probably suffered similar pain and trauma that many ex-brethren members had, and you can understand how that can just become [overwhelming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2391s) that you can take to doing something almost not in a sound state of mind. But help is…reach out to the, you know to the Olive Leaf Network or other networks there's some in the UK here, the Family Survival Trust and so on that will put you in touch with people who can help you cope with that. 

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2411s)

That's right yeah and I think this goes back to, it'd be good to have a quick chat about this “bitter” thing. I think it was yes Ross who mentioned it earlier because that is a phrase as we know it's brethren-speak. And I was quite amused recently to learn that Jehovah's Witnesses also use the exact phrase and “poison” these are two phrases that are used by the brethren to describe opposers right? They call them “bitter” and they call them “poison” [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2441s) I was so fascinated to learn that the Jehovah's Witnesses use those phrases well.

And I think there was another group it was the Two by Twos or something like that that use the same expression. So it's always kind of slightly amusing when you find that there's another group that also believes they have the light and you know the Man God and but yeah, I mean I think it'd be helpful to talk about those two phrases. Like let's go with” bitter” right like what's one of your understanding ?  [Hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2472s) me with what's your understanding of what the brethren mean when they use that term.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2477s)

That's interesting. I mean bitter, bitter, bitter implies somebody that's full of hate and hate that perhaps isn't necessarily justified, they can't get past that hate and that anger. That's certainly not what I feel towards the brethren. I don't know what others opinions are on that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2504s)

When I hear the word bitter I think of like a sour lemon and like that there in your mouth and actually maybe I am a bit bitter. I'm all right with that because what I've been through no one should ever have to go through so maybe I am a bit bitter because there's been so much injustice. Okay I'm talking about myself in my life and a lot of other people's [lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2534s). I haven't got to that stage of healing where I'm not no longer bitter, right now I probably am bitter. I'll absolutely hold my hands up and say I'm probably one of the bitter people that that and that I'd be labeled as bitter. Yeah I am I'm okay with that right now because I think if it happened to them what happened to me at the hands of the brethren [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2565s) don't think that they could sit on their high horse and say that they'd feel any different.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2568s)

You know my understanding of bitter is really the same as yours Jackie. You know you can't get past the anger and hate that's what it implies but the converse is totally true because you know I miss my mum more and more every single day that goes by it gets hard it doesn't get easier it gets harder. So how do you equate that with being bitter?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2597s)

Yeah. I mean there's two ways of looking at it because bitter I think as a word is a very negative sounding word isn't it it, implies hate, it's a negative word. Now I don't know if they still do, I'm sure they do but when I was in the brethren one of the phrases they used to use which I prefer was “righteous anger” and I thought they still used that phrase but I do remember they used to talk about righteous anger. And they said it was an anger, if you like, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2627s) was fair because something was unjust \- but that also could be used to describe somebody that's bitter. 

You know you could argue people have been through so much that the anger they feel is righteous but it's what they do with that anger and bitterness, or you know anger isn't it that is the more difficult thing, how they channel that anger.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2649s)

Well I'd say I'm fueling it for change yeah so and trying to protect the children in there yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2660s)

I totally agree with and appreciate all those things you've shared. And I agree, I think that bitterness, I haven't looked up a dictionary definition of it, but it does sort of refer to that holding on to something and it's viewed as like, an unjustified holding on to resentment, and that sort of thing. Whereas I know for myself and I think for many, many ex-brethren, yes we have an ongoing sense of pain and a sense of injustice and a sense of hurt we have ongoing grief that we carry.

Like Ross saying that he still desperately misses his mum I think all of us have this ongoing grief and pain particularly because of the doctrine of separation and what it's done to us as well as as well as other things. And what I want to say so clearly to people in the brethren and to ex-brethren is that feeling pain in an ongoing way [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2720s) feeling that righteous anger as Jackie said, that is not the same as being bitter. 

The brethren look at those expressions of pain and they say there's a bitter person it does not necessarily mean it's the same thing.

We're allowed to carry pain and and to talk about it. It's our reality and to talk about it does not mean that we're bitter. I think it's a, I think sometimes in culty terminology it's called a [thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2750s)\-stopping cliche or like a phrase that the brethren use, you know they and it's a phrase brethren use to shut stuff down. And I think that's true of when when we express our pain in our hurt and say “this is what's happened to me” their response instead of being able to acknowledge it and say” that's really hard yes it's been a very destructive road” instead their response is to shut it down by saying don't listen to that person they're just bitter. 

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2780s)

It is really interesting. I think they make it a negative word because they want the control and people to stay in there. But I was just looking up the definition of bitter and apparently it's a feeling or showing anger, hurt or resentment because of bad experiences or a sense of unjust treatment.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2805s)

Not a bad thing. Yeah sort of sums it up really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2810s)

And I think it's exactly what we say is that the feelings that any of us have as a result of what our experiences have been in the brethren are something we should own, there's something we should not deny. 

It's where you take them to the next step, and as you say I think you're right Lindy I think they use the word bitter to shut down analyzing exactly what it is we're trying to do. And I wanted to pick up another word that you use there Lindy when you first [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2840s) about bitterness and that was the word poison because that's another word that's been bandied around in the brethren a little bit about the things we say and the influence we can have.

So I want to sort of delve into that a little bit more. I mean I know we all know the infamous “rat poison ministry” where your brother, wasn't he Lindy, was referred to and at the time he was going through a certain amount of mental torment, and the [inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2871s) of the wording was that rather than having the occasional correspondence with you his sister who wasn't in the brethren at the time, he would be better off taking rat poison. That was the inference of what he said wasn't it. 

Now the brethren say, because this was the national press and it's readily there in the public domain what Bruce Hales said, and the brethren's defense to that was what Bruce Hales said was taken out of context by the [press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2901s). I mean is that something that we, you're laughing Lindy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2905s)

Like just to quickly set the scene if anybody isn't aware of it because it was a few years ago now already but yeah, so I left in 2008 and my brother Braden along with the rest of my family completely cut me off. And several years went by I think probably four or so or five years and and then I got one or two tiny little emails from him and it was like it was literally like “hey how are you doing.”

And then I was like so excited to hear from him that I sent all these questions and was really wanting [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2943s) connect and he wouldn't reply much because you know how some people are, they still think you're a bit wicked. And it was like next to no contact at all, it was literally I think two or three emails.

Just to even paint some of the background context. But yeah and then my brother was living in England and he was struggling and he was staying with an Englishman. And like I think yeah why I feel like this kind of matters just for setting the scene, maybe for those who aren't brethren, but when people are struggling in the brethren you believe that hearing from Bruce Hales about your situation [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=2989s) a situation you care about is equivalent to kind of touching Jesus’ robe as he walks past.

And because lots of brethren can't get time with Bruce Hales, what this weird habit they have, this practice they have is to pick up the mic in a fellowship meeting or a brethren conference and just barge in there, and you know you've got to be really desperate to do this. You really want to hear from the Man of God and hear from you know the Holy Spirit to give divine insight into this [burden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3019s) that you're carrying. 

And so this Englishman had been having my brother live with him and and I think he's you know he's a good guy and he was caring for my brother and he was desperately reaching out to Bruce Hales asking and hoping for, you know, a word of encouragement some advice to help him and to take back to help this young man who was struggling.

And yeah I just feel like that context matters because it was a struggling young guy, and a kind man [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3049s) was doing his best to help him, reaching out to Bruce Hales in a public setting. And as we know all of the ministry is printed verbatim into little paperback white books and distributed around the globe within a couple of weeks of the meeting before it is then later printed into the more, the colored bound versions. And so this wasn't just a private conversation in a, you know in a meeting room in a [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3079s) or anything, this was said publicly and then it was printed verbatim and it was published to every single brethren household in the white books.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3089s)

Yeah can I also add on that it was said publicly it was also said in a place of public religious worship wasn't it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3096s)

Yeah and I think the interesting thing about that wording was that opposers and opponents to the truth were mentioned. And obviously even then because at the time I had no idea like when I heard about it, I had no idea really at first that Bruce Hales was talking possibly about me because like I said I wasn't doing anything to be an opposer at that time. I was studying at Bible college, for goodness sake, literally. And yeah, so then this stuff came out that Bruce Hales responded to him, somehow Bruce Hales must have heard.

I can't remember the exact exchange there in the meeting, but must have heard or had some idea that Braden was talking to me or talking to some other opponents of the truth. And because he specifically said if he's doing that, then you might as well finish yourself off, I think was the wording that was used. Is that right, Jackie?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3158s)

I mean, the question asked, and I'll paraphrase it, but you spoke about somebody raising the question in the meeting, which is a public church meeting. And the question asked they said they were concerned about his, his presumably being your brother, contact with someone who's under discipline and opposed. So that was obviously their view of you at the time.

 I don't know quite how they got that view [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3189s) the response was more or less to say,  you know, if he's having links with persons under discipline or opposed, that's the poison, that's the rotten poison. 

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3209s)

Oh so he sort of did a play on words that he was saying that, talking with the opposers is poison and so then he's saying you're better to go and take some actual poison like rat poison or arsenic was suggested.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3224s)

Yeah he then went on to say the trouble with your fellow is he's got poisoned and he might as well get a shot of, and that's when he went on to talk about poison and arsenic.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3239s)

So that's a really powerful illustration of what we've been trying to say that absolutely yeah Bruce Hales actively teaches, yeah actively teaches that to have to do with opposers is the same thing as drinking poison or taking poison into your system. Which again it's very dehumanizing and very like very strong language right? And [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3269s) when you start to get concerned is when one group, like when people look at hate speech and look at groups that are getting extreme, one of the things they do is to employ really extreme language especially to dehumanize those who they're set against. And that does really concern me here is that for Bruce Hales to use language like poison to describe ex-members is is really hateful.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3296s)

Yeah and to set the scene this would have been, I mean this was some eight years ago, eight nine years ago but it would have been what the brethren call a fellowship meeting here in the UK. And there would have been several thousand people there I would imagine because these meetings normally do have.

 But what concerned me most about that kind of rhetoric … to explain to anybody who's non-brethren “under discipline” means anybody who has been withdrawn from the [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3326s), that's how they refer sometimes to us who aren't among them, we're “under discipline.” 

That would have been heard by children, teenagers, in other words, people with very impressionable minds growing up with that kind of rhetoric. And you can understand how then they have the fear of anybody who is under discipline, let alone opposed and speaking out, can't you?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3355s)

And also another really weird thing that I just find inexplicable is that current members have informed me that the, is it brown book for Hales, the bound volume of his ministry, those meetings the whole poison stuff has been edited out. We know it was printed in the white books and distributed around the world so you know it leads the question why would they then edit that out of the brown booksI

It reminds me, I don't know [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3385s) you guys have read 1984, but there's constant revisioning of history and yeah before, and of the newspapers, and what happened, and it's like for me it feels like a similar thing is happening here. It's like why would you send out something one week and then a few months later just completely remove all the trace of it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3403s)

So again to explain ,and a bit more recently, just correct me if I've got this understanding wrong, but the white books come out every week and they're Bruce Hales's ministry and meetings and then they condense it down to one big book that comes out once a month or something like that. And what you're saying is Lindy in the big book they condensed it they'd actually taken this out, but the words that he actually quoted have been quoted in the national press. So we know it's there because we know the white [book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3433s) is out there somewhere, and has been leaked to the national press because it was quoted there.

But again I think the brethren are taught very much to have a big fear of the media as well. I remember a story of one ex-member who asked their parents if they'd read an article that had come out again some years back, it came out in The Times here in the UK which is quite a well-thought-of newspaper, and the response they got was “I don't need to read that because I know it's all [lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3463s).“

So it's that absolute blind belief that stems from the fear. It's not even I've read it and discounted it,  it was that I don't need to read it because I know it's lies. So maybe they believe the white book was the original white book that came out was lies? I don't know. Lindy, or anyone else, how do they explain that away?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3485s)

I think in their view, because at some stage I had communication from my mum about it or mum talked to Braden or something. And again, in their view, it wasn't a bad thing for Bruce Hales to say because they do believe that having to do with outsiders is poison. And so, yeah, for them it was, you know, accurate. But, you know, there are a couple of other things he said at that same point that I found really weird. I think he made some reference about him drinking that people might think he's drinking which again it's like why is a Man of God [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3515s) this in a religious context.

I think he said it a similar, you know a few minutes later or something, and he also made a joke about my brother's name because my brother's initials are BS and he made a joke and said oh that's just BS isn't it, which everyone knows that's a joke about the acronym for bullshit. 

And so I'm like well even if the poison stuff you've got a reason for that, can you tell me why your Man of God is [making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3545s) a slur on a young man in trouble's name and and and making a slur about it being like a swear word? Like where's the love and compassion and the Holy Spirit kind of wisdom and grace in that you know? So just pure christianity yeah, just what a lovely example of christianity he is. 

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3569s)

But it's bringing up some really raw stuff for me. So I was in the brethren at the point of this ministry and I was at the very impressionable stage and I was really suffering with my mental health. I was going through court cases about the sexual abuse that I suffered as a child and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3599s) had basically no support and I was suicidal no doubt about it and I'm quite happy to admit it. And I remember brothers coming home from the Sutton meeting and quoting what Bruce Hales had said about rat poison and arsenic etc.

And they kind of put it into a kind of, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3629s) sounded like scriptural language and they said that “ It's better to die than to sin. “

And at the end of my suicide I wrote a suicide letter and at the end of my suicide letter I wrote those words that “It's better to die than than to sin” and that that was the impression that it had on me [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3660s) a young person.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3662s)

When all of this was leaked out,the bit that concerned me is that this is the rhetoric that's coming from the person you believe is the Man of God, because they do believe that in the brethren and you are feeling at a very low ebb yourself. You know it it comes down to the the suggestiveness of it you know, on impressionable people.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3687s)

Yeah and the and the people that were at that fellowship meeting, it was a special meeting, it was one of the last meetings of his England tour and the people that went were the special last like the people that go to the last meeting.

I suppose it's like the end of a sort of Elton John concert I suppose where he's never going to be seen again, because that's what everyone thinks about Bruce Hales every [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3718s) he bloody comes over that we might not see him again. That'll be the day. That's not a death threat.

And they came back what they'd call “fired up” and so to hear those things from people that are so-called fired up and that they've got the gift of the gab and that's how they brought the ministry back.

You know it really leaves a, well for me it's a scar, for other people it really leaves an impression. It's really really bloody dangerous. It's terrifyingly dangerous, it is. And I think it's something that for [Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3759s) Hales won't go away. No, one of those mosquitoes in your bedroom that keeps buzzing, Bruce, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3772s)

And I wanted to ,sorry could I just jump into, so another thing that helps you to understand the mentality is that Bruce Hales and I think John and a couple of the other great men they've sort of for a while in in the brethren theology, they've slowly been from Darby onwards it's built and built and built. And if anyone's interested I can send you some information around showing this, but Bruce Hales has [categorically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3802s) stated that you can't leave the brethren and and retain your salvation.

And yeah like I said this is something he's built on previous leaders they've been slowly over the decades increasingly bringing in this teaching that “salvation is in the assembly, blessed sphere” as the hymn says. 

Yeah oh no it's quite tricky because they do on the one hand have lip service to salvation being in Jesus Christ but they have actually added on “salvation in the assembly” that that is you know where that is where you can only experience and enjoy salvation and so by default then if you leave you lose your salvation.

And Bruce Hales, he's categorically taught that, that you cannot leave and retain your salvation, which I challenge you, [find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3855s) me that in scripture. You know, it's not in scripture. It's particular brethren theology that they've overlaid onto their interpretation of Christianity. And so I think it kind of relates because it plays into this whole thing where they then paint us opposers as not just, we're not even just bitter people, but they teach that we are people who threaten their very salvation and who threaten to take away the salvation of individuals [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3886s) well as who threaten this very special thing, the assembly.

And so yeah they lay all these religious layers of spiritual meaning and theological meaning over it that mean that we're so much worse than just a bunch of bitter people, we're a spiritual threat to them as well yeah. So to any listener I encourage you like if you're worried about this stuff, if you're worried that  Bruce really is the only Man of God and that [salvation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3917s) can only be experienced in the assembly, like go to your bible, read your bible, look it up for yourself. Look up for scriptures that might challenge or question this stuff.

Because I think you'll find that a lot of the scriptures they use to describe us opposers are actually just talking about general salvation, they're not to do with whether or not you belong to the brethren. Like for example there's one verse they use I think from Matthew and it says [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3947s) about

 “If the light in you turns to darkness oh how great the darkness will be.”

And they use that sort of thing to say; 

“Oh when you leave you become fully darkness.”

 You know that's what an opposer is, whereas scripture's got nothing to do with membership in the PBCC or not, it's to do with your own individual walk with God. And you can leave the brethren and have a walk with God. Your salvation does not need the [PBCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3978s) to be a mediator between you and God.

So I think that any brethren who like that verse, go and read the one straight after it because it's the one about;

“You cannot serve two masters you cannot love God and money.”

 Which is quite a relevant one for brethren to reflect on. 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=3996s)

I think that's a really important point Lindy because as you say again it's the rhetoric they're fed in there isn't it, and the rhetoric is not just that we're speaking out against the brethren, it's built up into to we're speaking out against christianity and it's totally not the case. And I think that probably leads into perhaps now discussing a little bit about why do we do what we [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4027s), because we've kind of told anybody listening, we've tried to understand their mindset because we all had that mindset. Being ex-members we were all there. And we've also sort of spoke about our own experiences of how when we come out and we suddenly realize that, hey, this world is full of human beings just like me. which is a bit of a… Bbut then why are we speaking out, why are we trying to effect change or to help [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4057s) what are our motives for doing it? Because I think maybe people inside understand that, go on Lindy yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4064s)

I'd love to hear from Gilli about that because yeah in many ways for you to speak up, you know you spoke up quite a number of years after leaving which is unusual, because a lot of people just yeah choose to never ever speak up and there are costs to speaking up like we know. And you spoke about also you didn't just speak up but you shared about something that's very taboo and possibly quite shameful, especially as a man, so yeah what what led you to speak up?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4094s)

No I think for me personally obviously that you know there's the element that I'd obviously been through therapy and you know reached a point of being at peace with what I'd been through. And acknowledging that actually you know, not to go too much into my personal situation, but acknowledging that actually I wasn't at fault which is what I believed for years. But also I think the other element [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4124s) me is that I know full well that I would probably never realistically, I'll probably never get legal justice because it's my word against my abuser’s.

There's, you know, there's no evidence other than our word. The brethren have a track record of throwing, you know, endless amounts of money at court cases like that. So the chances are from a legal point of view, I will probably never get justice. So from my own personal point of view, this is my justice. I can expose something for what it is. I can encourage people to talk, to speak out. I can encourage people to, to realize that something actually isn't right, it isn't normal, because you know, that was, that was my personal situation. That's what I was told that it was normal, it was okay. It was, you know, all these things.

 If someone can recognize parts of my story and apply it to their own story and go [actually,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4190s) yeah, that rings bells. Yes that you know, that resonates with me then if I can help one person to put a stop to something they're going through, regardless of what it is, whether it's abuse or you know, anything. If I can help someone put a stop to what they're suffering and to what they're being put through then that from my point of view is more justice than someone being you know, what would the punishment be, the couple years in jail at most.

### 

Yeah I mean we don't know what the justice system would ever do. And the likelihood is they'd still be protected in the peebs and they still have all the protection they wanted.

 So for me, this, this is a way of saying, look, I come through the other side, I managed to expose something. I can hopefully someone else can see it can can bring a parallel to their experience and can recognize their own experiences and hopefully have the courage to talk to someone, whether you know, it doesn't necessarily mean speaking out publicly but enough to bring a stop to what they've been through.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4300s)

Yeah it's the accountability thing isn't it.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4303s)

Yeah yeah it is holding people to account, it's the old thing isn't it you can try and silence people. But I've said it before, I know I said it in my personal podcast you're not going to silence me.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4324s)

Yeah, no, really proud of you Gilli.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4332s)

No I think that's really interesting Gilli because you're right about the legal justice, and in a sense sometimes if you go down the route with what you suffered, what does it achieve?

What will affect the change is the exposing of the system that allows these abuses, whatever they are, whether they're abuses towards children or whether they're abuses within a marriage or whether they're alcoholic abuses, whatever the abuses are it's [exposing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4363s) those abuses that will put pressure on them slowly slowly slowly to change or stop or give people the courage to realize that they are victims of whatever abuse they are victims of.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4378s)

Yeah and I think it's that it's also coming to that point of realization because for me personally I never wanted to acknowledge what that was, because it was too like Lindy says it was too shameful, because it … and especially in the brethren, if that had come out in the brethren I would have had a label as a weirdo.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4404s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4405s)

Do you know what I mean? And it's that kind of, if I can just help one person realise, actually, look, you had no part in this. You had no, you know, the fault wasn't at your door.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4421s)

Yeah, that's so important.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4426s)

And yeah, Bruce Hales labels us as dopes, as mindless, filled by Satan. I've written out a list; that God's finished with them, that we're full of the spirit of antichrist and that will be left out in the cold maybe eternally, that we're grievous wolves, we've given up the person of the Christ. We might be speaking about [sacred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4456s) things that they have no right to let those words leave their mouth, every word they utter is blasphemy, every breath is blasphemy. 

After you've just heard what Gilli said do you really think that he's any of those things? That we're any of those things? Because we're all standing for the same thing as Gilli, let's be honest, does it sound like Gilli is filled with Satan and against what's true? I don't think so.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4484s)

That's really interesting Abi because yeah I've been having a bit more to do with some ex-JWs because they’ve been contacting Olive Leaf Network and that's interesting you said that stuff about them being part of the antichrist that Bruce Hales has taught that, because the JWs don't call it opposers they call them apostates, but it's the same term, it's the same thing yeah yeah people have left the faith and they believe that they're part of the antichrist and and they're doomed for [destruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4515s) and all that sort of thing.

And I did some religious studies at some point, not very much but I came across briefly that there are other terms that other groups use as well, like I think for jews it's “kofer” or something which is similar to the the arabic term “Kāfir” but it's like yeah every group it seems has got a label, not just for outsiders, but those who have left the faith and then in particular those who speak up. 

So I haven't left the faith, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4545s) you've left their doctrine, left their version of faith and I find that helpful to be reminded that these are really common social practices that a lot of a lot of religious groups or high control groups practice is choosing particular designations for those who they view are really reprehensible. It just helps me to realize that the brethren are not alone in doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4576s) they're not unique yeah not at all 

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4579s)

ButtThen from a religious point of view, from a christian point of view to be accused that you're going on within the spirit of the antichrist, and an antichrist is anyone who is against Jesus Christ and teaches that Jesus is not from God or not the Son of God to say that opposers or apostates are that and we're those people, no it's [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4609s) completely ludicrous. And then I was messaging someone that left a very very long time ago and they said to me the irony is is that they could possibly becoming themselves dangerously close to that because they are preaching the only way to be saved is through them, and the only way you're going to be [saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4639s) is to be found among the brethren when he returns which actually…

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4644s)

…is adding to the gospel which scripture tells us explicitly not to do.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4649s)

Yeah and that's over against the the idea that christ is the only person that can save us from this world. I don't know you're way more, I don't know what's the word, spiritual than me so you'll be able to put like some scripture to it or something but.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4674s)

Yeah you're completely right. I guess you know in summary we could say look if you don't believe in God then you don't have to be afraid of the brethren and their doctrines and and we're also trying to say if you do believe in God you don't have to be afraid of the brethren and their doctrines. And whether you do or don't believe in God, opposers are not the antichrist. And as Gilli said, I think if we went through each of us, our motivations are not sourced in hatred.

Our motivations are sourced in love, care and compassion for people [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4705s) are still in there. And if you want to stay in there and keep living that life, that's your choice. But our particular concern is for those who want to leave or those who are born and raised in there and haven't had a choice or those who are particularly vulnerable. Like for me I had gone on and built a new life, I love my life I've got great support and friends and family but it was ”hate your life.”

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4730s)

In this world, Lindy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4731s)

Oh yes yeah I've had that one thrown at me. Because for me it wasn't until my brother got booted out, and even hearing this whole poison thing and then seeing my brother get booted out and immense pressure and strain my family went under. And then to have my father excommunicated only for challenging the leaders, not even for immorality or anything but challenging the leaders about some of the things they'd been doing, especially around funds. That's why [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4761s) dad was kicked out.

And to see then his marriage shattered and just to hear that he's had grandchildren born and he's never been sent a photo of them, and to see the family business threatened and all that stuff that is what made me step towards founding Olive Leaf Network. It was like you know what, I might be all right, but the brethren are still arguably the cause of the destruction of many families and many lives [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4792s) someone has to do something. We have to step up.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4799s)

And I want to say it's not easy to step up. It's not easy to step up it's no it's in your story and speaking out about stuff that you believe deeply that is completely wrong and completely un-christian it's really difficult doing it it's not like we sit here and like have a jolly it's it's it's really difficult to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4820s)

I mean I agree in that it's quite interesting, because I would say I was very fortunate in the way I left the Brethren and I had my parents and one of my two brothers, so unlike a lot of people I had the majority of my immediate family. And your priority when you leave is building your life which is exactly what I did, and I married and I had two children and the Brethren was somewhere in the dim distant past to be forgotten about. And the trigger I think I've [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4851s) this before on podcasts but the trigger for me was a phone call for my brother in the brethren who never ever had phoned me in 27 years, asking for help to write to the charity commission to support the brethren in their bid to retain their status. Because firstly why is this so important, why would my brother actually pick up the phone and phone me, which he never has done in 27 years to ask this [question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4881s)? And then like you Lindy, you realize I'm okay, I'm actually extremely fortunate, I've you know had employment I've had children I've got my children with me I'm fortunate enough to have a grandchild which you know people like your father Lindy he's grandchildren he hasn't seen as have many many others.

But the motivation for doing it is exactly that. If somebody is doing something that's wrong, if it isn't exposed it will continue, and it's also [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4911s) help those who are struggling with it as well. Yeah so I totally agree Lindy it's certainly not done for money, it's certainly not done for anything like that, it's done purely with the desire to try and help. And I think as you say Lindy if people want to reach out I hope that what we've managed to do tonight is dispel in our own unstructured way some of the myths around [opposers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4942s), and hopefully been able to come across that we are opposed to what we believe is fundamentally wrong and harming people but we're not opposed to faith and Christianity, and your freedom to choose the faith you want to choose. I don't know if anyone wants to add anything to that or whether we've done enough to dispel the myths surrounding us, I suppose.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=4967s)

Yeah, one thing I'd like to add, it's a bit off-piste, but I've just noted something down that basically, unlike, I think it's fair to say, unlike the Brethren, we are out here and we help anybody regardless of their religion, their colour, their race, their sexual orientational preference, or their beliefs whereas you know, and and yet we're classed as opposers, but we we help anybody we don't help just a certain few.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5003s)

Yeah I agree Ross and I think the thing to remember to people inside, all of us and I'll put it in inverted commas opposers, have been there, we have all left the brethren and all had to face that huge jump off the precipice. And we're just there to help really and that's why we'll keep speaking out. Yeah Lindy I understand you were telling me you'd written a poem about how it felt being viewed as this opposer, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5033s) sort of wicked person is that something you want to share with the listeners?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5037s)

Yeah I'll be happy to. I think I wrote it in about 2016 after a very painful encounter trying to visit a much loved family member and their family and, you know, them just refusing to and saying things like that I'm an opposer. And so yeah I wrote this poem and sort of you know some emotional and mental turmoil because I was just realizing that you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5067s) even though my heart is just to love and connect with you and I still just love and care for you this realization that I'm no longer Lindy to you.

Instead I am something to be despised, I'm something reprehensible, you know, I'm this evil scary threatening person and it was just so shocking to me and it still is ,because I'm like I'm just me, I just love you, I'm not out to destroy you but yeah so that's where this poem [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5097s) from.Sso it's called;

A dragon fully alive.

I am a young dragon born into a world where dragons are hated and feared.

 I look at you and I love you. I reach out and smile, hoping for you to smile back and love me in turn. 

But all you see are teeth and fangs. Instead you shriek and shrink back. 

You gather your children and run from me, hissing and spitting, your tongue flicking in hate. 

And I, I am wounded by you. I am burned and scarred. I turn and look down at myself. Am I so ugly, so to be feared? Am I covered in dragon scales? I am confused and bewildered. 

The only smoke I see is [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5156s) mirrors that are yours. The only scales that I can see are the ones covering your eyes.

You hate who I have grown up to be, you fear what I represent but I cannot unsee what I have seen, I cannot unlearn the truth that I know.

 You tell me to change, to return, to deny, to hide, to stop speaking up but to do so would be dying and yet never dead. 

To do this would turn me into a monster far more hideous than anything that you think you see now. And I toy with the idea of this just for the prize of gaining your love, of gaining your smiles, your welcome, your home.

 But I cannot. You don't understand.

Me being a dragon to you is not something I wanted. It's not something I can choose or unchoose. It's not a flighty fancy. It's not something I can disrobe from like the day's clothes. 

No, being a dragon to you happened simply because I was true to myself and true to who I believe God to be. Being a dragon to you was born out of my own coming alive, not being a harbinger of death.

 It has come from my own integrity to living life to the fullest, even when this means being a dragon to you. At least I am a dragon fully alive.

And so I'll raise my head. I'm weakened from your beating but I'm strong with the desire to live. My nostrils will flare, not with hostility but with the breath of life, because it is not what you call me, but it is my will to live with integrity that counts. 

And so I dream of the day that you might see through your scales and your smoke, through your scales and your smoke.

 I dream of the day that you might see clear and true that me being a dragon to you has everything to do with how you see me, and it has nothing to do with who I am.

Oh, wow, Lindy. I think that's an excellent point to stop because that just totally summarises how I feel as a so-called, labelled an opposer. I don't know how the others feel about that. That was very moving, Lindy. Thank you.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5323s)

Incredible.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5324s)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We can't really add to that, can we? Thank you, Lindy. Thank you to all of you for your time this evening. I hope what we've discussed has just opened the eyes a little bit around this word, bitter and opposed, that the brethren hear so often about us. And just to reiterate everything that's said in your poem, Lindy, we're not dragons, we're not bitter, we're not opposed. We will speak out to what's wrong and we will help anybody that reaches out. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5355s) reach out to the Olive Leak Network, any of us, info at getalife.me, I think the email is. And thank you all and see you all next time.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSaUKm4ic-k&t=5364s)

Yeah. See you later, dragons. Take care. Bye. Thank you. See you later.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
