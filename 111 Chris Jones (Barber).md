## Summary

Chris Jones’ last view of God’s Chosen People was from the balcony of the London meeting hall in Park Street, as the Aberdeen crisis split JND’s famous “Metropolitan” congregation in two, and half the “saints” stormed out of the hall amid angry recriminations.
Born into the well-known Barber brethren family, Chris changed his surname to Jones when he left, in defiance of his parent’s appalling mistreatment of him. Intelligent and curious, and with a passion for geology and fossils, Chris found the narrow-minded and coercive Brethren regime unbearable, and his many acts of rebellion as a child resulted in harsh corporeal punishment.
Leaving as soon as he legally could, Chris worked to pay his way through university, getting a B.Sc. with honors in Geology, and moved to Africa, where he became a  exploration geologist and consultant for gold and platinum mining operations, then took up a teaching career as a lecturer in the University of Limpopo, South Africa.
Chris had resolutely put his dark formative years in the PBCC behind him, and forged ahead with his exciting and successful life – but on his recent retirement, he came across the Get-A-Life podcasts, and felt a desire to tell his story, and to offer hope, encouragement and help to the current generation of young people trapped inside the narrow walls of the cult.
Above all, Chris’ sparkling and warm personality shines out in this podcast as a testimony to an exciting, happy, and successful life that had such a dark and unpromising beginning.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=53s)

Hi everyone. Welcome back to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl. I am an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church from Maple Creek, Saskatchewan in Canada, and I left in 1992\. And today I have with me Richard on the panel today. He is an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren and the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church as well. And he is from Cambridge in the UK. And our very special guest today is Chris Jones, [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=83s) from Forest Hill in London, UK, who now resides in South Africa. So welcome, Chris, and welcome, Richard.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=91s)

Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=92s)

I am super excited, Chris, to have you on here. You have quite the colorful story that we are all looking forward to hear. Many people will recognize your name on social media, underneath comments on the Ex-Exclusive Brethren pages. So we are excited to be able to attach a story to your face. And so I'm going to just hand the mic right over to you if you want to introduce yourself and let us know how you became outside of the Exclusive Brethren [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=122s) you left way back when and it was known as Exclusive Brethren then so take it away.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=127s)

Well thank you Cheryl. Um yes I, I'm very happy to to be on this podcast. It's, I'm having to think back several decades to try and remember all the ins and outs and why I left the Brethren and how I left and all this. And actually, when I look at the really sad stories about how people have left and they've lost [everything,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=157s) I was totally unscathed, really. I'm so happy for that. I think I left when I was 16, back in 1970\. And in a rather bizarre way, I actually profoundly thanked my parents for teaching me what an awful religion they followed.

My father came home from work on the train, gulped down a meal and then rushed off to the meetings and there was absolutely no family life whatsoever. Ever. Um my, my father was Charles Barber from London. I actually assumed the name Jones after leaving the Exclusive Brethren. I feel certainly no bitterness. I just feel very sad for people trapped inside. Well how did all this happen? Wel [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=216s) was born in London, UK to an Exclusive Brethren family in 1953\.

I grew up in Forest Hill in southeast London and attended the City Hall in Park Street, London. I've got three siblings, two older sisters and a younger brother. I haven't seen them since 1970, although I have actually spoken to them since that time.

Well I, I followed my my two older sisters into uh funnily enough a Church of England primary school in London. Um by the time I was seven which would have been in 1960, I began to realize I was different from the other kids at school.

I've been selected to to play one of the kings in the school nativity play, and my father wrote a letter to my teacher telling her that I was not allowed to act in this role and I was so sad because I'm actually a sort of, I like to be the center of attention and I, I loved acting even at seven.

I also had an invitation to a school friend's birthday party, but again, my father wrote a letter for me to give to the boy, declining, and I was a seven-year-old. I often wonder what the letter said.

Well, it was during all the upheavals in the early 1960s, 1960, actually, the year would have been 1960, and I was excused from religious instruction and from school assembly and I wasn't allowed at the end of the year, I wasn't allowed to participate in the school party and all that. And then, well, unsurprisingly I was then withdrawn from the school and transferred to a non-secular school and that would have been about 1961\. I would have been about eight. As for the meetings in those days, I remember having to sit through Sunday meetings and occasionally on Saturday when I was a little bit older. I can remember attending the three-day meetings at Alexandra Palace in London with Big Jim Taylor, Central Hall Westminster. In the famous 1959 meetings, I was probably there but I was too young to to remember anything. And I remember the, the, the three-day meetings in Dorking in 1964 when Big Jim went missing for a day. Um I heard a lot of excited talk about them but I was really too young to know what it was all about.

Well, on a personal note, life was very boring. I had no friends I could play with.

But I did look forward to family holidays. In those days we were allowed to have them. We lived, of course, in London, in the south of England. We used to go to Margate in the south of England, where I used to chisel fossils out of the chalk cliffs and this actually started some sort of obsession from rocks and fossils which I, it's still with me today. I've just retired as a lecturer in geology [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=445s) a local university. Wow. I, at that time I would have been about nine. I borrowed a book from the school library and it was called The World We Live In.

It is a Time Life book. It influenced me greatly. I used to go to the local museum to attend lectures on fossils and evolution and and at this point I just made up my mind to be a geologist.

Uh I know that this didn't go down with the Brethren. I just kept quiet about it. Um I was now 12 and under immense pressure to ask to, to what do they call it, to break bread. I had to ask to break bread. Um there was just one problem about it. I'd never developed an interest or a belief in religion, especially my parents' one. I was told very strongly that my family would separate from me if I didn't ask for fellowship. Uh I knew this only too well.

Uh there's a, there's a boy a little bit older than me in Bromley just south of London who ate all his meals in the kitchen and I, I remember that strongly. And likewise, I actually had a cousin in St Albans, the, Eversheds are all cousins of mine and this is one of my Evershed cousins, yeah. And my mother is an Evershed. Um and he lived in St Albans. He never asked to to break bread. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=550s) never asked for fellowship I think was the phrase they use. And and and you know like he was considerably older than me but he had all his meals in the kitchen.

Um well I was under all this pressure. I didn't know what to do. I asked my next door neighbor, who seemed to be quite a person I could talk to, and one of my school teachers for advice and they both had the same thing to say. Um you know, basically if taking a pinch of a pinch of bread and drinking a sip of wine every Sunday morning keeps everybody happy, then go and do it.

So, I asked to break bread.

I was 12\. I think I cut it very short, a matter of days before I would have had separate tables, as they said. Now, I'd always been a very naughty boy, even now. Not exactly a good person. I'm still rather naughty at times. But so apparently, I didn't know this, but apparently I've been less naughty over the last few weeks and my [father](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=626s) saw that as the Lord was working with me.

And he proposed me for fellowship. I just wonder what they said at the meeting when my name came up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=639s)

It's kind of a low standard isn't it uh.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=642s)

At the time, in my naivety, I vowed, now I was 12, so as I say, in my naivety as a 12-year-old, I vowed that when I leave school, I'm also going to get a job, move into a flat with a worldly friend and leave the Brethren behind me and live happily ever after. Oh well, little did I know what prescience I had at the time. Um I would do just that. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=672s) not sure about the happy ever after bit though, but I did do exactly that. But events overtook me as I would explain. Well now I was breaking bread. I was a fully fledged saint and, and you have to excuse me if I'm using expressions that were sort of in vogue in the 1960s because I've really been out of touch since 1970 so if they're no longer used. 

Um but I learned [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=703s) to chant the correct prayers at the correct time, give out the right hymn. I never took part in readings, I don't think I was really expected to. Um I was a teenager. Um in 1965 I was 12 going on for 13\. And I remember Bruce Hales senior. It's the only brush I've ever had with the Hales dynasty. This is Bruce Hales senior, yeah. We went to see him at a brother's house in North London. I think it was Max Woodcock, the the brother, yes. Um he, uh, Bruce Hales is apparently giving financial advice to some brothers and he used to disappear into a room and and then he would go out and [drinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=760s) the whiskey of course. I remember that. We all had at that time, we all had to make money and put it in the collection, apparently for a new city room. Uh well I, I actually made some money. I'm not really very business orientated but I used to get these, we called them liver tins from the local butchery and I used to paint them and sell them as waste paper baskets.

And I did make some money, but I never put it in the collection.

So.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=800s)

You sold these, where are you selling these, to the Brethren?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=805s)

That was handy for the ministry wasn't it.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=808s)

Oh, I, I think honestly I would cringe if I could see my handiwork today. But so, and I think the Brethren were just, you know, doing the thing and buying it from a committed young brother.

Little did they know. Now the next thing I knew was that the Hales’s were apparently wrong. You know, there was a spate of confessions and some really juicy ones, but I think it was too young to understand them. The brothers had been the top brass during this time had either been kicked out or sat at the back. Um I remember in London there was Cyril Bing. He, he became [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=854s) Renton and Eric Burr also became a Renton and I remember they, they were, you know, very vociferous in this, during these times that the system, I think they call it, is very vociferous, a commercial system. But then they all ate humble pie and they sat at the back and you know.

Um well meanwhile we were getting all new rules every week dictated by Big Jim, Big Jim Taylor in New York. Um no pets, no holidays, no working on Saturdays. We didn't actually have pets but, I'm, I'm a great animal lover but in those days I wasn't used to animals. But I remember my aunt having to get rid of her cats and [budgerigar and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=907s) it was, you know, it was the sads. I just thought it was fucking stupid. Excuse my French.

Well I, I found, I was about 13, 14 by this time. I just found Brethren life absolute drudgery, absolute drudgery. Um you had to write off a Sunday. There's nothing you could do on the [Sunday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=937s) Yeah, it's that, you know, the new rule came in, they called it the Essential Occasion, the breaking of bread, that that was now starting at 6am. Um and the whole thing went through until six o'clock in the evening. I mean 12 hours just absolutely drudgery and boring. I can't even tell you anything that was safe there. 

Um but now these days you had to write off Saturdays as well. You know, you had Saturday morning meeting and the dreaded fellowship meetings. Uh you know, I just used to start getting into a good book on a Saturday morning, I’m dragged off to a fellowship meeting. I really began to hate the [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=989s) bloody nonsense of the Exclusive Brethren. Um uh I remember at school on a Monday morning, you know, we boys were chatting about our activities over the weekend and one boy says that he went camping with his father and his cousin and another boy said, no we did all this. I think what could I possibly, just sat the whole weekend through the most endless [hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1019s) of boring religious meetings of which I had absolutely no interest or relief, belief in at all.

 There are some things I can remember though, some funny things. I can remember a local meeting in Sydenham in South London and the, the, the script they were reading was about the sun standing still and I just thought to myself, if you couldn't believe that, you couldn't believe anything. And the sun reversing on itself and they were dead serious it really happened. And then one, one brother at the end of the meeting, and I'll tell you his name, his name was Mr Gill. He was a bus conductor I believe. Um his hairstyle was a bit like a hedgehog. He asked a question. He said, well it wasn't the, it wasn't the sun that stopped, it was the actually the earth stopped rotating. And then this Mr Bing said, [no,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1079s) no, we can't say that. The Bible didn't say that. You know, looking at it from from a 21st century perspective, I can now understand why some people get scammed by these Nigerian con artists. Well yes, believe in a Nigerian princess is going to give you, that pales in comparison to believing that the sun [reversed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1110s) So basically.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1111s)

Basically they were going back about 500 years to the idea that the the earth is stationary and the sun goes around it, which I think was it Galileo or Copernicus disproved. Um well that's Galileo got excommunicated by the Catholic church didn't he for stating that the that the sun was the center the solar system not the earth.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1133s)

Yeah, and he had, he had to recant but then, but then, he, he said he pointed to his telescope, he was pointing to Jupiter's moons and he said, they still move.

Uh oh, another, another some very, very good advice which I'd like to pass on to you which I got from the preaching. Um don't be a Sadducee, Yes, because they'll make you sad, you see. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1164s)

Only they practice what they preach.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1171s)

Um anyway, you know, I just found the whole thing so utterly boring and and I, I, I just decided, no, I, I just planned I would leave school and I would leave the religion, I'll get a job and blah, blah, blah, blah. And and you know, the first thing I was going to do when I leave this awful religion was to join the Boy Scouts and that's exactly what I did, you know, because I love the open. I became an exploration geologist but I, I mean, I, I just love [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1201s) the the outside and all these things.

Um oh God, all the funny things, that everything that I was interested in was banned or distinctly frowned upon.

I am a great lover of classical music. I always have been. I don't really play any instrument very well, but I'm a great lover of classical music. I absolutely love it. Now, in my day, don't forget we're talking about 1960s. The the reel-to-reel tape, magnetic tape recorder was permitted but yeah, vinyl LP records were not. They didn't mind music coming from magnetic tape but they objected it [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1261s) coming from a plastic record. Um now this presented problems because I used to borrow the records. I had a reel-to-reel tape recorder, my father bought it for me, you know, it was, it was all okay. But I borrowed the LPs from, from the library, local library. But then I had to go to a friend's house, to a [school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1291s) friend's house to get the recording on my tape, you see. Of course, I mean that, that my friend's father just could not understand, well what, you know.

Not only that, I had to pretend that I was going to the swimming baths, you know, because I couldn't obviously say that I was going to a school friend's house.

So I had to take my swimming things with me and then say, oh I've got to go home now, can I just put these in the sink and get them wet. They just could not, understandably, they could not understand at all what it was all about.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1334s)

So did you, did you add a little bleach just to get the right chlorine smell?

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1338s)

I know, I wasn't that, I didn't quite have that vision. Oh anyway, uh it was so, it was so bizarre. Um another thing I used to do but my father used to get the British Daily Telegraph every day. He was an insurance underwriter. It was before the days of Brethren businesses and all that. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1369s) was a highly respected insurance underwriter in the city of London.

And every evening he used to come home with the Daily Telegraph, which I used to read from cover to cover.

I probably glossed over the sports pages because it didn't really mean very much to me as a PB. Um but on Friday there was a special treat because it came with the color supplements, the weekend Telegraph magazine. And I was enthralled by this magazine and I even went to see the editor. I was thinking I, I want to become a journalist, a science journalist. And uh you know, I went, I went to [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1417s) offices in Fleet Street in London and and I saw the editor and they, they, you know, I was in school uniform, they even took me to lunch and you know, they were quite happy to have it that's cool. Of course I was leading an absolute double life. Yes. Um but it was all exciting, you know, to do these things. I miss it now, yeah. Um but sometimes that my father [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1447s) to come home with the magazine with a page ripped out. And why did you rip the page out? Oh, you know, some reason. So I thought, well, I have to get the magazine and find out what this was. Um so so I, I, I, uh, you know, and there was a,, one of the, one of the,, the things he'd ripped out was an advert with a, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1478s) don't know what the advert was, but it showed a girl which I suppose she was revealing a bit more than he would have liked. But what he didn't know was I'm gay.

But anyway, that's another issue which I'm coming to. Um oh and another time, he didn't bring back the magazine full stop. And this was a thing that I was, I was actually following. I'm very, very interested in astronomy and, well I'm a geologist, but planetary geology. And this was a three-week serialization and the third copy he didn't [bring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1522s) home. He said, no, no, they, it was, it was all very evil and they were talking about God as just the, the Hebrew God and all that. So the first thing I to go and get in a magazine. Um but so I mean it's not just Exclusive Brethren. Um in South Africa during apartheid times, the, uh there are many books which were banned so I just made sure I read them. Yeah, Salman Rushdie's, what was the book [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1553s) was banned here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1554s)

Satanic Verses, yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1556s)

Satanic Verses. I was one of the first to read that. I had to read it because it was banned.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1562s)

Yeah, there's no, no, no better way to make everyone, make sure everyone reads something than to...

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1571s)

If I lived in Florida, I'd be the best read person in the whole state.

Um yeah, oh about this time, I'm talking about about 1968, one of the local brothers was by the name of David Burgess and he was kicked out. Um oh there's been a lot of stuff about it recently. Now I don't quite remember the reasons but he was involved in the Stow Hill depot, something along the lines. But anyway he was kicked out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1611s) he wrote a three-part serialization in a British tabloid, the Sunday tabloid, The Suicide Sect.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1621s)

Yeah, I've read it. I've got a copy of that.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1623s)

Article. Yeah, yeah, I've recently read it as well. But I read it at the time. I had to go out and get the paper and I read it. And uh, and then I thought that this would be a good opportunity for me to call my very good friend, his name is John Anstey, he was the editor of the Daily Telegraph magazine. I want to write an article about this religion. My parents belong to it.

And he said, well they don't really do stuff like that. I was trying to sell my story.

And I, I, anyway, it's a long story, I will talk about that later. But oh yeah, and then little things like anybody who watches this podcast who is my age, will, from, from the south of England will know the Park Street, City Hall. And it was set back from the main road and there was a long passage going to the hall from the road. And I remember I was about 15, [14,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1687s) 15, I remember standing at the, at the entrance of this passage and watching all the Brethren go out and onto the streets. And it was just after this headscarf rule with all the sisters with their hair flowing down to there. And I thought, it's just a religion. It's nothing more, it's nothing less. It's a religion and a rather stupid one at that, you know. And hey, I used to remember being forced to help out with the microphones after a Saturday meeting at Park Street. Hey, I was furious.

Um now I, I had a lot of personal problems. I had actually behavioral problems. Um I used to mess around at school, at home. I had nowhere to let off steam. Yeah, I used to look out of the window at fellow friends, school friends of mine playing. I wasn't allowed to join them. Uh I was locked up [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1758s) my bedroom for being naughty day in and day out. I am telling you, I was in a living hell for a 14-year-old. Um and I'd just come out as gay at school. It wasn't probably the best thing to do at the time.

It didn't really help me but uh, I had that, I had all these things. So I, I, I just planned to leave school after what we call the, the O levels. I don't know if they still have this system. So it was a 16-year-old, yeah. Um I was going to, I wasn't going to stay on and do A levels. I just wanted to leave home, get a job and off, you know, that's what I wanted to do. [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1804s) by pure chance was June 1970\.

I left school in July 19, in June 1970\. I applied for a lot of local boring jobs. I just wanted to go and study and get my university entrance requirements part-time. And lo and behold, we have Aberdeen incident. Everything was handed to me on a plate. It was simple. It was just so absolutely [simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1841s) and I will never forget it. Um it was Tuesday the 28th of July 1970\. I was 16\. I had just finished school and I was just about to get my first job.

And there were all these rumors.

Hush, hush, all these rumors about, did you hear, Big Jim was, he went mad at the three-day meetings or he was caught in bed with some woman and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I thought, this is juicy. Uh let's see what happened. So one, one meeting that I actually really wanted to go to, probably the only one, was the city reading at Park Street on Wednesday the 29th of July 1970\.

And I had my little moped. My father had bought me this thing, I think just to try and mollify me, you know, some way. But anyway, I went to Park Street on this thing and before the meeting starts, Mr Eric Burr, he grabs a microphone and he proceeds to tell everybody his [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1929s) of the alleged events at Aberdeen. And they tried to silence him. They switched off the system, the microphone system. But  I had sat on my own in the balcony.

And there was no one missing this. This is the best, you know, we don't, we don't, we, we, we don't need any entertainment, not with this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1960s)

This was the first time it was actually interesting.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1964s)

Yes, yes. Oh my god, I just wish that it would have been possible to video us at the time. But then, a whole bunch of them walks out. David Davis led the people to walk out and about, I don't know, half the meeting, maybe a third of the meeting. They will, I, I can't really tell you how many, but a good chunk, less than half, but a good chunk of the Brethren walked out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=1994s) some of them dilly-dallied and, and they went back in again, sadly for themselves because they, they, I'm not going to give names here, but they walked back in and they had a lot of problems, you know. But anyway, that was that. That was the last meeting I went to. And I, I, uh on the, on the way home, I stopped at some friends of mine. They're actually former Brethren. They'd been withdrawn from earlier that year but were good friends of mine. I went and I told them all the, [exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2032s) what happened. They were intrigued.

And that was that. Now I stayed with the Aberdeen people just for a couple of weeks or so until all the hoo-ha died down, until the dust had settled. Um but then, and I'd started a new job, but then Eric Burr said he, he tried to control my life and I told him to eff off. I think I was the only brother that actually physically… [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2066s) that was it. And that was it. I just did my own thing.

And well I very, I shortly, I did move into a flat with some friends and I'm not quite sure if I could say I lived happily ever after, but what I did do is I began to surf a wave.

Um and I still believe 54 years later, I'm still surfing that wave. Yeah, I know life hasn't been a bed of roses. I've made my share of mistakes but if I'm ever feeling a bit sorry for myself or a bit uh down and out, so not that I, I ever get depressed, but if, you know, if I think, you know, I just think to myself, oh my [god,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2120s) just imagine what, you know, I just got out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2126s)

Yeah, just thankful for what you escaped from, yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2129s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2129s)

And escaping at a young enough age to have a decent life left.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2134s)

Yeah, yeah. Um well I, uh my new life had started. I mean, I to this day, I celebrate the 29th of July as my independence day. I love it. I, I've got three, three, three days I celebrate in a year. There's my birthday in November, there's the 29th of July, which is independence day, and my cat's birthday. He's 16, which [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2165s) now know to be the 18th of December, but I was previously celebrating it in August. So is this you at 16? Uh no, no, this is me at 22\. Okay. Um uh this, I'm coming to this bit. I was a student, but I'll come on to that bit. I left when I was 16 and I'm now 22\.

Um I, yeah, no, I discarded everything. I discarded my surname. Um my father says Charles Barber. I kept the Charles bit but I discarded the Barber bit.

And then of course I had such a laugh after I left. I had a lot of friends, nothing to do with the Brethren at all. And I just never looked back on the Brethren. It's only with the advent of social media I've actually ever thought about the Brethren.

I used to have some naff, there was an elderly brother, I don't think I'd perhaps better give his name, but a long deceased now, but an elderly brother in the north of London.

And I called him and I faked an Australian accent. I think I would cringe if I could hear that now because I'm no good at doing accents. And I, I phoned him as Joe Blogs or whatever, made up some name from, from Australia. And I said, I remember you. And then we had a conversation, oh yes, the three-day meetings and JT Boston 1951, that's, that's three years, two years [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2278s) I was born. I said, yes, yes. And oh we, and I used to regularly phone, phone this, this elderly brother up. It was so funny and I really used to laugh. And then, I called him one Sunday morning very, very early at about, before they went to the supper, it was about past four in the morning. I called him and I pretended I was calling from Sydney and I said, we've had the rapture this morning [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2308s) I've been left behind and I just have to be.

Oh, it was such a laugh.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2319s)

That's funny. I thought you were going to say you were calling from heaven and you couldn't see him anywhere.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2324s)

I think he would have probably believed that. Um okay, I, I had a job. I worked for a petrol station. Um I worked for an insurance company, like, like father, like son, I suppose. Um I became a claims clerk at an insurance company in the city, but you know, my lifestyle and I, I had to work, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2354s) another job. I also worked in the petrol station and eventually I also worked in the gay bar in Vauxhall in South London. I still managed to study though. I managed to get my A-levels part-time. Um nothing fantastic, but it allowed me to to do what I wanted to do. Very hard work, but I was free. Absolutely no regrets. And then I decided I'm going for a trip around the world, you know, make up for all these things. And uh I went to Belgium. I got a, I went on on North Sea Ferries from Hull. I, I actually went to Hull to see what they, I wanted to get to Hull University. So they said, you know, when we chatted, you know, it was just an [informal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2408s) chat with one of the professors there. And then from Hull, I got the North Sea ferry to Zeebrugge in Belgium. And I thought, it's my trip around the world, this is my first stop. So I got off the ferry five o'clock in the morning. Well, where to? I can't remember now if I walked or if I got the bus. But it was along the seafront, not very far from Ostend [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2438s) Dunkirk, that sort of area. And it was about 11 o'clock.

And I thought, well, since I'm here, there's a bar. Since I'm here, let me go and have a drink. So I went into this bar. I said to the bar, yeah, I was the only one there. It was about midday.

I went into the bar and I said to the barman, I tried to speak French. I'm absolutely useless at languages. I'm really sorry, I'm useless at languages, but I tried my best. I spoke French to the barman and asked him if he'd got a job, have you got any employment yet? And the barman looked at me and then he laughed at me [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2492s) he said to me in impeccable English, he says, first of all, he says, your French is useless, don't bother with it. Sort of deflated me a bit. And then he said, secondly, we don't actually use French here, we use Walloon as our local language. But he says, yes, we are looking for someone as a sort of general handy, well not handyman, but a general help, a driver, a cleaner, sort of thing.

Um but you have to come back when they, when the boss is here, because,, you know, you see what he says. But he'll be back in about half an hour, but never about an hour, just come back at one o'clock. So I said, okay. So I thought, well, let me take a walk down the beach and, you know, kill some time. But as I was going out, he, they said, no, the, the boss is here. And they offered me a job and I, I know, work there in the bar, by pure coincidence. And it really was coincidence, so it wasn't planned at all. It happened to be a very gay friendly bar and uh I, I got somewhere and I met this guy in the bar, two weeks later who was a, a uh a ground, a land surveyor. And I don't know how he got this thing, but he was a, he'd got a, a contract in South Sudan, what is now South Sudan, getting soil samples.

And I've got a sort of business background and I've also done an A-level in geology. Um and I thought, well no, I can, and he offered me the job. So I went to South Sudan. Um but, it's just a brief thing. I then went to South Africa where I got permanent residence but I didn't stay there. I went back to Hull University. I did my degree in geology.

For the, the ink and I, I wrote a letter to my, my, my father saying, look, you know, I'm, I'm now doing this. No reply. No reply at all.

Oh, I had some adventures in South Sudan. I went to Ethiopia, got kicked out of Ethiopia because there was a communist revolution. This had been 1974\. I had to flee to Kenya. But it was all... I loved adventure. That's what I missed in the Exclusive. Better than sitting through a fucking boring fellowship meeting.

Um well I went to Hull University. Um unsurprisingly nobody believed my story. I just kept quiet. I think I was going to get a reputation for making things up. Um just a few tears. I think the only time when I graduated, fellow students were there with their parents and yeah, just realized where I'm coming from. Um short-lived. 

But uh well the ink wasn't even dry on [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2700s) degree certificates and I went to Zimbabwe as a school teacher. Wow. Three years contract in Zimbabwe immediately after independence and Mugabe was a good boy in those days. There's a lot of goodwill. Um I then went to Kenya, for a year as a science teacher and then I started my career as a geologist. I started as a very [junior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2730s) geologist in Botswana in gold exploration and then I moved to South Africa in 1988\. I became a citizen. Um platinum and chrome exploration. I've made it my home. 1997 and I decided to father a child. We're very close. His mum is a Zimbabwean but there's nothing messy about [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2760s) divorce or anything like that. So we're all very good friends.

My son lived with me, he's now 27\. He's an IT guy.

I was a consulting geologist until 2011 when I joined the staff at the University of Limpopo as a lecturer in geology and I retired. I was forced to retire as acting head of department in 2022, a couple of years ago. Now I'm a voluntary maths teacher at a rural school and writing textbooks for a living. So I, I am really [enjoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2805s) things. Well I've got some, two close relatives. I have a, both my, my mother's, my mother was the eldest in her family and I have an uncle. He actually passed away last year, but his name is Brian Evershed. He was never in. He never broke bread. And he moved to Switzerland. He worked for CERN for [most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2835s) of his working life. He was an electrical engineer. He was a very good uncle to me. He treated me really almost like his own son but he was very good.

 We, we had our disagreements. Um we had some serious disagreements but they were all very avuncular, you know, there's nothing, nothing bad. And I was very happy. When I was a student, I used to spend my summer holidays with him, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2866s) outside Geneva. Of course I'm talking about the days well before or email. We used to write to each other, the so-called snail mail. And I also have an aunt who I'm in touch with. She's 86 now, who lives in the south of England and you know, she left at Aberdeen and we've always been in touch. Her husband passed away a few years ago [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2896s) we've always been in touch and even my son when he goes to the UK, he goes around and sees those. It's the only relative really. But anyway, unknown to me, I don't know whether to thank them or to attack them for this, but they were leaking some of my letters to my parents. They thought that this was a good [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2926s) because I was telling them about my life and what I was doing and blah, blah, blah, blah. 

And then I had a boy, the son who who was born in 97\. And I said to my aunt, so I said, I wonder if my, you know, I pick up my son now, he's a baby and I suppose my [parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2956s) would have picked me up at that age but they hate me, you know. So my aunt actually wrote to her sister, my mother, and said, no, this is what your son thinks of you, you know, you call yourself Christians. Um do you want, do you want your son to to think that you hate him? And I didn't know that she'd done that. And I got a letter [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=2987s) of the blue from my father. It was a, if I can call it a letter, and if I can call him my father, biologically yes, I suppose a sperm donor I think would be a better term. But I got a letter, it a two-liner and he just said that the suggestion has come to us that uh we hate you. How wrong that is. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3017s) blah, blah, blah, blah. Um and to give him credit, he was, he wanted forgiveness.

And so I actually called him. And it was before the days of WhatsApp. It was at an expense of from South Africa to London. And we had a chat.

And he wanted to give me some money and all that, because my father was, he was a child abuser.

I had to say that. I don't mean in a sexual way, but it's certainly to lock a kid up. I, yeah, he was a pretty nasty man to me anyway. And he, he was physically violent. He used to beat me and kick me and all sorts of things and I don't even know what my crime was. And he, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3079s) obviously realized this and he, he was, I think genuinely sorry that he'd done all these things. And uh he, he wanted me to forgive him.

Well, I don't harbor grudges. I said, fine, I'll come and visit you then. And then in the same breath, he says, no, no, I don't want to see you in my life. I don't want you anywhere near my house and blah, blah, blah. So I'm afraid I just told him to go and fuck himself. What can you do?

So that was a funny thing.

A bit later, a bit later on, this is about 2001, 2001, 2002, I had a letter from my sister, my elder, elder of my two sisters.

My sister in inverted commas, it was, they had this system of what they, there was a name for it. Um that they asked, trying to get people to come back. What did they call that? There was a word that they used. The review, the review, that's it, the review. Um it was part of this review, a wrong judgment or whatever they called it. And [well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3166s) I chatted with her but she's full of a load of nonsense, but just chanting slogans actually, “Brethren speak” as I call it. So that happened. My father died in 2007\. At least they informed me for what it was worth, although I never contacted them after that. My mother died in 2016\. [Again,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3196s) I was informed, and surprisingly, I even received a small inheritance.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3203s)

Wow. Were you invited to the funeral? Did they ask you if you wanted to go to the funeral?

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3209s)

I never followed it. I knew she was ill but she was nothing to me. I would like to say that publicly. My, I don't love my parents and they're absolutely nothing to me. Um yeah, I understand that. Yeah, yeah. Um I wouldn't have gone even if they'd invited me. I, I didn't even answer their correspondence, you know. But I'm aware that they, they,, they passed away. I never really thought anything about the Brethren at all. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3239s) never crossed my mind. You know, months, years, I never thought anything about it. I was busy with my own thing. I never had any emotional ties to it. I was glad to be out of it all until the early 2000s and I stumbled across Dick Wyman's site. And then I thought, oh my God, no, I didn't realize that people had such anguish, you know, in leaving the Brethren. You know, I, I just didn't realize. Um I had no idea that people suffered so much. And uh I think I'd just like to, sorry I've been rambling on, but I'd just like to say if there are any young Brethren watching this podcast, my advice to you from the bottom of my heart, get out now before, [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3301s) you're trapped.

And I think that really sums my life. I have no grudges against them. Um I have no bitterness. I have no sorrows. Um in fact, I, if I want to live my life again, it's the only thing I know, you know, it's, I say, say I profoundly thank my parents for, I think I stood on, I, I was able to stand on my own two feet probably a lot earlier than I should have [done,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3333s) but I was able to do it and I had such behavioral problems when I was a kid, but they just evaporated in 1970 when I left the religion.

And so uh, well that's, that's basically my story. Um I, I, uh yes, okay, that, show those, those pictures, that the one that you showed just now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3361s)

Hang on, I'll bring the pictures up.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3363s)

Yeah, and I'd just like to show you, let...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3366s)

Let me go to the very beginning, let me go to the first one.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3368s)

Okay, oh, that, that's me as a little boy. Um this would have been about 1958\. Funnily enough, I can actually remember that picture being taken. I can, I can actually remember it. I can remember the camera.

Wow, a Brownie box camera. Wow. Um that was when I was a student. That was in 1977, so I'd already been out seven years by the time.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3401s)

That's a classic isn't it with the flared, the flared jeans and the kind of the Beatles hairstyle.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3408s)

Yeah, it's, well we all dressed like that at the time. It looks bizarre now. I showed it to my son and he said, well the, the, he can tell it's me but you'd have to really know me to, yeah, yeah. Um oh this is much, uh this is, this is, uh much more recent. This is [2016\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3439s) Um I was on a gay pride, here in Mokopane in South Africa. Um so I'm with a few local friends and we're just chilling for the day. The Gay Pride is always in May and it's, of course, May is the middle of our winter. So it's a bit chilly.

Okay, this is the culmination of my career. This is, I'm a lecturer at the University of Limpopo.

I'm, you can pick me out there. I'm with a bunch of my research students on what we call the Limpopo Mobile Belt, which is in the far north of South Africa, not far from the border with Zimbabwe.

I don't know what year it was. We planned, this is the same trip.

Um every September we, we plan a trip there with the research, actually this is the third year, this is not research group, this is the third years.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3517s)

So this looks like some very intricately folded rock formations you're standing on.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3524s)

Absolutely, yes. It's, it's called the Sand River Gneiss. It's, it's uh, well I won't go into a long geology lecture now, but uh, uh it's, it's uh, uh highly contorted with with two cratons or continental masses collided with each other, about two and a half thousand million years ago. [Wow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3554s)

Limpopo orogeny. It's basically, it's the Zimbabwe craton and the, the, uh the, uh Kaapvaal Craton which is in South Africa and they collided and you get this mashed-up…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3568s)

Richard and I would stay for an hour lecture on this. Not sure all the listeners want to hear it, but we would.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3577s)

You understand this was all actually created 6,000 years ago, Chris, I assume.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3583s)

Well, I think probably the majority of the saints would probably believe that, but then they also believe in talking snakes and the reversal of the rotation of the earth and all sorts of other funny things.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3597s)

They believe in Bruce Hales, which is even more bizarre.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3602s)

I want to go back to something that you had said about your behavioral problems that you were having in there and how they, they went away when you left. And this is an issue that we're coming up against quite heavily right now inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is, the, the word that they've used for many, many, many years is you're mental, right, you're mental. And for those that have reached out to us with this issue that are still inside there and for those that are still [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3632s) with this label in there that I hope you can take solace in what Chris has explained that behavioral problems or what they call mental is the result of you being placed in a confined situation, being placed inside a church that has so many rules and regulations that it causes your nervous system to literally need to expel out what's being, what's being held within it. 

So I hope that you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3662s) just sit back when you listen to Chris's story about how all his behavioral issues left when he left the Plymouth, when he left Exclusive Brethren because it's not a “you” issue. This is an issue of your environment. When we are placed in an environment that is counterproductive to what we feel, you can't be placed in, you can't put a square peg in a round hole and that's what happens when you try and fit yourself into [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3692s) that you're not meant to fit into. So it has just been, it is something that's very, very heavily worded right now. They're just rampant with the word you're mental inside there right now because there is so much upheaval because there are so many people starting to see through this that this isn't a “you” issue. 

I want to point out the difference though between what you're being raised and I had a conversation with someone just this morning on this is, is therapy [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3722s) different than the box that they are using inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church as being labeled mental. Those are two different isolated situations. Therapy helps you unbrainwash your brain. It helps you take apart the process that you've been born and raised in so that you can see this freedom that you're allowed to have. What the Brethren have called mental and applied therapy or therapists to is [different.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3752s) The therapy that you're going to encounter when you leave the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is different than the situation between being called mental and going to some of their therapists. Completely two different things and I want you to make sure that you understand that that when we suggest therapy for you as soon as you leave or if we suggest therapy to you to help you get to leave, that is different than what the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church priests are calling you [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3783s) mental. Two different things.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3784s)

Yeah, Cheryl, I would add to that. I mean, I, I suppose I, I've always been the, wanted to be in the, to be the actor and the center of attention and all this. And of course, not being able to participate in school plays was,, I was, I was, I was very upset, you know, because I enjoy acting. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3815s) not particularly talented, but I enjoy it. And I suppose that's what it's all about. It's an outlet for you. Yeah, yes, yes. And I love that sort of thing. Um but I wasn't, obviously I wasn't allowed to be part, you know, part of a school play. But the, the, the drama teacher at school, he really liked me. He said, no, you can do this role, you know, you can play Hamlet or what, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3845s) know, whatever. But of course, I couldn't. There's so many things I couldn't do. I, I used to argue, argue with my, with my, my, my father the whole time. I made his life hell. I, I didn't do it to make his life hell. He made his own life hell by being a member of the Exclusive Brethren. Yeah, yeah.

But I, I didn't do it out of spite, but I was just, everything was confrontational, everything. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3875s) when I was at school, in English literature O level, I don't know how I was allowed to do that because I think English literature was banned. But anyway, I did it and we did, on one of the plays that we did was a Shakespeare play, was Twelfth Night. So, what used to be the Inner London Education Authority [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3906s) on a play, Twelfth Night, especially for our school kids. It's a theater. So I went to it and I openly went to it and I said, I'm going to it. It's up to you if you want to make a big thing about it, do it, but I'm still going to this thing. Um and I did and nothing ever happened, you know, nobody said anything.

 I made up the most obscene poems, but I certainly can't read them out on this podcast, [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3936s) members of the Brethren, which, which I couldn't possibly. And I openly gave it to to big shots in the religion and they thought it was funny. I know. And it was all about so and so being a rapist and, I'm sure you've heard about our club, the club with seven members of all the fire of flaming hell, we are the glowing embers. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3966s) have conditions of the bar, but I won't say the rest of it. It gets a bit crude. And the, but the unabridged things, I wrote all these things. Um but but then I, I just got shoved in a corner with this and this and this. I used to open my father's ministry books and just write off and close it and put it back in. I used to write far more obscene things than that, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=3997s) you know, it, it's not something my own son, would never, ever dream of doing something like that to me. But then I don't lock him in his bedroom.

Yes, that's the difference. Yeah, I don't shove nonsense down his throat, you know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4019s)

In the Brethren they talk quite openly about your will being broken and they're going to break your will and they mean it in just the same sense as a wild horse is broken and that's what they quite openly try and do. And I mean either you break or you fight back and you, you fought back, well.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4045s)

You see, there's another thing I forgot to mention.

Uh I, I guess this was in the late 60s. I would have been about 14, 15\. Um I used to go to the cinema at least twice a week. I used to watch all the new films that came out. I remember The Graduate, Dustin Hoffman, that came out in 1969\. I went to the local cinema to see it.

Then other films, all the Carry On films I used to see.

And they, I, I used to, I used to go to or see all the films. I, ust tried to live a normal life but it was such a pretense. It was really so stupid. But I tried my best to just be a normal person. But then you see, I like to be the center of attention and I did the most stupid things which after I left the Brethren, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4120s) was just no need to do such things. Yeah, like, yeah, I don't wish to be crude or anything, but I, we had a teacher, called Miss Daz, D-A-Z. Now at that time, Daz was a brand name of a, a washing, a dishwashing liquid.

So uh I, one of the boys said, said to me, why don't you call her 10 soap or something like that. So I did, you know, I did. It's a big laugh for the class and all that, make us into trouble naturally. Um one of the, one of the boys, this is a boys school, he said to say, ask the French teacher, and she was French and I actually [since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4175s) quite recently, I've become friends with her. She, she, she was, it's a long story anyway, but I asked the French ma'am, what is French for sanitary towels? And I asked her this question. It was really so stupid, you know, pathetic, you know, but I just got a kick out of it because, you know, what [else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4205s) is going to make me laugh?

Um we, we used to have, this was amongst the Brethren, we used to have this thing in London in the meeting called the Plims Gambling Association or the PGA. And we used to bet on who was going to give the word in the ministry meeting on a Tuesday. So that was the one meeting I wanted to go to because we're laying bets on you. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4238s) used to bet, this was a totally Brethren thing. And in those days, it was before decimalization of the currency, so it was like sixpence or a shilling. And then I remember at getting all three right once. Ah, so please.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4255s)

We're going to be giving Bruce Hales and his son's new ideas here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4265s)

It's too predictable these days, it's the same people every time.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4268s)

Yeah, and then the, the thing is though that, the, the people that, the, the young Brethren who were all part of this funny story, we've all gone our separate ways. There's those like myself have nothing to do with it whatsoever, those have gone into Rentons and those who are still with the, the Taylor, whatever it's called, the PBCC. Yeah, so it's, uh no, it's, it's, in a bizarre way, I don't regret, I, I don't know how I can really say this, but I, I don't regret where I come from.

Um I used to keep quiet about it because I didn't think anyone would believe me. Yeah, and but now it's, it's easy because you can just refer them to the media and social media and it's so easy to see. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4330s)

I want to go back to July 29th, 1970\.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4335s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4336s)

I want to, can you, I want to sit, now that I know that you can, you do, did poetry, you've got words to articulate this. Can we go back to that moment in time? Can you articulate a little bit more in depth what that was like sitting there when everybody started getting up and walking out? We've never really had somebody on here get in and really articulate the, the air of the room and like what that was like for everybody. What was that like for you as a 16 [year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4366s) old?

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4366s)

Well okay, the Park Street meeting room was, there was a platform and then there was the main body of the hall and then there was the, the galleries, on three walls facing the platform. Now in a, in a weekday meeting, nobody sat in the gallery unless you came in late and then you might sit in the gallery.

Um but I used to sit in the gallery on my own, completely on my own. I used to bring a book with me and I used to, nobody could see, and I used to read. Um I even used to listen to the radio. I had a transistor radio and uh, uh you know, it was all a big kick for me to get away with this. Um but but then, so I was on my own [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4432s) I knew, everybody knew that something was going to happen. So I had a bird's eye view of everything. If only we had the cell phones in those days.

So, uh well I sat there and the first thing that happened was Eric Burr, who was quite a big shot but I would hardly really call him a Taylorite, you know, he, he, he was certainly very vociferous but wasn't quite, it didn't, he's not tarred with the same brush as the, the Big Jim people. Sorry if I call this Big Jim because that's when I left, so I was. And so he, I didn't particularly like him.

But anyway, he stood up, well I don't know if he stood up or sat down, but he, he got a mic and then he began to tell us, what transpired at Aberdeen or what he alleged, that transpired at Aberdeen. That's probably the right way of putting it.

He told us about the indiscretion and the fact that he was found in bed with Madeline Kerr.

He told us that he went, he was speaking some nonsense in, in the meetings and he was drunk.

And the Brethren didn't like this and I can't remember if they told him to stop speaking, but they certainly turned the sound system off. So he was shouting this, but I could hear him quite well. I was in the gallery and he was carrying on and he was saying all these things. And then some of the Brethren, some of the big shots there, the big Taylor fans, they were having none of this. And led by David Davis, who I've since met, that's another story, led by David Davis, they, they just said, no, we're withdrawing from iniquity. And they walked out. Wow.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4594s)

So it was the Taylorites who walked out and, yes, right, okay, yes.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4600s)

Absolutely. And funnily enough, my parents stayed in. I would have thought that they would have walked out, but they walked out. And they, and then after a while, David Davis and a few others walked back into the room to try and get the leading brother who was AJG, Mr Gardner, [Alfred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4631s) Gardner. Um they tried to get him to go out with them but he really didn't know what was going on. He really didn't know what was going on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4644s)

And how was the talking going? Were they yelling? Were they shouting? Were they, was it like, how, how was this conversation? Like how escalated were the conversations?

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4654s)

I don't recall anybody really shouting. Okay. Apart from Eric Burr, but he was shouting to be heard.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4662s)

Yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4663s)

Okay. Um, I don't recall.

There, there, there must have been, I'm trying to remember back 54 years.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4673s)

Yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4673s)

Uh there must have been some shouting. There must have been. You don't just get up and and you know, walk out of a meeting and withdrawing from iniquity and all that without some shouting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4690s)

And did some of those people that got up and walked out, was it wives and children too or was it just the men do you remember? 

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4698s)

There were some of my, Brethren of my age who walked out, independently. Uh but the people who did walk out were the very people that you would think would side with Big Jim on this thing. And then I don't know what happened after that. They must have had some care-meeting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4728s) I think that the Big Jim people just withdrew from everybody who had opposed Big Jim. And although I didn't say anything, I just didn't go to any more of their meetings. I was obviously one of them. I was, I was quite happy. The funny thing was, I stayed on the other side with the Aberdeen people. It's just a matter of days and then I walked out on them. Uh but then, then there was a big issue, now we're going to withdraw from you and you're shut up [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4765s) all that, but I'd always be gone.

Wow. So everyone, everyone withdrew from everyone else.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4774s)

Yeah, yes. Uh that was really what happened then. I was totally out of the EBs. I have no idea what happens there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4789s)

You took your chance. You took the door that was wide open for you. And the reason why I was asking is there's a lot of people in there that are waiting for a moment like this to happen again in there, right? Like I have, there's many people that have that one foot in, one foot out, just waiting for some door to fly right open that gives them that same door that you took, right, where it's like you didn't really care what was happening, but this was your easy way out of just walking out this door and everybody, nobody would question you, right?

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4818s)

Yeah, yeah. Because yes, I had plans to leave but I, I planned it because, I need to get a job and I need to find a place to live and all that. But then everything was just handed to me on a plate. It was just so simple.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4836s)

There was, kind of like the ATO raids that are happening right now. Um and so I mean to those people inside who are looking for that door, it might come, it might not come, but you definitely have an opportunity to walk out with what's going on right now. Um you know, I'm not sure when this is going to air. It'll probably be a few, few weeks from when we've recorded this. But you know, as it is right now on April 13th, we're recording this, as the ATO raid is still happening. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4867s) I mean, for those of you that are telling yourselves that, you know, this is a regular normal audit, this is not a regular normal audit. I mean, we're how many days into this or how many weeks into this? This doesn't even sound like a normal raid happening at this point. 

And people are questioning that. Like I've got people questioning me like, what do you know about raids? Is this even a normal raid? And I mean, if I was to sit back and look at it, to me, it doesn't even look like a normal raid. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4897s) you know, I mean, I always just tell people, please get a hold of Olive Leaf Network if you need help. It is set up in New Zealand and Australia, two of the biggest places that have the ex, they're the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church going. I mean, I know the UK is not set up as that, but you can still reach out to Olive Leaf Network. Um there's tons of people to help you. That's why we keep on doing these podcasts. It's why I had Neville McCallum come on to be able to tell the history. It's why I wanted you on, Chris, when I heard that you [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4927s) 16 years old sitting in that gallery watching this go down. I was like, you need to come on and tell your story because our generation, we don't know this. Like we don't know this history. And for those people who have one foot in and one foot out and when they can hear you tell your story on what it was like and how it went out, went down, it's important. It's inspiring. It's very inspiring to those people, especially that, you know, the younger generation that are sitting there like, hey, is this my door to [leave?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4957s) Um in my personal opinion, yes, it is your door to leave and just make sure that you know, you, you've got the support on the outside here. 

Therapy is super important, guys. Therapy is super, super important. Even how, when I left, when Richard left, when Chris left, what you're leaving is different than how we left. And therapy is even that much more important. I still went to a regular school. Um so I was still able to see that a lot of people that are in there, they [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=4987s) had regular schools. Like you're stuck inside an OSG, inside a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church school, which makes that brainwashing just a little bit more deeper. So make sure that you guys are reaching out for support. You are really understanding the truth of the matters that are going down right now. Don't listen to the priests in there. They're trying to cover this up. They're trying to throw this underneath the carpet. Read the newspapers. Michael Bachelard is very factual. [His](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5018s) articles are exactly what's going on down there. And no, nobody was paid to take the picture of Bruce Hales. That was literally done by a disgruntled member and it, nobody was paid. There was no money exchanged for it. I just want to make that clear.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5037s)

So if you're looking to make a fast buck, that's not the way to do it. We're quite happy to take, quite happy to receive any pictures you may send, but all you're going to get is our thanks.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5048s)

Yes, there's no money exchanging happening on these podcasts or people that bring us stuff. So yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5058s)

Well I'd just like to say one thing, you know, if you are, advertising, uh let's say, a supermarket chain, something like that, and your advertising and, you know, you've done your, you've done your training in advertising and and you come up with some slogan and you must buy this product and you know, you, you would know how to do it. But the Exclusive Brethren [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5088s) gone one step further. They've got a captive audience who have to buy. And they say, if you don't buy from us, you'll go to hell. They might not say, they might not say use those words, but that's what they infer. And and the worst thing about it, and I think that really if there's anything evil about this, it is brainwashing children.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5114s)

Yes.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5115s)

There is nothing good about Exclusive Brethren schools, nothing good at all. I think they'd be better off being illiterate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5126s)

Yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5127s)

Yeah, that's a very good point. Yeah, yeah. You know, you're, you, you are depriving them of the ability to think for themselves.

And that is evil. And I, I sincerely hope that the Charity Commission in, in the various countries in which they operate, are aware of this. Yes, because that, that is seriously wrong to indoctrinate a child, and to the extent that they can't even look after themselves.

Yeah, I agree. And I think that's the worst thing. You know, I, I could, I could probably,, forgive them for some of the things that they do, but not that. That, that is evil.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5178s)

Yeah, and it's also indoctrinated them to be so hateful towards, ex-members. It's indoctrinated them to have this and it gets handed down, that hatred gets handed down from the parents to the children. And then you end up with, you know, things like what Ben Woodbury's gone through, like death threats that now are being thoroughly investigated. Um and I feel bad for the children. I would welcome, my door is open to my nieces [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5209s) nephews any day, any day. Um my siblings probably not so much. I'd probably sit, have a conversation but I probably wouldn't let them stay here. Um my nieces and nephews welcome in my home any day because they are a product of it, right? My brothers and sisters are adults now. Um is my heart goes, my, my heart goes out and not that I mean my, they're all victims of the system. 

They are all victims of the system. But when you get to a certain age and you've got as [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5239s) information that is out there, right? Like use your God-given brain to realize like this is what's out there is so blatantly statistically a cult, a destructive cult, right? There's cults, I mean there's cults everywhere in this world now, but then there's destructive cults. The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is a destructive cult. And it's a destructive cult if you go back and watch [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5269s) hundred and however many podcasts we're at right now, April 13, that's 106 podcasts. By the time this airs, it's probably three or four more. But right, it is, we see the destruction that happens mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically with how these people try and leave, how these people can't leave, how they've kept them so in their cage and making them believe that they have the key to leave, but they don't have the key to leave.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5295s)

Yeah, I mean, I think the difference is between children and adults in there is that the children have no way of knowing any different other than what they're told. Now the adults are brainwashed, but there is also, because they're adults, there's also what they call willful blindness, which means that they're deciding, electing not to see, not to read, not to believe the truth of what's going on and that they are responsible, diminished [responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5325s) maybe, but they are responsible.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5327s)

Well the, the, the other thing of course is that those of my age, older, older than me will know the days of the system very well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5339s)

Yeah.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5340s)

Um I, I and but they're, they, they were presumably, they, they thought it was all wrong and evil at the time. Why is it okay now?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5351s)

Yes. You know, they've renamed it. They now call it the ecosystem. Oh yes, they revive the system and they call it the ecosystem. Makes it just a little bit greener, you know.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5361s)

Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, it might, all I would say is that, about the PBCC, just, just to summarize, I got away from it. I'm lucky. I'm one of the lucky ones. Um I don't have any baggage about that. But I just feel desperately sorry for those people who are trapped inside. Yeah. And [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5391s) you, if you, if you are trapped inside, it's not good for you to think about it, you know, you, you must think that no, this, this is the best place for me to be and this is God's choice for me and all that. Because if you don't and you question it, it's going to make your life very confusing because you know, you can't, you can't leave it. You're not going to leave your partner, your house, your business, your grandchildren, your or kids, what, blah, blah, blah. You're going to lose everything and you're not going to do it. So you, you better off just, you know, but if you can't beat them, join them sort of thing. Yes, just, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5443s) live with it. You're not going anywhere. I think I look, I'm, I'm, I'm only speculating. I have no idea, but I would imagine there must be many, many people trapped in there who the last thing they want on this planet is to be going to meetings and be part of this nonsense, but they're not going anywhere and they know it. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5470s)

My advice is just live your life. Start going to the cinema, start going camping, start taking holidays. Live your life as you want to live it and to me that is the best way to carve out this door, yeah, that is flashing “Let’s get out\!”.

### [**Chris Jones (Barber)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5487s)

Yeah, let's get out. Yeah, because I, I, I sometimes think to myself, you know, the thought comes to me, a Sunday morning, just a normal Sunday morning, I'm doing what I do on a Sunday morning and I think, my goodness, just imagine if this was 54 years ago, what would I be doing now? And then I look at the time difference in England, what would they be doing now? And [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5517s) you know, and I just feel so thankful that I'm not having to do that. And yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5525s)

Okay, well thank you so much Chris for joining us. I just want to remind everybody with all the chaos that is going on inside there, right, to please remember to reach out. I'm going to reiterate it again. Reach out to Olive Leaf Network. Um here are their emails. It's set up in New Zealand and Australia. There's, there's ways to move through what's happening inside there. So [please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5AYk7kyt4&t=5555s) reach out for support. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Chris, for joining us today. And until next time, everyone, much love to you all. Take care, everyone.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
