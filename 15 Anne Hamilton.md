### [**Announcer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=5s)

Today we are full of female power. Today with me I've got Carman and our special guest Anne Hamilton. We are going to dive into Anne's story and let her tell us where she's from and kind of how where she got to where she's at, what made her be kicked out and dive into all of that. Anne, do you want to take it away and let the listeners know where you're from?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=34s)

Yeah. Okay, so yeah, originally I was born in Northern Ireland and yeah, at the age of 18 I married a Brethren guy and because he was from Coventry I had to move there obviously. Just yeah rewind a little bit back to my childhood and that. I'm one of six children and yeah our family was always looked on as probably a little bit like yours Carman, a bit special. So my grandfather, first cousin to JT Junior. So my [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=87s) grandmother, yeah, my great grandmother, sister to JT Senior. So we were always sort of, I would say a bit of pride in our family. And my grandpa took the lead in Belfast when I was growing up until he died. Well, actually, no, that's wrong. He actually was shut up. Yeah. He was... So the reason he was shut up was my auntie, his daughter, my grandpa just had two children, my dad and dad's sister, auntie Mary. And my auntie Mary, she had got into a bit of an argument with her mother-in-law and pulled her mother-in-law's hair. And for that reason, for that reason, she was shut up her and her whole family six six or seven children I can't remember how many they were but they were shut up my grandpa he wasn't involved in the shutting up of them and he was upset he got he actually cried in the meeting and for that reason he was shut up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=166s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=167s)

Wow I mean it probably I don't because I was only like seven eight at the time I don't remember the actual timings but it was certainly very close he was shut up for six weeks and then Symington said it was wrong he should he shouldn't have been shut up so he was brought back and it probably in my mind it was only maybe three or six months later that he died suddenly. Um he was 74 so he's fairly young really but yeah very [sudden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=198s) death and according to Symington um the Lord took him because the the brethren didn't want him. So there was always a bit of a, you know, grandpa was a bit of a hero really in the brethren's eyes. Personally, I, as a child, I was actually quite scared of him. I don't know why I was a bit scared of men in general, and I was certainly scared of him. 

Anyway, after grandpa's death, my dad became the leader, which, yeah, it's exactly easy being a child of a leader in the brother you sort of yeah you're you sort of look down on a bit and whispered about and yeah but I was always a bit of a rebel I was a bit of black sheep of the family I suppose and um [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=251s) the age of 13 I would say I consciously questioned. And I didn't just question the brother and I just questioned everything. I questioned the Bible, really. And I started to make sort of bargains with God that, you know, well, if this happens, I'll believe you're right. You know, and I don't know if you've ever done that, but yeah. Yeah.

 And obviously I went to mainstream school as we did in those days. Didn't really have many friends with the, yeah, going home for lunch thing and all that. At the age of 16, me and my best friend, Silla, and my second cousin, Kenny, we were all very close and we consciously tried to leave. But we just couldn't do it. For a start, we're next to no education, we had no money, we knew we'd lose everything, and yeah we got well actually I couldn't bear to break my parents heart either. So from then on it was I suppose I just thought right I've got to get married. And the first three day meetings I went to I met my future husband and we smiled across the room a few times. And we secretly met behind the meeting. I was 17\. He was just 18\. And we had a little talk before I went home. And he handed me a 10 pound note that said, love you forever on it. We've spoken twice. That's how it was though.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=361s)

I just want to make the viewers, the listeners know what a three-day meeting is. So it's, yeah maybe just give them a little brief explanation of what a three-day meeting is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=375s)

Okay so a three-day meeting, I suppose it's a bit like a convention I suppose, so it was over three days and back then in the 80s it was at least two meetings a day wasn't it? So it started on, well we actually got there on the Thursday evening and then it started on the Friday. So you had, yeah, two meetings on the Friday, two meetings on the Saturday and then on the Sunday you had your normal four to five meetings. And it was sort of all geared towards having fellowship with each other really, I suppose. Getting to know other people, other brethren from other places, that sort of thing. And a lot of people did look up,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=418s)

That's where a lot of times you found your husband or wife, right?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=422s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. I knew there wasn't really anybody for me back home. We're quite interrelated in Ireland, so no, I think I'd struck most of them off my list. Anyway, maybe I would have been better marrying one of them than somebody I didn't know. So we had that. So I went home and then he wasn't allowed to have anything to do with me because he didn't have a house. So this was 1986\. Yeah, the end of 1986 that I met him. So he wrote me a letter and said he couldn't have anything more to do with me until he had a house. So it wasn't until March of 87 that he actually managed to buy a house. The booze, like, scraping money from here and there. And, you know, he didn't have much of a job, he worked for his dad. Anyway, we actually bought his parents' house because they were moving. 

So from March, we saw each other, from March to September when we got married, we saw each other once a month at Bristol Fellowship Meetings. Fellowship meetings there again just a one day thing but coming from Ireland you literally we would get on the ferry at about three o'clock in the morning on the Wednesday morning uh get the coach at the other side and travel eight hours to Bristol and have a meal if we got there in time if the boat wasn't delayed um and then yeah basically straight out well you had about an hour to talk after the meeting and then straight back home. So probably if you add that up, yeah, from March till September, we had an hour's conversation face to face.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=538s)

Wow. And that actually wasn't that unusual either. You know, that couples that would have that little to do with each other would get married.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=547s)

Yeah. Probably later on even less to be honest. Yeah. Yeah. Um so yes obviously he was from Coventry so that meant I had to go and live in Coventry and I don't know if you've heard the expression sent to Coventry but yeah it was a bit like that. Um yeah Coventry as regards brethren was well it is different places I've got different sort of set of rules almost haven't they?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=576s)

Yeah, sometimes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=577s)

Some are more extreme than others, aren't they? [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=580s) So certainly, I mean, Ireland was quite free as the Irish people are, you know, there was a lot of laughter and, you know, when we entertained each other and that sort of thing. So moving to Coventry was quite a shock to the system. But yeah, I wasn't, well actually, probably before I got married, it was actually in the July before I got married, I started to have doubts about marrying it. Just about something that he did to me in the back of a minibus, which I suppose looking back now was abuse, was wrong. At the time I was only thinking of it as wrong in the brethren eyes I suppose. Anyway, I didn't finish it. You know, my family said, Oh, everybody has these doubts and I didn't tell them why I have the doubts. And I wasn't very so I was 18 when I got married and I wasn't very long married. So yeah, I realized he wasn't very nice person. And yeah, the abuse started, I wouldn't say, okay, he did physically abuse me once, but I wouldn't say that was the main abuse. The main abuse was sexual and emotional abuse. 

And coercive control in the extreme. Part of that I thought of blame on living in Coventry and his life and also partly the way he was brought up. He was brought up very strict and never allowed to even see his sister in her nightdress when they were kids. You know, that sort of thing, which gave him a very, in my view, a very warped view of sex and women and yeah. So yeah, lived in Coventry for 18 years and had my five children there and a miscarriage. And in 03 I just got to the end of my tether really and yeah, I suppose had a breakdown. My parents got in their car, came over from Ireland over here and yeah just took me and the kids back with them. So the summer of 03 I spent in Warren Point with my parents. I don't really remember a lot of it because mum took me to the doctor and basically they just drug me up. So I slept a lot of that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=756s)

I don't remember too much. And your parents were still in at that point?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=762s)

Oh, my parents are still in, yeah. Yeah, they were in. Anyone of my family, yeah. And yeah, in 04 then, we decided to actually move to Warren Point from Coventry to be near to my parents. And I suppose, yeah, there was some... Life did improve a little bit in the sense that I have family around me and it was freer and that sort of thing. But as regards to sexual abuse and the state of our marriage, that just got worse. Wow. I think, I'm not excusing him at all, but I think he struggled moving places. It was like reverse role, you know, and he struggled. He didn't really fit in with the Irish sense of humour or, yeah, he struggled. And I was sort of almost just used like an antidepressant, really. And then things got I've never I don't think I've ever thought I've talked about this in my book but I've never sort of said it publicly but in 06 he what I know was raped, yeah he raped me. Maybe of course there's many other times a rape that I didn't class but this was an incident where I woke up to his hand over my nose and mouth and him trying to yeah he was raping me yeah.

 Um and I told my well I went I went to my dad mom's and I just went berserk basically. Um and you know they what could they do they sent me back to him you [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=876s) know. Yeah yeah. Um you know it was all this thing about not interfering in marriage and um so yeah I was sent yeah sent back to him. Um from that yeah from well actually earlier than that I had actually started taking contraception pill because and I and I was sort of given permission by my parents to do that because they knew the state of the marriage and my mental health as well. It was sort of alive. Although just before I left, they came to me, Dad and Mum came to me and said they'd been wrong in that and that I shouldn't be on contraception. 

But anyway. Anyway, and then I just started to, I questioned a lot of things. I think, I suppose, if my marriage hadn't been so bad, would I have questioned them? I don't know. But I suppose those questions from a 13 year old had never really left me. Anything happened. And that, you know that came to the forefront again every time. Um and then in 2010 Bruce Hales came to Warren Point and I just thought okay if this man is really God [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=965s) gonna talk to him I'm gonna get my answers my marriage is gonna get sorted everything is gonna all my questions will be answered if he is God. So at Warren Point meeting room is literally only meant for like 250\. It's just a flat meeting, it's not even tiered, it's a tiny room. And I think we got, we put special doors sliding doors on so that we could open into the foyer. I think we got 500, over 500 in that room. We were sitting literally sideways. We had no legroom. We were sitting sort of concertina sort of style, you know, crazy. And I asked for a meeting with Bruce Hales, but he had too many appointments.

 So I was given the option to sit at the end of a row so that when he came out on a certain day it had to be so it was on the Saturday morning so that as he walked out you know everybody stands up when he stands up and as he walked out the thing was that I was to get some sort of [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1039s) some sort of with him so yeah come the end of Saturday morning meeting I mean I was absolutely quick and you know this is the man of God and and you know he was Jesus They actually said that at the time that day because there had to be, it was so squished. They had little tiny school chairs within the circle for children. The little kids, I think they were [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1069s) sort of six up to eight kids, boys and girls, sitting in this circle. And we were told it was like the children sitting at Jesus' feet. And he even got, he even got like a little boy to speak. And I forget what was the word. Yes. The word the little boy asked was, what does, what does the word flattery mean?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1099s)

Out of the mouths of babes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1104s)

I love it. Yeah. I just remember how there was a roar of laughter at that. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, come Saturday after the meeting, I stood up, you know, all nervous. And I actually had a gift for him. So yeah, that's another story. But I started my own business in 08\. And I did like personalised chocolate. And yeah, I designed the wrappers for chocolate bars. And I got into like the tourist gift shops and that sort of thing. So I did this beautiful chocolate, a big, big bar of chocolate with an image of Warren Point. Because Warren Point is beautiful. It's at the bottom of the mountains of the Moor and it's absolutely beautiful. And it was a big picture of Warren Point, a sunset. Um you know when I think about it [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1160s) I you know across the front um you know to our beloved brother or something I don't know. I can't remember even what was on the front and I had as I thought to stop him I handed him this chocolate that was the way for me to stop him you know and then he just handed it the person behind without even looking at it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1182s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1184s)

And then he said what's your name. And I told him and then he looked at Natasha who was like whatever age she was 10 and I asked her name and that was it and I just thought that he's a man he's just an ignorant man. Yeah. And then I heard some other stuff over that weekend of how he'd spoken to a certain young woman in the marquee. Literally a girl of 16 maybe at the time was in tears at how he spoke to her.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1229s)

Really?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1230s)

Told her her top was too low and her skirt was too short and stuff like that. And I hope she...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1235s)

Turned around and said, what are you looking for?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1240s)

Yeah. Yeah. I remember her dad being really angry and everybody getting up against him and he was sort of nearly thrown out for it, you know, but also something else that happened that weekend, which sort of, yeah, just made me go, this is wrong. My sister and her husband have moved to a new house and it's quite difficult to be able to afford houses in Warren Point because it is a very scenic place. And they moved, they got permission from the local brethren to move about six miles away from actual Warren Point to a place called Hilltown.

 So they moved they had moved there they'd been there about a year they bought this house um and they'd spent about 50 grand on it to get it sort of further and eyes if you like and my brother also he had only been moved six weeks when Bruce Hales came and my brother [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1302s) he had no money he struggled the brethren all got together in Warren Point and helped him get that house every Saturday we went to that house to make it fit to live in and he was literally only in there six weeks with this big mortgage and he you know he's just a couple of years older than me so he was in his 40s and um anyway Bruce Hales came and it was felt that oh because we were thinking of having a subdivision in that little village if you like [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1333s) so Bruce Hales came and And so it was just like, oh, he'll pass it all. He'll say, oh yeah, it's fine. He drove past my sister's house. And their house is a bit, it was out in the country. It had about an acre of land or whatever. And next to it was a field of donkeys. Yeah, proper Irish donkeys. And in the next meeting, nobody knew that he'd been there, except Graham and Nicola, my sister in that day. In the next meeting, the whole meeting basically was about these donkeys. And he said, you lot are no better than those donkeys. In fact, yes. I think those donkeys have got more between those ears of theirs than you lot have.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1385s)

Wow. What year?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1388s)

Everybody thought this was funny at the time, because they didn't know what he was talking about. Yeah you know he was always just joking he's just joking you know. I looked at my sister across she's just sitting right across the room from me and she was absolutely in an absolute state crying so straight after the meeting I went to her and I said what on earth what's the matter with you she said oh haven't you heard and I said no what Mr. Hales says that we have to we have to move away from here we can't live here [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1421s) can't live in we can't live six miles away from one point we have to move back in and he made all these promises he talked to my and I remember Nicola saying to me I'm ready to run away. 

And um my brother actually was very angry because he had taken on a mortgage and he said I'm not I'm not doing it I'm not doing it he just kept saying I'm not doing it. Um he did eventually have to but not till after I left so a good five six years later but Bruce Hales then sort of promised my brother-in-law oh I'll pay the difference all this stuff and pointed out a road that they should live in and well he never paid the difference.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1468s)

No of course because you can't you know. What year would have this been do you remember?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1475s)

2010, August 2010\.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1478s)

Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1481s)

Yet there's no hierarchy in there.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1486s)

Yeah, yeah. So this was all in my head, you know, and the marriage was a mess. And then I could see my kids, you know, my older boys, you know, they were thinking of getting married. And I was like, is this going to be my life? Is this literally going to be my life? Yeah. And then the Charity Commission thing came up. And we were allowed to watch the BBC news and we saw, I remember her name now, Baroness, whatever her name is, who had a link to the brother. She stood up with her testimony. And we were sitting around this with my sister actually and her family and that around this little screen and um she goes oh they're such liars and I said but she's not lying that is what happened you know and I started going but that is what happened you know and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1545s) probably from 2010 I'd also I'd stopped reading my bible I'd stopped praying I'd just given up. I let him do what he wanted to do with me because I couldn't be bothered fighting him. But yeah. May 2012 again came to a bit of a head for me. I say I let him do whatever he wanted to me but this time I don't know exactly what happened. I just remember coming out of the ensuite and and saying something or something and then when he got in bed he tried to do something and I can't remember the details but I lost my speech. 

And I just remember lying staring at the ceiling not knowing what to do, what to say. I couldn't say anything. It was all in my head. There was just so much in my head that it just felt like it was going to explode. And he actually called my parents then and he thought that I was having having a stroke or something. Well they all did actually because I couldn't say anything I was just like in this trance and the ambulance came and took me to hospital and it wasn't until I eventually managed to get the message that I wanted pen and paper and I wish I could read that piece of paper now to what I actually wrote. But I just wrote, I never wrote about the Brethren because that was always such a secret, wasn't it?

 I just wrote, I wrote about my marriage, I wrote about money worries and yeah. And the hospital then sent me for self-esteem, to go on a self-esteem course. And I did go on that. And I think that is, again, what opened my eyes to this is wrong. So that was in 2012\. Yeah. Yeah, come January 2013 I just, I suppose yeah, I found myself contemplating life or death. Yeah. I had to make that choice. Yeah, I stood at the end of the pier in Warren Point and that's where I made that choice.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1701s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1703s)

But I had no idea, absolutely no idea how I was going to get out. I thought somebody would have to kidnap me or, and at that point, it sounds awful now, but at that point I was so desperate and so crazy. I was, I had written like almost like suicide letters to my children.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1724s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1726s)

But there were letters to say I was leaving, but I've no idea at that point when I wrote them what what I was doing. Um and then I just came to that I couldn't leave. I couldn't leave them. I could leave but not leave them. Yeah I didn't know how it was going to work out and I just decided okay I just have to tell them and it was the end of a Sunday in um the 27th of January 2013 and ah it was a terrible day because I knew what I was going to do I decided it was going to be that day and again I started bargaining with God I was like okay we'll go to the supper and if I come out of there alive and if everybody comes out alive I'll know it's okay I can keep going to the next step you know and I was sure that somebody was going to drop dead. 

And I knew all that was going on in my head and anyway I got through the supper then we went to Dublin and I didn't really talk to anybody I was scared to talk to anybody in case it came out I was scared to talk to my mum and so I didn't talk to anybody and then after we'd been out for dinner and we came home yeah I just said I said I'm not going I'm not going to the last meetings and he was like oh you know I [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1815s) I sort of told warned him I told him the marriage was over but I hadn't told him that I was leaving the brethren and I think I think that was the biggest shock for all of them because I sort of lived this life for so long and pretended and tried so hard um and yeah it it was heartbreaking to tell them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1838s)

I bet, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1842s)

How old were your kids at that point?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1848s)

Sorry my earphones were playing up. Um so uh my eldest was 24, 22, 20, uh 13 and 11\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1869s)

And were any married? So you had some pretty young ones. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1872s)

No, at this point they weren't married. So, no, so there was seven of us living at home. Yeah. So I told my eldest first. He was actually sort of engaged to a girl at that point. And my second son also was sort of engaged, although they hadn't had approval from Bruce at that point. So yeah, I told him, I said, look, this marriage is over, but not only that, I'm finished with the brethren and I've had enough. I mean, I felt like I was going crazy and maybe I was a bit crazy, but I think you almost have to get crazy.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1917s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1918s)

You know, you almost have to get to that crazy point.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1923s)

Yeah, you have to get to a breaking point before you can make that decision.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=1927s)

Yeah. And then, yeah, I mean, I just remember Clint was heartbroken. He just pleaded with me, said, I understand the marriage, but please not the brother. And there, that was strangely got my second who I was, we were like, friends almost more than mom and son. And he had actually tried to leave himself three times um but he was the one that was the most angry yeah he was so so angry. Yeah so after that announcement on the Sunday evening um it was agreed that I would talk to the priests on the Monday the priest happened to be my brother and my uncle because we're all basically related um but anyway I just spoke to my brother and he and he honestly was couldn't have been more understanding and empathetic wow and he just took me for a walk and we talked and and it made me think has he got died too you know what what you know he never he never preached to me or he just let me talk. 

Um and I obviously was pretty shocked by all that had happened, you know, all that Martin had done. And then three days later, priests, my uncle and him came and they said, Oh, would it help if Martin, that's my ex, moved out of the house? I think they thought that if they moved him out, then I would, you know, pine for him back or something. I don't know. Anyway, that was the best thing that could happened so he moved out and I was left with my five kids who were obviously still going to the meetings and everything but you know here with me I mean on the monday I went out and bought myself jeans I went and got my hair cut I went you know I was just I just went crazy into the world yeah I just from that point um and yeah so he moved out [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2061s) went and lived with my uncle for a bit it. And slowly each of my children left me then. Except I got custody off my youngest two until they were 16\. Rightly or wrongly, I don't know, but I made the decision not to stop them from going to the Brethren School or to stop them going to the meetings. I sort of felt that they might turn against me more if I did that. So yeah, I wasn't even, I wasn't shut up until the July, or confined as they called it. But yeah, they confined me in the July because I made the decision to go on holiday to Morocco, which was a godless country. I've got the emails, I've got the emails off my, off my sister saying the Lord won't go with you there. I was like, okay, so he what, he says goodbye to me at the bottom of the set? I'm going to Morocco but I ain't coming. I said, no, you know what I mean. I said, no, I don't know what you mean. Anyway, yeah, so when I went to get custody of Natasha and Oscar, the brethren actually drew up a parental agreement to try and get me to sign, which I refused. So I went through the courts and got custody of them. But like I say, they went to the meetings every night. So I was, yeah, I was shut up from then. And then, yeah, a bit of a bombshell hit me in April 2014, just over a year after I left. I got breast cancer. So you can only imagine.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2191s)

What they're thinking inside. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2195s)

Well and you're so programmed you take that with you.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2197s)

Sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah I sort of I remember saying to a friend of mine but two weeks before saying you know if I ever get cancer you know what they're gonna say but I got to that point where I knew that wasn't how things work.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2216s)

Yeah good for you.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2217s)

But I still had the fear of being judged.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2222s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2223s)

I hated that. I feared that. I feared their reaction and how much they were probably going to pressurize me more almost than the cancer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2234s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2235s)

I was just like, and yeah, it was, it did play out exactly that way. You know, they then, oh, they were all over me and, you know, oh, I could go into my dad mom's house at any time and you know mom would never come to my house but I could go to theirs and you know people would come around with meals and you know they were there all the time and yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2261s)

Wow so they took it as a chance to try and bribe you to come back?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2266s)

Yes absolutely and because I was vulnerable.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2271s)

Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2276s)

My dad said to me, I'm not saying God's punishing you, but what?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2283s)

But read my lips.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2287s)

For a group that doesn't judge, they sure judge.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2291s)

Yeah. You know, you can just hear them all in the meeting going, oh, this is what happened to her, you know, this story. Yeah. hey I lived yeah I didn't die from it but even then even then they had an answer. The only reason I lived was because they were praying for me. Oh my of course of course. Oh the other reason was because I was still on the uh the brethren's um health insurance policy. So I you know if I hadn't had that I probably wouldn't have lived either because I've got private private health. Wow wow so yeah um.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2338s)

So are all your children in the PBCC now?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2343s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2344s)

Wow. So what happened to your ex then? Did he stay in Ireland?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2351s)

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah um so he confessed everything actually. Wow. He admitted to everything that he'd done, but he wasn't, yeah, he wasn't shut up or anything. He was, he's fine. Yeah. I mean, he's not fine. He's apparently an alcoholic from what I understand, but yeah. They all are. 

But yes, he has his children there. Yeah. Yeah, so Natasha turned 16 in January 2016\. And on St Patrick's Day of March 16th, they asked if they could go out with a brother and family for the day and I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, don't want to spoil their fun. And I said, as long as you're back for nine o 'clock because it was school the next day. And they didn't come home. And they weren't answering their phones. And eventually I got an email to my ex and he rang me and he said, they're not coming home. And I said, hang on a minute. Oscar's only 15, you know. Yeah. And you know, I said, get them here straight away. And he said, No, Natasha’s just 16\. She doesn't, she need to come. It's her choice. 

And I said, well, you've got to get Oscar here now. And they did bring up, he did bring Oscar back. But yeah, Natasha, my daughter, never really saw her again properly after that. She came to pick up her clothes three days later and we cried and hugged each other. And because she got really close to me at one point, she had stopped going to meetings and stuff then they got in her head. Um yeah and she said to me I'll never stop contact with your mom but it was only six weeks is all it took. Yeah wow. So my youngest then he lived with me for a little bit then and then he was heartbroken because we'd become this little family unit and now he didn't have Natasha and I had had to get a full-time job and he was spending a lot of time at brethren's houses after school and that sort of thing so my brother-in-law said [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2497s) could he come and live with us and you can have access to him so I agreed to that and I did in fairness I did have full access to him um but he would never come back in the house, we would go down and have ice cream or have a takeaway or something like that. And then at the end of 2016, he phoned me with his GCSE results and I took a card and some money to him and then he just never answered his phone after that and he never has um well they all changed their phone numbers but like I say I have managed to get off his phone number very recently [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2549s) I've sent him some messages that he reads but yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2551s)

Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2555s)

This is the part this is the part of the whole empire that needs to be taken away, the way they split up families, like this is heart-wrenching, heart-wrenching Anne, like it's just, it's not right, it's just not right. It's just... No, it's just like... It's so inhumane. It's so inhumane to take a mother away from her children.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2581s)

Yeah. No 16-year-old child should have to make that choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2588s)

No. No. And you know, we've all been there. We know, we know how they sit with them. We know how they get in their head. I mean, I had my cousins living with, with, with us when things were separated. Like, I, I know what they say. You know how they sit there and get inside your head.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2605s)

Yeah. That is just a... She wrote me a letter. She wrote me a letter in 2017\. And it's just full of contradictions. Yeah. You know, she wants, she needs her mother. She wants her mom. Mom, you know me best. Mom, I love you. But, you know, all this other stuff.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2625s)

Yeah. Well, and it tears, it tears up a family for the, for the rest of time. Because I know my mom is 30 years later from when my sister jumped out the upstairs bedroom window and left, ran away from her. And 30 years later, she still has those moments where she just sits down and cries. Yeah. because nothing fixes it 30 years later it's still just as raw.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2653s)

You know yeah but my grandchildren why why should you know I'll tell you about actually so in in um so I ended up actually living in in UK because um in 2018 things got really bad just because it was small town and I'm you know my children were starting to have children and I was seeing them and I remember Natasha running away from me in a shop when she saw me and that sort of thing and anyway I put something on Facebook and the ex-brethren community in New Zealand came forward and said get in the plane and get to New Zealand. So in 2018, 2019, I spent in New Zealand. And while I was there, I met Dan, my partner, who's from here, who's from Cheshire in UK.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2713s)

It's a small world.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2714s)

Yeah. And so that's how I ended up. But it's easier to be geographically further away from them. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm not seeing them, it's not so hard. It is hard. But yeah. So, oh yeah, so I was going to tell you a story about in 21, I sold my house back home, so we had to go over there to just finalise everything. And I hummed and had about going to any of my children's front doors. Anyway, I decided I would go to my eldest, Clint. Because he had sort of would have answered my emails or messages up until I went to New Zealand. Anyway, we decided we'd go. So me and Dan walked up the drive and there was this little boy at the window. And that's the best of her grandson. Wow. And you could see him saying, there's somebody at the door. Yeah. And then he just disappeared. And we knocked again. Nothing. Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2796s)

It's cruel. Absolutely cruel.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2799s)

I know they've got another child, but I don't know how many grandchildren I've got. I've no idea. Wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2809s)

I just don't know how they can reconcile that with Christianity you know there's just there's just no reconciling that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2816s)

It's just those wasted years as well you know yeah. Yeah how can you can you ever make that time off.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2825s)

Yeah yeah you don't and you know one time my parents tried getting to know like my kids and it just it's just so hard it's so hard it's stressed out my daughter so bad because all she wanted was a parent set of grandparents that could be there in her life 100 but they couldn't give that right and they the kids aren't dumb like they they feel that it's just the coming from both ends listening to your story and then going through kind of what [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2855s) tried to do with with my family at one point it's just this is the part of the system that that we have to find a way how to stop.

I don't know how to do that I don't know if it's course of control um a law that governs groups um I don't know what it is but I know that we've got to kind of all put our heads together and find a way to this is the part this is the biggest part that has to be stopped and I'm you know Bruce Hales is going to be like oh well every family [gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2885s) to make their own choices their choice yeah yeah yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2888s)

It is not true rubbish yeah it's not true. No it's not anybody says oh it's a personal decision no it's not read Natasha's letter I have to keep myself pure that's not a daughter talking about her mom no yeah sorry I agree. I mean, I have been talking to my local MP about coercive control. Because it's a criminal offence within a domestic setting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2921s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2923s)

The Family Survival Trust are looking at, that they're trying, they're meant to be having a meeting with the Home Secretary. I've actually got a meeting, a Zoom meeting with the Family survival trust tomorrow um but but yeah my mp is sort of like well there's not much we can do in this situation because it's a freedom of religion.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2947s)

Yeah I see that it's not a...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2949s)

Religion that's that's the part that they don't get it's not a religion you don't go to church because it's not church you go to this setting where you submit yourself to being yelled at for hours at a time you know like like the meeting that you went to where he discussed the donkeys there's nothing biblical about a bunch of donkeys he was he was using a church setting to berate people to run them down and to mock them and that's not what church is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2977s)

No.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2978s)

There's nothing about that that is church.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2981s)

No and that's again why they shouldn't be getting charity status.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=2985s)

No they should not have charity status not at all no no and I mean you know now you think it's funny we're I mean it's not funny but it's funny we're all creating our own charities to recover from their charity right like it's just this is just ridiculous right it's yeah and the thing is is going back to what you were saying about like the amount of lies just the lies that they tell you know like that explanation you're saying about when she was watching somebody [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3015s) testimony and she was saying their lies she was lying that is their biggest comeback on everything everything is like even when I talked to my oldest sister this spring is she really reiterated that Cheryl you everything you 99.9 of the stuff you're going to hear is lies but they don't realize that how many lies they live and how many lies they tell they lie so much that they now believe their own lies to be true.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3043s)

Yeah well I mean I mean he said tell your mind what to think and it you know you're not thinking the lies are just you're just telling them that it's true.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3054s)

Yeah exactly let's go to I just want to jump to something that we talked about earlier and when we're talking about lies um in in in in regards to um people taking their own lives like that has to be the biggest lie that you can tell someone can you can you tell us that story that you were telling us earlier?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3079s)

Yeah well I can tell you about the two but um the more recent one in Dublin which was two years ago. And although it was known amongst the local brethren that it was suicide they were told by Bruce Hales not to talk about how she died but just to say the Lord had taken her. But then there was also a case back in, I would say it was 2003 in Ireland again where a woman committed suicide and we were told that there shouldn't be any stigma attached to her death because the Lord took her. But he also said, Bruce Hales said that, but he, Bruce has also said she would have had regrets at the last minute. So yeah, I don't know how that ties up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3140s)

Is, do you see what I mean? Like the biggest lie that you can, you can tell is like literally a lie about how someone passed away like that's just that's just so immorally wrong. Why do they why does he feel the need to lie about that?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3157s)

Right yeah what does he have to cover? Because he's scared because he's scared because it reflects the horror and the sadness that everybody goes through living inside his system. Um if if it wasn't like that why would you cover it up and first of all to say someone and the Lord took him and then to go back and say it would have been their biggest regret at the end he's not God he does not have access to know how they would have felt at the end and that's not right for him to to pass judgment like that [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3189s) horrifying that a leader of a supposed church could make a statement like that who does he think he is yeah yeah exactly that's between that person and they're God. He doesn't enter into that equation at all.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3206s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think that's my biggest fear or wit that I carry a bit with me is, if that's the way he looks on suicide, it almost makes it okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And, you know, God forbid that I ever hear of one of my siblings or my children, but that's my biggest fear. Yeah. That they find themselves in the position I was in, but they think that choosing death is okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3245s)

And he's really opened up that belief in there. Like he's really starting to teach that that it is better to take your love and go to heaven than leave and go to hell like who teaches that to a congregation right like that's just...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3263s)

Yes even my dad said when when the other the other guy that died in 2015 um and I I sent an email to my dad about it and he said well at least he never left the brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3279s)

See it's just that's just wrong that's just wrong there has to be a way the government when like I don't know how a government would hear these kinds of stories and sit back after the history that we've had on the planet right with the history that we know of that's happened in these situations and sit back and be like oh we're not going to touch this group.

 I just it's just I think people have got to get rid of their fear that we have out here they're they're bark is [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3309s) worse in their bite seriously yeah it's just we have to start having these conversations and realizing the more we have these conversations that it dissipates this fear of like oh my goodness what is what are they going to do to us they're not going to do anything to us if there's a there's such power in numbers people ask...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3327s)

Me you know yeah people ask me oh am I am I not scared you know writing the book no I'm not scared of them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3334s)

Me either.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3335s)

No.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3336s)

Not I'm not.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3337s)

scared of them there's nothing scary about calling outright blasphemy outright blasphemy yeah I mean it is what it is to say the things that he's saying are outright blasphemy there's no other word for it no because the man is not god he he cannot pronounce whether someone has regrets at the last minute that is just shocking. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3361s)

Yeah yeah yeah I like I do I really appreciate you coming on and telling your heart-wrenching story um it's stories like yours that need to be told um is as hard as it is it's super important for people to sit down like we're doing face to face and have people watch you and witness you telling your story of having to let all five of your children go it's I really believe the more that we continue doing this it will fall it's going to tumble in there but it still it takes work it takes all of us coming together it really takes us all coming together there's such power in numbers when [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3407s) go up absolutely yeah right I've been trying to tell this with the teachers at the school right now and they're being bound to NDAs. 

I just don't believe that those have power when you all move together. You don't. It's just pieces of paper. When there's such immorally wrong things that are happening, when you gather hundreds and hundreds of people together and move forward against it, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3438s) NDAs hold nothing. These things hold no merit up against hundreds of people coming at with asking and we're all doing it out of compassion every single one of us is doing it from our own trauma from our own wounds and when you come from that when you come from that place we want we want that justice we want balance we need balance in this equation.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3459s)

And I think it's super significant the number of women that are coming out and saying no more sit down no more shut up. Um and I think probably they're I think it hurts them worse when it's coming from women because they thought they had us they thought they had us sitting down and it ain't gonna happen because there is a story and that story is needed it's needed to get out for years.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3486s)

Yeah I mean when I left as a married woman it was pretty rare and yet there's been quite a few in the last 10 years in this country alone I don't know about with you but yeah.

And I think there's a lot in there that I think there's a lot in there that can look at your story and say wow it can be done and you can have a happily ever after.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3510s)

Yeah exactly yes. Yeah. Yeah I remember my therapist saying that to me about my children. Yeah I have felt guilt for so long but she said you're actually showing them love you didn't take your life you decided to live you're showing them love in what you're doing because you're being true to yourself you're being true to them you're doing exactly what you said you were going to do they can trust you and you're a beacon of light to them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3541s)

Yeah absolutely. You you've created a path you created a path for them to find their way out they have a landing pad on the other side and all you can yeah I didn't have... no exactly I didn't either like it's and I do I think it's important when when you when you're doing what you're doing we were talking with Peter Hart too and the same thing as I said to him I'm like you've got this landing pad at any moment those children can can see the blasphemy and the crap that's going on in there and they know they can just turn around and dad's got them.

In your case they could turn around they know mom's got them yeah right yeah and as hard as it is to hold steadfast [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3580s) that landing pad and to create your own life inside that heartache it's you're such a beautiful person to you're just so heartwarming and heart-centered that what child you know like they've got this beautiful heart centered landing pad to be able to turn at any point that they see that this is all rubbish which at one point they will yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3604s)

Yeah yeah I mean yeah I I'll read you a message you know you say about you know my kids love me my kids love me and and I know they still love me you know whatever but I'll just read this message that was so yeah Heidi Allen that left um she actually had contact was my youngest while she was in the brethren and um it just so [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3634s) that my youngest was quite keen on her daughter so Heidi was a bit of a go-between but she didn't when I when she left and we connected on Facebook she had no idea who I was because I've taken back my maiden name as well, anyway, she sent me a message that Oscar sent to her about me. 

This is about 18 months ago that he sent this message to her. I think the hardest part for me was I am the baby and she has always been my best friend. And I am a softie. So even when she was confined and I was still living with her, she would come and sleep in my bed for comfort. She had cancer during that time. So it was hard I love her and I know she loves me but it's just torn as I didn't want to leave her but I couldn't leave with her being against Mr Hales.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3689s)

See yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3699s)

Yeah we just yeah we just have to find a way to um keep opening up these doors. We really do.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3707s)

Nothing in that you know there's nothing in that about the bible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3710s)

No. It's pure love. Pure love between a mother and a child. And you can't break that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3716s)

Yeah it's just torn as I didn't want to leave her but I couldn't leave with her being against Mr Hales. Yeah but my book is called Porn.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3727s)

Oh I'm so looking forward to it coming out.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3732s)

Beautiful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3732s)

When are you expecting it to come out?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3738s)

Well because Rebecca's like been mentoring me and she's been out yeah amazing so she's doing like a final edit on it at the minute and um I haven't seen that yet but we're hoping by my 10 year anniversary which is the 20th of January um that we will approach publishers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3758s)

That's awesome.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3759s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3760s)

That's so if we go the if we go the publisher route it's quite slow. Yeah. Yeah so I don't know the timescale if I was to self-publish I you know I could have a night but she's very keen to go the publisher route. She knows publishers, she knows it and she knows. Yeah. Yeah. I just ordered her book. It just came in the mail the other day and I'm really excited to sit down and read it. Yeah. She's actually in the process of writing a film script for her book. Good for her. I mean, I know she won a Costa for that book, but she she's written seven other books. 

Oh, I didn't know that. 

Oh yeah, yeah, she's an author. She's a professor in literature. 

Oh, good to her. Wow.

 So her mentoring me is not just somebody that's written a book about the brethren and mentoring me. She's the real girl. She's the real girl, yeah. 

Wow, wow, that's so incredible. 

Yeah, she just released a book in the summer actually called Dark Earth. Yeah, Yeah. So she writes like historical novels. Oh, those are the best. I love historical novels. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Amazing books to read. Yeah. So yeah, she knows the right people to approach and she knows. Yeah. So she'll know. So I'm sort of leaving it in her hands in that sense. Yeah. I've told her on the edit just do you know just don't hold back just edit it. Yeah she's got the coercive control side way up front at the beginning of the book because she thinks that'll be a real hook at this point in time um and it's where she talks about when I discover that my daughter has got married. Well, I find out on the day she's getting married that she's getting married.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3887s)

Wow, that's sad.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3890s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3890s)

If you could, if your kids watch this, what would you want to say? What would you want to say to them?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3905s)

Um I just want to say that there is a life out here there is a life it's not all that evil that we've been taught. Yeah. I have got a good life you can have a good life and don't ever ever think that you haven't got a choice. I was told I didn't have a choice. You do have a choice. You do. And choose life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3937s)

Powerful words. Power, powerful, powerful words.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3940s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3942s)

What do you think is the downfall of the PBCC? What exactly do you mean by that? Like what do you think is what makes them as bad as what they are?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3961s)

I think it's actually evil men have power, money, sex, all leads to corruption. Yeah. It's corrupt. It's corrupt. I'm not saying it was right. I don't know if it was the whole thing was set off on a right thing. I don't know. It was never evangelical, was it? Back even in Derby's time. They never wanted to keep, you know, it was. Anyway. Women have been suppressed the whole time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=3996s)

Like the suppression of women has always been there. Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4000s)

Yeah. And that's wrong. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, imagine asking a museum to cover up stuff about women's rights.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4007s)

Yeah, let's go there, right? Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4011s)

Yep. And yet, at the end of the day, you can understand why they do it. Because by suppressing women, right there, they've suppressed half of the people in the flock. Yeah. You know, and in order to get control, in order to remain a power scheme, you have to get control over the whole flock. Women is the number one target because that shoots down half the flock.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4033s)

I used to ask myself the question is Bruce Hales also a victim of being brainwashed and conditioned but no, no, he knows what he made.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4045s)

Yeah he completely knows what he is doing he knows what he's doing why he drinks as heavy as he does is because that's how he has to suppress everything that's inside him he knows.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4056s)

Yeah. He had a plan back when he was in his late teens, and I guarantee you he carried it out to a T.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4066s)

Yeah. Like, I would think it became more of a cult in JT Jr. in the late 50s, when the whole separation thing came in. I don't know if JT Jr. actually had a plan, but because he was such an alcoholic, I'm not sure that he had a plan actually, but... Right. That's when it became more cult-like isn't it? Yeah. I mean separation, I mean I just think of my mum's family in that, at that time.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4094s)

Yeah. Because you had...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4095s)

To ask to break bread didn't you? Yeah. My mum's one of eight children, well two of her brothers were sort of late teens, 18, 19 maybe, at that time. And they had never asked to break bread and they didn't want to break bread. And my grandmother actually just put them out of the house. You know, why can't that be right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4119s)

Yeah. Almost like she came from Maple Creek, right, Cheryl?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4123s)

Yeah, right. You know, and I think, like, I do think Bruce has had many, many, many years to plot how he's going to do this, right? He's had so many years to figure out how to do it what to do it where do where to gain the control where to make the women more submissive and don't realize that they're being more submissive right like...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4147s)

Yeah what he did he's always had the he's always had the ability to make money which he can turn around and buy the extra control that he can't get by manipulation.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4157s)

Yeah and he just knows how to schmooze the women in there like my mom was just so steadfast on always relaying to me of how much more freedom they have in there and how much the things that oh yeah just understand blah blah blah but they have like they just have no concept of what he's built on the outside of it right like he's just made the jail 10 times harder to get out of.

 I just think people need to realize that fear if you can recognize what your fear is and then ask your fear like face your fears like I mean I know that's very cliche statement but it is so empowering when you take the fear that we all grew up in and place it on a platter in [front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4208s) of you and actually look at it and stare at it long enough to realize that you are always stronger than the fear that was that was in enmeshed in you, you are stronger than the fear of no money you are stronger than the fear of not having a place to live you are stronger than the fear of not knowing well when I leave the world's gonna gobble me up like you are stronger than all those, you were made in the image of God.

Sit down and sit with that for a minute you were [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4238s) in the made in the image of Bruce Hales you were made in the image of God no yeah right so that blessing that essence sits inside you you just have to access it and when you access it the fear just starts dissipating away and all of a sudden you rise up to the surface with truth that's what everybody inside there needs to do is remember that through all of this what comes out of Bruce Hales's mouth is not truth.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4270s)

Yeah I mean yeah I mean to listen to him talking the other day oh I mean you you did that you know my frustration at how they can't see. Yeah yeah it's yeah that's uh...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4288s)

Or the hypocrisy the hypocrisy between he's having all these meetings yet there's articles being made prints people things being put in print that there's no hierarchy that the brethren don't meddle in with their businesses there's no there's no crossover between the church and their businesses all of these lies after lies after lies after lies yet they're saying we are the ones that are lying when they have it in black and white. 

Literally the complete and utter hypocrisy of what he is saying and what it's imprinted that they say.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4322s)

I remember, I remember back in, probably was about 2010 or something like that. I don't know when it was. Anyway, my brother went to some meetings in Barbados or somewhere with him. And I remember when he came out, he said I mean he was Leonard my brother was saying this in a good way but he said it was difficult to know whether you were in a meeting or in a business meeting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4349s)

Yeah right.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4350s)

Yeah yeah he even used the foyer for the business seminars yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4358s)

And you know there's red flags everywhere.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4361s)

Yeah they're frantically investigating inside they're of you know who leaked strive 23 right like it's just a frantic witch hunt happening and instead like you shouldn't have to worry about these things right like if you are a mainstream christian church you shouldn't have to worry about that right you just those Bruce those shouldn't be things that you worry about right you have nothing to hide.

 I shouldn't be why are you still been right yeah so anyhow you can't get my information on my laptop I took it in yesterday and it's all just protected up to the ninth to every level possible so this time you don't get it. I learned my lesson once I don't need to learn it a second time.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4410s)

I'm gonna do that again. Yeah. But yeah I after that happened to you I went and got a hard drive I back everything off but yeah sometimes when me and Rebecca have a are having a zoom something goes a bit funny or and we're always like oh they're outside.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4434s)

Yeah oh it's yeah I do I really do think that this is all gonna it's gonna all come out it's just we have to stay consistent right consistency being persistent um letting our fear of what we think they're gonna do roll away because it's not it's not real it's complete illusion yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4456s)

Unless you do things like like Lance has done things where he sort of gone to people's doors and told them that it's a lie so that's invading the privacy of people isn't it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4470s)

Yeah I definitely wouldn't do that I would do protesting right I would definitely do protests and I mean obviously I got some in the works. I don't have an issue with protests. I yeah I definitely wouldn't go and knock on people's doors. I might Bruce Hales but I wouldn't to the everyday people inside inside there. No I wouldn't do that. No.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4491s)

Yeah. No. You know that's only asking for trouble.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4496s)

But there is a way to do this. 100% there is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4499s)

And we can do it. We can do it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4502s)

Yeah yeah yeah we can do it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4505s)

And we will do it no longer sit down and shut up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4508s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4509s)

Yeah exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4511s)

Is there anything else that you want to add in that you didn't cover that you wanted to cover?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4516s)

No. No I don't think so I sort of feel like my story's not like it was with everybody's story is different isn't it. You know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4525s)

You can't compare. Yeah don't compare that's always my biggest thing that I get in my emails. My story is not like yours. And I said, you know what? We have to get past not comparing our stories and realize that just the separation alone puts us all in the same field of trauma. We all go through the same grief. We all go through the same heartache. We all go through the exact same puddle of muck. Everybody does. We're all in here [together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4557s) It just inserts story and truth here. It's all the same. Yeah it really is all the same and I from the bottom of my heart just reiterate that over and over and over to people that I if if you could leave that part out of the emails that you send me because we're all on the same we're all on the same yeah there's no difference.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4578s)

No I mean it is yeah to personal a person on the outside any of our stories is just yeah having to leave everything behind is is bad enough isn't it exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MBeQ38dMWw&t=4593s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
