In the brethren's view of the universe, God sits at the top of the pyramid, followed so closely by the man of God, Bruce D. Hales, that to make any distinction between the two is regarded as an act of treason. Then come the royal family, Bruce's four sons, Gareth, Dean, Greg, and Charles. Below them come the so-called Levites, arrogant and ruthless businessmen such as Rod Diplock and Mick Strange, whom Bruce makes wealthy and who in return loyally [defend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=33s) his interests. Below them come the males of the common herd of the brethren, and below them the females, all those work hard to enrich the man of God and the royal family. The males get paid for their work; married females volunteer. These five upper layers of the hierarchy of the universe are all that are to be saved. Everything outside of this tiny elite who call themselves the saints constitutes the world, a system controlled by satan, but which is [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=63s) there for the brethren to plunder and exploit. The inhabitants of the world, called worldlies behind their backs and non-community members to their faces, are likewise there to be exploited and discarded once their usefulness ends. These persons are neither loved or hated; they are mere servants beneath the dignity of the saints to discuss or consider.

There are however, two classes of humanity below these, and in these the brethren take a great interest. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=94s) opposers are regarded with fear and hatred. Prayers are publicly made in the brethren's gospel halls for their death and removal. Any saint caught in the act of communicating with an opposer is immediately excommunicated. Opposers are blamed and made scapegoats for every misfortune that besets the church. Opposers are kept under constant surveillance by private investigators and any opportunity to intimidate or litigate them into silence is seized upon and pursued to the bitter end with no regard to either expense [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=124s) morality. The Brethren have so much to hide that opposers who are willing to spill the beans publicly on their crimes are an existential threat. Those mutual beneficial links with corrupt cabinet ministers, the wholesale money laundering and tax evasion, the rampant sexual abuse, all these pleasures and privileges of the Brethren elite are threatened by the persistent little voices that from time to time catch the attention of both journalists and departments of government to the detriment of the cult. [Richard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=155s) Marsh has been one of those little voices for many years. His persistence has cost the Brethren both large amounts of revenue and the respect of many influential persons. From 2015, when Richard first started publishing, to this day, the Brethren have pursued him with an endless stream of harassment. This episode exposes in detail just two or three months of Richard's experiences at the hands of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. The four quotes below from the published ministry of Man of God, Bruce D. Hales, are [examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=185s) of the virulent hate speech against opposers that comes constantly from the very top of the Exclusive Brethren Church.

### [**PBCC**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=193s)

The media is a forum to attack, attack persons, attack groups, attack individuals. The devil's got hold of it.

Not so easy to grapple with it, is it? The media is a masterstroke of the enemy to corrupt man's minds. You see, the current attack really involves persons in high places, being poisoned against the saints' by opposers.

Persons that have become apostate, opposing the brethren. It's a very serious matter.

 Of course,it would be rare that persons will go out from amongst us and get into that position. But there are others that would attack the position, fooled really by Satan against what's true.

Some lose their way. That's one matter. Others that come back as opposed to, against the position, that's a very serious matter. God will deal with these persons in due time.

Persons that attack the truth in a very bold way. They don't get recovered. Recovery is not open to them. God has finished with them.

There's no common ground with persons that don't believe in God. Get the best legal guns you can hire and just keep shooting until there's not one of them remaining.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=283s)

Brethren's surveillance and harassment of leavers and especially opposers commenced in the 1960s but has become greatly intensified under the paranoid hand of Bruce D. Hales. This bitter campaign continues to this day against hundreds of former members of the cult all around the globe. We could mention Laurie Moffat, Peter Harrison, Dr. Ian McKay, Lance Christie, Dr. Jill Mytton, Dick Wyman, Tim [Twinam,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=313s) and Braden Simmons, amongst many others, as past and present victims of this senseless hatred.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=328s)

From the day Richard Marsh left the Brethren in 2015, he was relentlessly pursued and harassed. His emails and social media were hacked. His private messages were stolen and shared. He was arrested by the police on trumped-up charges. He and his wife were followed everywhere by private investigators, both legal and otherwise. Elite lawyers and barristers in the UK, the USA and Canada were hired to trip him up by any means possible. False witnesses were paid to sign fictitious [affidavits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=358s) which were filed with the courts and a plot to forcibly detain him and steal his computer was only foiled by a last-minute change of heart by the man commissioned to do the job. That man was David Wallace.

In early 2021, Wallace handed over to Richard the entire archive of emails, text messages, and recorded phone calls between himself and the senior PBCC leaders who were directing him in the hunt. These communications give an extraordinary window into the ruthless and malicious minds of the leaders of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Their utter disregard of the law, justice, compassion, or humanity. Today, we release for the first time a selection of these communications between Hired [Gun,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=401s) David Wallace, Top Lawyer, Gerald Chipeur QC, and Plymouth Brethren Christian Church leaders Brad Mitchell, Rod Diplock, Mick Strange, and Keith Prince. First of all, we must introduce you to these key players in the Brethren's Criminal Game.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=417s)

Gerald Chipeur is a Top Lawyer and KC with Miller Thompson, based in Calgary, Alberta. He was counsel for the Conservative Party of Canada and counsel for the PBCC. He is a veteran anti-gay rights campaigner and a prominent member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He was also a close friend of former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and both the lawyer and business partner of Pierre Poilievre, who will likely be [Canada's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=447s) next Prime Minister. Chipeur has worked with prominent North American brethren such as Chuck Truan and Brad Mitchell to harass and suppress critics of the Brethren for over 20 years.

Brad Mitchell is a manager in the UBT, the Universal Business Team, which is the financial wing of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. He's the president of Klondike Lubricants, a 100-employee business in British Columbia. He's the leading elder of the Vancouver congregation of the PBCC and he's president of a PBCC charitable trust with assets of over $15 million. He has recently been made the Canadian CEO of Ox Group [International,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=493s) a global tool business founded and run by Dean Hales, PBCC leader Bruce Hales' second son. He is also a manager in AncoShield, which is a PPE profiteering business also founded and run by Dean Hales.

Rod Diplock from San Francisco is the CEO of ControlTech, which is a cash handling and security business. He's also one of the four USA directors of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. He's a director of the Universal Business Team and he's a director of Shavano Consulting which is Dean Hales' property investment company.

This slide is the corporate page for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church showing the directors and the directors are Jeff Southard, Matt Locke, Mick Strange and Rod Diplock.

Mick Strange is the CEO of All Fasteners USA, which is the American branch of All Fasteners, a business owned by Greg Hales, one of Bruce Hales' sons. Previously Mick was a director at UBT accountants. Mick is also one of the four directors of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in the USA.

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get A Life Podcast. I am Cheryl, an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church as are known now, from Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. And today with me on the panel is Richard Marsh, who is also an ex-member. So welcome, Richard. We have a doozy of a show today with our very special guest, David Wallace. Welcome, David, and thank you so much for joining us today.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=644s)

Pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=646s)

For those of you who don't know who David Wallace is, he is the political fixer that was hired by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church to hunt down Richard Marsh. And we are going to take you right to the beginning of this entire evil plot and we're going to walk you through it. I know that there's a lot of insiders in there that have never heard this story and have just been asking for us to do a podcast on this so that they can get the whole story, what happened. So I'm going to try and find words instead of tears to this insidious ordeal [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=677s) to the insiders listening and watching this, buckle up. So let's start at the beginning of this, David. So how did this all start? Who reached out to you first, I guess, would be my biggest question.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=691s)

Well, I was uh in Alberta, um Canada at the time doing a variety of different jobs for a gentleman who's extremely uh politically connected in Alberta. His name is Alan Hallman. He was the um, I guess for lack of a better word, the fixer for Premier Jason Kenny and prior to Kenny, Ralph Klein for many, many years. Alan had hired me on a variety of different jobs while I was in Alberta. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=722s) had started hiring me um after I'd already been in Alberta on the Naheed Nenshi job which has seen plenty of newspaper coverage, the former mayor of Calgary, now current leader of the NDP in Alberta. I had been hired by a group of individuals who I can't name due to legal handcuffs, so to speak, had hired me to get rid of the mayor or at least set up a scenario where the mayor would be compromised. When that sort of came apart, I was about to depart Alberta and Mr. Hallman, filled the gap with a lot of very lucrative employment.

In late 2020, he reached out to me with the name of a lawyer named Gerald Chipeur, who I had heard before.

He said that his friend Gerry was being engaged by a community, didn't tell me what type of community, and that they were looking for an individual who was a fraudster and had outstanding warrants for his arrest and they were having trouble locating him. This was again late 2020\. They sent me a file, I read it over briefly and I accepted the job.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=795s)

Perhaps if we stop there just for a moment, we can pull up some of these documents, some of the receipts that relate to what you're saying at this point in the story, Cheryl. Okay, so explain what we're seeing here. Yeah, so to take kind of one step back, just to set the scene as it was, you know, from the Brethren's perspective.

So immediately before they hired David Wallace, David Wallace was hired at the very end of 2020\. And so this is an email from the middle of 2020\. This is before David and the Brethren had collided. At this point, the Brethren were searching for me and they had hired a different private investigator. They had hired an investigator called Stuart Morse of Pro-West Investigation and Protection, Inc. in Calgary.

And Stuart Morse was, you know, he wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. And he was trying to find me, and he contacted my friend, Dr. Kirat Singh. And we had kind of caught Morse in a sting operation because we set up an email account pretending to be a hacker offering hacking services, offered to Morse to provide, offered to Morse to [hack,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=877s) you know, Marsh's emails. And Stuart Morse, on behalf of his client, who we now know is the Brethren, took the bait. So this is an email from Stuart Morse to XCypher, which is kind of the pseudonym for this hacker who wasn't really a hacker.

And this is what Stuart Morse is saying. So this is sort of six months before this all goes down. This is the brethren's previous attempt to find me. So Stuart Morse says;

 "Hi, I apologize for the delay as I've been in negotiations with my client on your behalf. And at the same time being respectful of the client's scepticism over the cost of something that may not meet the objective. In saying that, the client is not concerned about your monitoring [skills,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=928s) more so regarding whether or not you can lead the client to Mr Marsh. Obviously, I'm not at liberty to identify my client. Am I correct to believe that the client is concerned about any criminal activity that Mr Marsh may be involved in as it speaks to his instability?

How confident are you that Marsh can be located using your skills? And if so, do you recommend monitoring his phone or email account to meet the objective? If he is outside the UK, it is doubtful that he would be using his UK mobile.

And if so, would you be able to identify his location? I'm assuming you will be able to provide his billing address and monitor incoming outgoing calls and their location within the UK. With regards to Kenesha, (that's my wife) are you suggesting that she is currently living in Canada as she is originally from Jamaica and may have returned as a result of the pandemic? Are you able to determine her whereabouts? I appreciate your patience and understanding and look forward to your [response,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=994s) which will be instrumental in moving forward, regards Stu Morse, Pro-West investigation." 

So this is very important to grasp this. David Wallace was not the first guy hired by the brethren to look for me. In fact there were several private investigators hired before Stuart Morse. Um so, um this was so for a [period](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1024s) of maybe two or three months, um Dr. Singh and I fed Stuart Morse emails, actually genuine emails from my email account, but ones that gave the impression I was in the UK. It was that the plan was to kind of leave the brethren off the track so they were looking in the wrong continent to find me. And at some point late in, I would say end of August in 2020, Stuart Morse realized he was being led up [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1054s) garden path and suddenly he wasn't buying any more emails and at that point, um you know, that's kind of a silence fell over the scene and we were wondering, well, okay, they realized that Morse is, you know, incompetent and, you know, what are they going to do next?   
Um okay, so this is what happened next. And this is the moment that David has just been speaking about. So this is an email from Gerald Chipeur who's a, who was a QC, now a KC, I suppose, a top lawyer, top accredited lawyer with Miller Thompson. And he's a guy, he was the general counsel to the Conservative Party in Canada, and he was also the lawyer for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in Canada. Heavily involved in anti-gay rights activity, heavily involved in the campaign to try and prevent gay marriage being legalized, also heavily involved in [suppressing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1114s) previous websites like peebs.net that were publishing allegations about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

So this was the first document that shows Gerald Chipeur hiring David Wallace on behalf of the Brethren, his clients,to  hunt me down. And this is an email that has a whole bunch of attachments. And it says, "This is the first of 10 pages, because the first page of these attachments is attached to this email." And it says, "We require a skip trace on Richard Marsh. We will also require an affidavit, Gerald D. Chipeur, QC, partner Miller Thompson, LLP, Calgary, Alberta." Now, to explain what was happening here, when David was [initially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1164s) hired, he wasn't hired

exactly to find me. He was hired to provide a skip trace report and which is, you know, uh like a private investigator's report as to where someone is, and also to provide affidavits. Um now what what happened was rather than getting David to do his own or pay David to do his own investigation at this point or do his own research to write affidavits, they sent to David [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1198s) pages out of a report prepared by Stuart Morse, by ProWest Investigations, which had been prepared by Stuart Morse over the previous year. And if we go on to the next slide, we will see some of those pages which were attached to this email. Now, the numbering of the pages shows that this report had at least 68 pages. So this is just a small section of it. So this is the first page of the of Stuart Morse's report [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1228s) we can see in the previous email we can see that that Pro-West wasn't at liberty to disclose who his client was, but now we know, we have this report which is, and he said to David Wallace, this is his client is Brad Mitchell. Um and the report says ProWest Investigation and Protection Inc, Investigation Update Report, Date July the 10th 2020\. So you know, the date is exactly when Stuart [Morse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1259s) was, you know, requesting all these hacked emails from the hacker, and the client is Brad Mitchell, subject is Richard Marsh and Kenesha Green. "Dear Mr. Mitchell, once again, thank you for allowing ProWest Investigation and Protection Inc to assist you in the above captioned matter. In accordance with your instructions, an ongoing investigation into the activities of Richard Marsh and Kenesha Green was undertaken."

Okay, so next page. This isn't the whole of it. This is just some parts I've pulled out. Now, this is interesting. This is the next page. So, again, it's headed ProWest Investigation. A search of bank records, credit applications, vehicle and property searches have not provided any leads into Marsh's whereabouts. A bank record search has indicated that Marsh had three accounts in Regina, Saskatchewan with approximately $2,700 in one [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1316s) the accounts. Of note, he has not changed the mailing address on any of the accounts from when he resided in Regina. I mean, that's his spelling mistake. It's believed that Marsh keeps his money offshore and carries foreign credit cards. I've never had a credit card in my life.

When he is in Canada, he stays in hotels and rents vehicles. Also completely untrue. Marsh is extremely computer savvy. Oh, I wish I was. And uses all social media platforms available and does a good job at masking his identity. The same is said regarding current phone numbers, addresses, email addresses or employment for Marsh. And then it says investigative details, targets, T1, Richard Jeremy Marsh, blah, blah, blah.

T2, Kenesha Green, black female, married Marsh in Jamaica. R1, Green's current address. R2, possible address for Marsh. I have no idea where they got that from. That's never been there. You weren't there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1379s)

David knows you weren't there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1382s)

R3, possible UK address in residence of Uncle Richard Marsh. And then H1, I don't know what all these codes mean, employed at Nices E-Treat when my wife worked. So, you know, this is just a page, probably page two of this investigative report that Stuart Morse, a nearly 80-page report that Stuart Morse had put together for Brad Mitchell and has now been sent, or 10 pages of it, have been sent to David Wallace for [David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1412s) Wallace to turn into a skip trace report, which is basically the same thing as an investigative report, and to turn it into some affidavits. Now, there's an interesting point about this page in particular. It says a bank record search has indicated that Marsh had three accounts and approximately $2,700 in one account. And that bank record search revealed my email address for those accounts. Now, the interesting thing [is,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1442s) David will confirm this, that unless you have a warrant from a court, you can't do a bank record search. A private investigator can't search and find out what bank accounts you have, the addresses associated with those accounts, and the amount of money in those accounts. That's obviously extremely private information. So the question is, and the interesting thing is, this is accurate. I did have three accounts in Regina. I did have $2,700, [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1472s) of the accounts. And that actually gives away where they got this information from. Because the only date on which I had those three accounts in Regina and that money in one of those accounts was in the summer of 2017\.

I moved to Regina for one year at the beginning of 2017, at which point I had $5,000 in my bank account. By the middle of the summer of 2017, I would have had approximately $2,700 in the account. And at the end of 2017, I left Saskatchewan and closed all the accounts. So this record they've obtained was obtained probably in August of 2017\. [Now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1520s) there's a very interesting point here because in the August of 2017, I was working in Regina and I used to, I was working a night shift and in the day, particularly in the summer, because the air conditioning in my apartment wasn't good, I would spend the day in the city library in the middle of the town. Very nice library. And in the August of 2017, um I was working with my computer, my laptop, at one of the desks in the library. I walked away from the desk to take a phone [call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1550s) because other people were walking and working and I didn't want to disturb them by talking. When I came back to my desk, my computer had been stolen. Someone had walked off with my laptop. Now in September of 2017, a month after my laptop had been stolen, my Facebook account was hacked, accessed rather, I should say accessed because someone had the password to my Facebook account and [accessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1580s) my Facebook account, locked me out of it, and also all my other social media was was hacked and my website was closed down by some party who mysteriously had obtained the passwords to all those different social media accounts. Now of note, in particular I got a notification from Facebook because when someone different, a different computer, accesses your social media, Facebook sends you a notification [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1611s) your account has been logged into from this IP address. Now the IP address that logged into my Facebook account in the September of 2017 was an IP address that belongs to a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church-owned company from the UK. Now, most IP addresses are geographical. They relate to an area. But if you've got a big business, you have your own specific IP address that belongs to you. And this particular [IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1641s) address belonged to Granta Processes, which is a Brethren-owned business in the UK. So we know for certain that in September 2017,

the Brethren had passwords to all of my social media. And the obvious conclusion is that whoever stole my computer was some kind of a private investigator, probably an illegal private investigator, hired by the brethren who had been watching me in Regina, followed me around, saw the opportunity to steal my computer, obviously passed it on to the brethren who used it to access [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1683s) social media. And at the same time, of course, they got access to my bank statements. So they knew what bank accounts I had and the balance in the account. So you know, straight away we have proof of very illegal activity on the part of the brethren and that they have illegally accessed my bank accounts and uh under claiming that it was a bank record search.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1708s)

Yeah, so here's a bank record search, maybe maybe not a legal one, but...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1713s)

Well, I mean, I'm sure David has ways and means of doing bank record searches but I'm equally sure that they're not legal. Um...

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1719s)

You'd be correct in that assumption.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1723s)

So here's another page. Here's another page. There's a picture of my... it's actually a really nice picture of my wife. So this is a picture of me and my wife. This is this is part of Stuart Morse's report and it says um, "Investigation timeline and surveillance. November the 2nd. It was confirmed that Kenisha Green is employed at Nices E-Treat in Scarborough by KP." Now, I don't know who KP is, presumably a private investigator working for Stuart Morse. "After purchasing a meal and noticing [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1753s) name of Kenisha Green was on the receipt." And I mean, the whole this whole hunt that went on where my wife was harassed and everything in Scarborough, Ontario, that that's another story, but yes, it's true that um private investigator, you know, rather blatantly and obviously spent the whole day sitting in this small Jamaican restaurant and trying to purchase something so as to get a receipt that had my wife's name on it. Um the private investigator isn't, you know, not not not a very [smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1783s) guy because on the first day he did it, in spite of having these nice photos, he followed the wrong girl home. I mean, it's a Jamaican restaurant, all the employees are Jamaican, right? And this poor girl who doesn't particularly look like my wife, except having the same color skin, was followed home by this private investigator, was very alarmed by it, reported it to the restaurant manager. And on the next day, the private investigator, you know, got his spectacles out again and um had another look and actually [managed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1813s) to find the right Jamaican home. But you know, this this just confirms the account that we've spoken about elsewhere how my wife was followed and harassed by private investigators. Okay, so

The first email was instructing David that they want a skip trace report and affidavits. And this is where it gets very interesting because now Gerald Chipeur, and copying in a whole bunch of other lawyers, is sending to David a draft report that condenses and makes compelling, note the coded language there, the information we received from you. "David, [please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1857s) utilize this document for your final report. I understand you will receive further information tomorrow from the criminal records that may be available on Richard Marsh. Thank you for your assistance." Well, you know, I don't have a criminal record. Signed Gerry. Yeah, signed Gerald D. Chipeur. Yeah, signed Gerry. It's all very first name terms, isn't it? He was...

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1877s)

...very helpful. All I had to do was show up at the lawyer's office and sign my name to a report that was already done. It was a quick, uh, quick 5k to pick it up and then I could get to real work and and go and find Richard.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1892s)

What were you thinking at this point in time? Like at this point in time, you're not realizing that this is a Christian group or anything like that, right?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1901s)

No, not at all. I mean, at this point I had uh received all the reports and paperwork that they had. I read through them. After the first reading through, I had a pretty good idea where Mr. Marsh would be. Um Stu was not exactly a genius. He had uh he had been sitting on top of Richard for quite some time and um I mean the answers to where he was were there. I mean he hadn't really gone anywhere. Um you know, it it was a little bit of a surveillance to [figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1932s) out... they they'd assume that Richard already left one location when he was still dug in like a tick. In backyards late at night to jump over hedges and fences to get where he needed to be. And I think if you if you looked at the phone records that they had, they already had their answers. Yeah, I had gone back and forth. Gerry or one of his associates had been kind enough to write my skip trace for me. I showed up at a Miller Thompson office in in the GTA [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=1962s) swore to it and signed it. I'd already told these gentlemen prior to that I was not a private investigator, that I was not licensed, that I could find this man. That was one of the things that I did. I was able to find people, but it was not primarily in my wheelhouse.

I had been given the impression from Alan Hallman that this situation to locate Richard was becoming desperate, that they had spent a great deal of money and had utilized police and private investigators and even ex-military at that point to find Richard, and had come up dry. So I was offered an obscene amount of money to locate him.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2009s)

So just focusing on this, just taking a pause at this document here, because there's an important point here that hasn't really been brought out in the past. Initially, you were hired to provide the skip trace and the affidavit. Yes. They gave you Stuart Morse's skip trace and they just wanted you to rewrite that in your own name so they could then submit it to the court. Absolutely. Now, what they were, their [strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2039s) at this point was to use a process called examination of judgment debtor, which is a legal process whereby if someone owes money and you can't find them, if you can prove to the court that they're trying to evade service, trying to evade paying their debts, you can in extreme circumstances get the court to issue an arrest warrant whereby the person you're seeking [either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2069s) has to turn up at the court and give full details of his, you know, address, telephone number, contact details, bank accounts, assets, or they will issue an arrest warrant for you and the police will go and look for you and bring you in. So strategy number one the brethren had up to this point was to try and get an arrest warrant for me in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Ontario. And I think the reason they were trying to do this in three different provinces, although obscenely expensive to do, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2100s) is that they weren't really sure where I was. So they'll cover all the bases. They'll do these three provinces because they think I'm in one of these three provinces. In order to get that court judgment, which would say you must attend court as a judgment debtor or we're going to put an arrest warrant out for you, they have to submit an affidavit to the court that shows that they've made every effort to find this guy and that the guy is evading [service.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2130s) And they really need to show that he's a guy of, you know, dangerous and unpleasant character. And the only way to deal with this man is to send the police in to get him because, you know, life and limb is threatened. So now if we move on, so they sent to David to sign draft skip trace reports to try and reinforce the idea that I was a dangerous character. So if we move on to the next page, you can see what they sent David to sign and [submit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2161s) to the court. Okay, now when they, you may say, well, why didn't they use the Stuart Morse... why didn't they use Stuart Morse to do this? The reason is that Stuart Morse was already compromised. They realized that Stuart Morse's hacker was actually a friend of mine and they realized that if they went to the court with a document from Stuart Morse, I would respond by producing 33 emails from Stuart Morse in which he was soliciting [hacked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2191s) emails and hacked details. They couldn't use the name of Stuart Morse, so they needed another name to put at the bottom of the report. So they wanted to use David Wallace's name. And they needed someone who was, pardon me, David, but a little unscrupulous, someone who wasn't too firmly attached to the letter of the law, because this is all very dodgy from a legal perspective. And then they hit on a problem that David Wallace was not a private investigator. In fact, David Wallace had [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2221s) been released from jail two years previously, um and as a whether, as a person with a criminal record, he couldn't legally be a private investigator. So they hit on a solution to this. Sorry, David, to spill your dirt, but it's just true. Um so Gerald Chipeur has a solution to this. He can't say that David's a private investigator. So Gerald Chipeur invents a company, invents a non-existent [corporation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2251s) And this is what Gerald Chipeur writes at the top of his report. He says, "Private and confidential, this report provided by four-wall investigative services at the client's request, named herein, is confidential and to the client's use only, blah, blah, blah." And then it goes on, "Investigative detail, subjects, Richard Marsh," and so on and so on. So what they've done is, because they can't use David's name as a private [investigator,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2282s) they invent a completely fictitious company called Four Wall Investigative Services, and they put David Wallace down as investigations coordinator to kind of excuse the fact that they can't quote his private investigator license. This is an email that comes in. So by now, we're kind of into January 2021\. So this is an email from Brad Mitchell of Klondike Lubricants. He's a director of the Universal Business Team. He's a director of a [business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2312s) which is owned by Dean Hales, Bruce Hales' son. And he's probably the most influential Brethren member in the whole of Canada.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2320s)

He's going to listen to this and his ego is going to be like, yeah, I am prominent.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2324s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2325s)

Not prominent in the good ways, Brad. Not prominent in the good ways.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2329s)

Yeah. Okay, so now we're at the point where Gerald Chipeur has supplied to David Wallace the draft of the documents that he wants David to sign as if they were his own investigation rather than Stuart Morse's investigation. Documents that purportedly come from a completely fictitious private investigation company. And so this is an email now from Brad Mitchell, prominent leader of the Plymouth Brethren, to Gerald Chipeur, which David was copied into. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2360s) this is January the 17th, 2021\. "Gerry, could I get an update ASAP today on whether you've been able to make progress since our last call on Richard Marsh? Was thinking of moving forward on the Saskatchewan court order and the sheriffs on his Saskatchewan bank accounts. Global is pretty urgent on an update. Thanks very much. Kind regards, Brad Mitchell, Klondike Lubricants." So as I was saying, their strategy at this point was [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2390s) use court orders, actually in three different provinces. This is just referring to the Saskatchewan one, which was further ahead than the others to, you know, basically drag me into court or get an arrest warrant for me. There's a reply to this email, which is the next slide. Okay, so from Gerald Chipeur to Brad Mitchell, "Re: RM Update Today. Let us talk at your convenience. Is now a good time? I can advise that we're in process of the [following.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2420s) One, through the Sheriff's Office in Saskatchewan, causing enforcement of garnishes and writs. Two, preparing an application for an order requiring Richard Marsh to attend an examination in aid of execution," which is what I was talking about, examination of a debtor. "And three, preparing an application for the registration of the UK judgment in Alberta." And this is from Gerald Chipeur. So the background to this is I had some debts from the UK [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2451s) I'd lost a court case in the UK and the court said, "Well, you've got to pay the other party's costs." And so they registered that cost judgment. They registered that cost judgment in different provinces in Canada. And this is what they were using to try and make out that I was a big debtor and they had to use the court to hunt me down. So we can see from here that they were well ahead with this process in Saskatchewan and they were starting to register it in Alberta. And we also know that they were doing the same thing in [Ontario.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2481s) So at this point, there was a change in plan. This is where it gets really interesting because what they realized is that even if they succeeded

in persuading the courts that, you know, that they should have an arrest warrant for me, that process would take them about a year to go through. And at some point at this time, they got a message from Global or from the Hales family that, "No, a year's too long, we need to hunt this guy down now." So at this point, and this is January the 17th, 2021, there was a change of plan and they're offering David Wallace a retainer [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2521s) hunt me down. So this is not just to prepare a report based on Stuart Morse's investigation. At this point, they say, "David, find this guy and we'll pay your retainer to do it." And so this is an email from Gerald Chipeur to David Wallace. "The client is very happy with your previous assistance." That presumably refers to the, you know, the affidavits and so on. "Please call me. They would like to speak to you about a retainer to track this guy down." Gerald [Chipeur,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2552s) QC, providing services on behalf of a professional corporation partner, Miller Thompson LLP. This is very professional. This is like hiring a criminal to provide false affidavits and a false name and to hunt down innocent men. Good for Gerry. Okay, so on the same day as Gerald Chipeur um messages David Wallace, he he sends a message to Brad Mitchell and a new character [enters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2582s) the scene here. The message is copied to Rod Diplock. Rod Diplock is a very wealthy, very prominent member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church from San Francisco in the in the USA. He is a director of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2600s)

If anybody watched podcast 110 with that priestly visit audio, Rod Diplock was paired with Mick Strange in that brutal, brutal interrogation they did on a teenager. So here's Rod Diplock again.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2616s)

Yeah. So the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is incorporated in the USA, and it has three directors, and one of them is Rod Diplock. So this is like right at the top. Rod Diplock is also a director of Schiavano Consulting, which is a business owned by Dean Hales, son of Bruce Hales, who's the leader of the Plymouth Brethren.

So we now got Brad Mitchell, you know, top man in Canada, Rod Diplock, top man in the USA on the team hunting me down. And Gerald Chipeur's message to these two gentlemen is, "David Wallace, the PI in Toronto, is available to speak anytime today. He has a great strategy to share." Gerald Chipeur. Although they know he's not a PI, this is what they're calling him. So yeah, I don't know why they said you're in Toronto because you [weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2669s) in Toronto but you were in Ontario, I suppose.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2672s)

In Ontario, uh yeah. I was confident after reading the reports and conversations with Alan Hallman, who was friends with Gerald Chipeur. Yeah, I was confident that I could locate you quickly and uh so I struck a a a nice financial deal with these guys. Um they had assured me that the warrants that they had promised would be in place. Um so I obtained photographic evidence that I had you in my sights, yeah, and um [basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2703s) about a week or so after that, that's when things went haywire and I discovered that there were no warrants, yes, their real intentions were, and uh...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2713s)

Yes, I mean, they told you at this point that they had one, while the fact was they were at least a year off from getting warrants, even with the fake affidavits that you had provided them. So they were lying to you as well as to the law and everyone else and probably lying to themselves.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2728s)

I told them too that the once that I had you in sight to do what I needed to do to bring you in, that I needed those warrants available immediately. And they assured me that they would be available immediately because part of the the strategy was to use an associate of mine who had extremely strong ties to Toronto Police Service and uh use the Toronto Police Service to execute those warrants when you were basically in the in the box, so to speak. So I was very concerned [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2762s) this was highly legally or legally questionable to begin with. I was extremely concerned that

any arrest that took place was done by the book so there wouldn't be any legal blowback on me.

I mean, what eventually was proposed to me amounted to kidnapping. Yes. When I took a hard out, so to speak.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2789s)

So so at this point, we've got two strategies. They're continuing with their efforts to to get search warrants, but they're also they're also now paid... in in addition to having paid you a very substantial sum just for signing affidavits and reports that they had written, which again, of course, you can't pay people to write an affidavit, you can only pay their costs, you can't actually pay people to give evidence in court. Um so I mean that alone was illegal. They're now also [paying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2819s) you separately, by separate means, to hunt me. Um now the payment for the affidavits was coming directly from Gerald Chipeur or through Alan Hallman, um but the payment for hunting me down, what this was paid directly by the brethren, um as we'll see later. So this is a reply to the previous email. This is from Rod Diplock, and it's from Control Tech USA. So one of his businesses, as well as the Shavano Consulting, is Control Tech USA, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2849s) is a massive cash-handling business. It supplies the little bags you put cash in for banks and supplies for casinos and so on. It's a dodgy kind of business. Was that out of New Jersey, that company? I think it was.

I think they got an office there, but it's basically San Francisco, I think. But they've got an office in Canada now. They've got a depot in Canada. So...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2871s)

I just want to say that this is addressed to Brad Mitchell and Gerald Chipeur.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2877s)

Yeah, so this is from Rod Diplock, from the director, the director of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in the USA, to Brad Mitchell and to Gerald Chipeur. And it's obviously copied to David or forwarded to David afterwards. So, "Re: RM Update Today. That's great. Can we set up a call this afternoon for two Pacific time? Kind regards, Rod Diplock, CEO, Control Tech." And now we go and we see how they set up that call. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2907s) now there's another player comes in and this is Suzanne Railton. Suzanne Railton is a top executive assistant at Universal Business Team. The Universal Business Team is Bruce Hales' business and it's the financial core of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. In fact, you could reasonably say that Universal Business Team owns Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Absolutely.

So, again, the Brethren have denied any knowledge of any of this happening. They've actually sent a legal letter saying, "We had no knowledge of any of this happening at all." This email is from Suzanne Railton to David Wallace. And it is an invitation to join the scheduled Zoom meeting. And the meeting URL, note this, the URL for the Zoom meeting is ubteam.zoom.us. So this is actually a Universal Business Team Zoom meeting that they've arranged to discuss my um apprehension here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2971s)

And if we want to just like update everybody, if you haven't been keeping up with the articles that are going on about UBT, the UBTA department was shut down recently due to...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=2985s)

...the accounts department, which is the brains of the whole thing, the financial heart and brains of UBT is UBTA. We'll speak more about UBTA later because the UBTA director comes into the scene fairly soon. So they had this Zoom meeting and you know, they obviously went over David's strategy. This is another email from Brad Mitchell. This is a very interesting email. So from Brad Mitchell. Now this time, Brad Mitchell is using his UBT email address. So Brad [Mitchell's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3015s) a director of UBT to Bread and Circus, which is one of David Wallace's email addresses. Um subject, "I am sharing cell phone records with you. Cell phone records.pdf. Dave, please see the attached phone record. We will organize funds here soon. One of my guys is in hospital, so he normally was. Anything else you need from us? Be good to get a game plan from you once you have it. Kind regards, Brad Mitchell." [Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3045s) the attachment to this email is really alarming and that's the next slide. And David will remember receiving this. This is a list of phone numbers and it's dated July 15th, 2020\. This is from six months previously. "Received list of numbers for cell phone 437-239-2754, Kenesha Green." She's changed the number since, so you don't need to call her. "For the period of November 1, 2020 [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3076s) December 22, 2020."

And then there's a list of how many is it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\. There's a list of about 20 phone numbers. And for each phone number, it says the number of times it was called. So some of them were called 10 times, some one were called five times at one time. And then there's a column that gives for several of them, or most of them, the actual name it was called. And so this is my wife's phone log. This is a log of my wife's [phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3110s) account. And we don't even get itemized phone bills. It was just the cheapest possible phone plan. We didn't have access to this information. So this can only have been obtained illegally by some form of bribery with the phone company, with Freedom Mobile, or whatever it was, TalkTalk, I think we were using back then. And that somehow Brad Mitchell had obviously, this is obviously completely illegal, complete breach of privacy, breach of of Charter [Rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3140s) of Privacy in Canada. It obtained my wife's private phone log and it shows she phoned Centennial College four times, Nices E-Treat where she worked seven times,

the West End Prince Hotel five times, that's because she was trying to get a job there. Pizza, pizza. And, well, Pizza, Pizza, 10 times. There's the police on here.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3165s)

You were the one eating pizza.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3167s)

Yeah, so Toronto Police 42 Division Detective Office 10 times and Toronto Police 42 Division 6 times. Now those calls to the police were made because this is the period when she was being stalked through Toronto by Stuart Morse's operatives. And she was being followed on the bus to school. She was being followed to work. She was having PIs hanging around outside her workplace and waiting for her to come out. And of course, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3197s) she would be stalked, she would phone the police and report it. And the police would, you know, sometimes they would come and they would, you know, send the private investigator packing. But this actually shows just how intense that surveillance and harassment of my wife was. And inside one month, she had to call the police 16 times to get private investigators off her back. That's insane.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3222s)

Yeah. So David, in your opinion, in your line of work with what you used to do, how would someone obtain a phone record log like this?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3231s)

There's only two ways. You either have to have somebody on the inside in the uh in the courts, uh judiciary, uh policing, or somebody inside the mobile carrier. Um with the brethren, knowing what I know now, the odds were, I would believe for this type of report, this is something that came from from law enforcement. That's my belief.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3255s)

I mean, one place it may have come from is actually Stuart Morse himself because Stuart, this is the period when Stuart Morse was operating. Stuart Morse is an ex-cop and he has police service and of course he has a whole lot of contact inside the police force. Of course, it's completely illegal for anyone inside the police force to obtain information like this and pass it outside. But it's quite possible that Stuart Morse got this from one of his police contacts inside the [Calgary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3285s) police, which is a notoriously corrupt police force, David, isn't it? So yeah, so this is this is again, the the bank records they obtained illegally, the phone records they've obtained illegally. And this is a top case, you know, top leading Canadian lawyer, counsel for Conservative Party and a mainstream Christian church, we're told.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3309s)

And this was attached to Brad Mitchell's email, just so we remind everybody that this was attached.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3316s)

This was the attachment to Brad Mitchell's email to David Wallace. Okay, so now Brad Mitchell is contacting David Wallace by WhatsApp. And this is about the funds. "It's Brad Mitchell. We're setting up a wire tomorrow." And note the date on this. It's January the 20th, 2021\. So, okay, so this is this little section here which relates to how David was paid. So, Brad Mitchell and Rod Diplock are promising to wire him money. And this is an email [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3347s) David Wallace under his pseudonym of John Nada to Westwind44. Now, Westwind44, that's one of Rod Diplock's private email addresses. Westwind is the name of a now OneSchool Global school trust that was set up back when it was Sterling Education in the USA. So Rod Diplock was obviously a a trustee of that children's education trust and this is one of his email addresses. So this is David Wallace to [Rod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3377s) Diplock. "Invoice for week ending February the 7th. Here's the breakdown of this week's expenses. Weekly fee, $5,000 Canadian dollars. Telecom expenses, $2,300 Canadian dollars. Edmonton Manpower, $500 Canadian dollars. Total, $7,800 Canadian. David." Okay, and then underneath this, there's the reply or the forwarding of the same email from Westwind44, so from [Rod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3408s) Diplock, to Fresti, in inverted commas, F-R-E-S-T-E-Y, subject "Re: RM Brad please advise." So we can see from this that Fresty is some kind of a nickname for Brad Mitchell. And you know, if anyone out there knows why Brad Mitchell is called Fresty, um you know, please email us and we'll publicize the fact. And so they're kind of figuring out amongst them how they're going to pay [David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3438s) Wallace while trying to keep their hands clean. And we'll see in the next item how they did that. So this is a section from David Wallace's TD Bank Bank Statement from the period. And what we see is payments coming in from Tilsonburg Tube, February the 17th, 2021, $3,500.

February the 9th, 2021, Tilsonburg Tube, $7,800. January the 31st, 2021, Tilsonburg Tube, five thousand dollars. January uh the 21st, 2021, Tilsonburg Tube, five thousand dollars. As well as, um as well as money coming in from Jonathan Dennis, which is another story. You can you can Google Jonathan Dennis and see what he was up to, uh another customer of yours, David. And Hallman Associates, which is course Alan [Hallman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3491s) So the payments to David Wallace were not made directly by either Rod Diplock or Brad Mitchell. They were made by yet another prominent leading member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which is Keith Prince, or also known as the Prince of Darkness, who's a Brethren business leader from Tilsonburg in Ontario. He owns this business called Tilsonburg Tube. He's [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3522s) trustee of the local meeting room trust which has about one and a half million dollars sitting in it. And he's also the guy who made a seven thousand five hundred dollar donation to a third party advertiser which spent the money putting up huge billboard posters attacking Justin Trudeau at the last election and subsequently received a three hundred thousand dollar grant from the conservative Ontario government for his business, Tilsonburg [Tube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3552s) So that's Keith Prince. We'll see more about Keith Prince later. But this is how David was paid for this investigation.

Okay, so now we're kind of taking a jump back. And this is, again, relates to the affidavits that they had, that Gerald Chipeur was paying David to sign, to fill in and sign. So this is from Miller Thompson office in Saskatchewan. Gerald Chipeur is leading the operation. He's in Calgary. But this is, they're trying to register this court order. They're trying to get this affidavit against me in Saskatchewan. So it's from Brooklyn [Faisal,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3592s) Miller Thompson, to David Wallace.

Subject, draft affidavit. Attachment, Saskatchewan draft affidavit of private investigator, a document number so and so on. And it says, "Hi David, as discussed, please see enclosed the draft affidavit. Please review and revise as you see fit. Please ensure that all the information you include is directly within your personal knowledge and of course truthful. I have enclosed the email I previously referenced for your review. Let me [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3625s) if you have any questions. Thank you, Brooklyn Faisal, associate, Miller Thompson LLP, Regina, Saskatchewan." So this is the draft affidavit that they sent to David Wallace. Now, of course, normally you ask someone for an affidavit, they write the affidavit. This blew me over the top\! This affidavit was written by Gerald Chipeur with little gaps and lines in for David to fill in odd words. And they were paying him $5,000 to fill in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3655s) affidavit. Good work if you can get it. Good work if you can get it. It's a good gig if you can get it. Okay, so this is an affidavit. This is a formal document. I'm reading it out for the sake of people who are not actually just listening and haven't got the visual. It's Form 13.31. Court file number, QBG number, that's Queen's Bench. That's the Court of the Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan. Court file number, Court of the Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan. There are some things that have been redacted [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3686s) The applicant's name is redacted. The respondent, that's the person that they're charging is Richard Marsh. And then it says affidavit, affidavit of David Wallace. "I, David Wallace of blank blank," this is space for him to fill in his address, "make oath and say or affirm."

One, "I'm a private investigator with," and then there's a blank space with a little highlighted tab for him to fill in the name of his private investigator business, formal investigations, of course, which doesn't actually exist and he's not really a private investigator. Right? Yeah, it's not even a private investigator. So yeah. And then number two, "I was retained by," and then there's a blank space for him to fill in who is retained by, "in or around," and then there's a space for him to put on the date when he was retained [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3736s) the applicant to investigate the whereabouts of Richard Marsh for the purpose of various legal proceedings.

Three, "It is my opinion that Richard Marsh has been actively hiding his whereabouts for years for the purpose of evading service of any documents related to court proceedings." Okay, then the next screen is, I haven't put the whole thing in, it's very long, I've just put in some sections of it. So this is line six of the same affidavit. "After significant efforts, I have recently located Richard Marsh in or around blank space in a tab saying, you know, they would fill this in." Seven, "[My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3774s) research indicated that Richard Marsh was residing at this address with his wife." Eight, "During my attendance at the above address on February the 2nd, 2021, I observed Richard Marsh." And then there's a blank space, and then there's like a highlighted tab saying, "add further details, i.e. moving boxes." "This led me to believe that Richard Marsh was moving away from the above noted dress."

Nine, "After briefly observing Richard Marsh, I approached him in an attempt to seek his cooperation."

Ten, "I observed what I believed were friends of Richard Marsh with him at this time." 11\. "My approaching Richard Marsh and his friends quickly escalated into acts of physical violence against both me and my associate present at crime. Note, confirm and add details." 12\. "As a result of the altercation, both my associate and I suffered various bruises and two black eyes. Note, [confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3840s) and add details." Now this, needless to say, is a complete fabrication. David Wallace never observed me moving boxes at any address ever. He never approached me to seek my cooperation. We never had a fight. I didn't have friends with me. No one had black eyes. No one had bruises.

The whole thing is not only completely fictional and made up, it's also highly improbable because if you consider, David Wallace was like hired as a private investigator. If you're a private investigator and you finally see someone that you're supposed to be investigating, you don't approach them and seek their cooperation. You you watch them and find out where they're going. You don't go pick a fight with a guy. This account is completely fictitious, isn't it?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3897s)

Oh, absolutely. It was creative writing at its finest. I looked at it, laughed, and signed it, whatever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3904s)

So we now have the private investigator who isn't a private investigator belonging to the private investigation company that doesn't exist, producing a completely fictitious affidavit that clearly states that Richard Marsh is resident at a completely fictitious address and had a completely fictitious fight with a fictitious private investigator resulting in fictitious black eyes and bruises to both him and his associate. I mean, I would add that if I did get [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3934s) a fight with David Wallace, I think I would come off an awful lot worse because he's one tough bugger, um and I would be hightailing it out of there as fast as my legs could carry me. Um so this is this is what David was paid $5,000 to sign. And as he said, it's good work if you can get it.

So this is the bottom of the same affidavit. Line 19\. "I believe the best chance for enforcement against Richard Marsh is to have him appear for an examination for the purpose of disclosing his assets." Well, it wouldn't take long to disclose my assets. 20\. "I make this affidavit in support to an application seeking leave to proceed directly to an examination of judgment debtor sworn before me via electronic means this blank day of February 2021."

So this is, you know, this is the level of honesty of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and their lawyers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3990s)

Were red flags coming up for you at this point, David?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=3994s)

Yeah, they were starting to come up. I mean, uh I had located Richard fairly rapidly already using the tools that uh dumb dumb, uh uh ex-cop there, Stu Morse had already had. Um some other names have been kicked off of Dennis Rag that had come up. So I geofenced his house. Uh wasn't long to discover where Richard was. I also used a source I had within the CRA [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4025s) uh do a little bit of check on Richard's tax return, which certainly narrowed things down for me. So I was just about ready to go, but these flags were popping up. So I decided to look into Richard myself and find out exactly who he was. And that's when I came across the, I believe it was peebs, uh Richard's uh blog site. And all of a sudden, things had taken on a completely different complexion. And um [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4055s) I provided photographic evidence to these people that I had located Richard, uh I was still being a little cagey on his exact whereabouts because of course, you know, I was averaging 5, 10 G's a week with these guys.

That's when they hit me up with another proposal about the uh sitting prime minister of Canada. Yeah, my my back was up at this point because things weren't starting to add up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4079s)

Yeah, you were starting to question, yeah, scratch the head and be like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4082s)

The kind of stuff with the the affidavits and so was probably uh, you know, a kind of a the low level kind of criminality that you were familiar with in the rat business of dragging down politicians.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4096s)

Standard operating procedure there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4098s)

There was kind of, there was a sense at this point that there was something a lot dirtier and darker than mere politics behind this.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4106s)

Yeah, it didn't... you don't throw this much in terms of resources, the individuals who were involved, um such as a Gerald Chipeur, various police detectives who I had access to databases, uh people like Brad Mitchell and Rod Diplock, who once I did my background on them, they seemed far too high profile to be worried about a petty...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4133s)

...collecting a debt.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4134s)

...as [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4138s) portray you. So there was definitely a lot of alarm bells going off by this point.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4146s)

So this is an email from Westwind44, who as we know is Rod Diplock, to David Wallace. "David, I called Brad tonight and he said that the wire missed yesterday but is going tomorrow morning. Sorry, I've been out of pocket and trying to catch up. This is Rod. Also, I asked Brad to try and get a hold of you tonight, probably a bit late there. Now, can we loop the wagons together in the morning and discuss where we are, please?" But [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4176s) email just kind of amused me because you can sense the mentality of the brethren toss that was out hunting me is that they think they're these kind of wild west gangsters out in the out in the desert hunting down, you know, bad Indians or something. And they're gonna loop the wagons together and see where we are. And you can imagine them kind of thrashing behind the barrels, you know, with their with their muzzle loaders looking out for baddies on the horizon as, you know, with their [millions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4207s) and millions of dollars and the police and the law and everyone else against me, they hunt down the dangerous outlaw Richard Marsh. Um it's also it's just this kind of mentality of, you know, we're out there hunting the baddies, you know. So I don't I don't think Brad actually meant to say was out of pocket, uh Rod was meant to say was out of pocket. I can't imagine Rod being out of pocket. I think he probably meant he was out of town, but...

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4233s)

Well, if he was out of pockets, mine were overflowing by that point thanks to these.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4235s)

Well, yeah, exactly. This this next email is, and this is what David was just mentioning before. Now another another assignment comes along for David Wallace and this doesn't actually relate to me at all. They've realized that David Wallace has got a very unique skill set in the political arena and of course the brethren have very strong political interests. So they're now wondering whether they can get David to help them with a little political problem that the brethren have. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4267s) political problem being Justin Trudeau, who they don't like because they like to have right-wing politicians who are in their pocket running the country, not left-wing politicians who aren't interested in doing deals with them. And so this is um February the 14th, 2021\. This is an email from Brad Mitchell to David Wallace, to Suzanne Railton, and to Rod Diplock. "Meeting with David and blank," right, this is an associate of David's [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4297s) we're not we're redacting his name from here. So "Suzanne, can you set up a Zoom meeting for the parties above? We will need to speak tomorrow. There is one other party, David will have the contact information. Kind regards, Brad Mitchell." And then the reply from David Wallace is to Brad Mitchell, "Re: Meeting with David. Nice to meet you Suzanne. Blank's email address is," he gives the email address, "He is available to speak at 4 p.m. Ontario time tomorrow if that's agreeable to all [parties.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4327s) Thank you, David." So you had this Zoom meeting with these various high level brethren parties. David, what was it they were wanting to talk to you about?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4337s)

Uh well by this point, uh Mr. Mitchell and Diplock were overjoyed once they had received the photographic evidence of your uh existence in in Ontario. Um so they uh had been speaking with Alan Hallman and Alan Hallman had filled them in on exactly what I did for a living and they came up with the bright idea that uh perhaps we could sit and discuss and I could come up with a scenario which would lead to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4367s) eventual removal of Justin Trudeau. You have to keep in mind at this point in time, Justin Trudeau was still, they considered, unassailable in that position. They were cycling through leaders at this point. I believe it had gone from Sheer to O'Toole and the prospects in the near future, they felt that Trudeau wasn't going anywhere. So the meeting that they had arranged were to loosely discuss scenarios [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4398s) what resources and how much it would cost for me to set up a situation which would lead to the removal of Justin Trudeau as the Prime Minister of Canada.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4408s)

And the kind of thing they were talking about, and I think Brad Mitchell actually bragged about this as having been, as having financed this operation, is a few years previously there had been a scandal in some of the less credible right-wing news outlets. Buffalo Chronicle?

Yeah, the Buffalo Chronicle, I think it was. Claiming that Justin Trudeau had had to leave. But before Justin Trudeau was a member of parliament or prime minister, he was a teacher in a private school in somewhere on the west coast, wasn't it? And he left, I think he left the school as a teacher part way through the term.

And there was a sort of scandal that never hit the mainstream media but was just kind of circulated on the dodgy right-wing news outlet saying that the reason Justin Trudeau had to leave that school is that he had had an affair with one of the students in the school, with an underage girl in the school, and this had all been covered up and hush money had been paid. And Brad Mitchell was actually boasting that he and the brethren had been behind the [publication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4480s) of this article. Yes. And indeed, the the if you look up the editor of the Buffalo Chronicle at the time, he was actually offering to publish articles for a fee. So you know, if you wanted to publish some scandal about a politician, you could pay the editor of the Buffalo Chronicle and he would publish it, no questions asked, because the publication house was located in the USA, which made it very hard to sue them for defamation in Canada because of the freedom of speech thing. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4510s) it the tone of the conversation was, "we, you know, David, can you engineer some kind of a scandal that would be sufficient to bring Justin Trudeau down and give the conservatives a chance to get into power?" Is that essentially the tone of the conversation?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4527s)

And it's important to realize that the associate who was with the meeting, we won't mention his name, but he is known internationally as someone who could certainly help arrange that. The the individual has an intelligence background in in a foreign country. He's a Canadian national, but certainly somebody who's known both publicly and privately as someone who does this type of work. So they were certainly not playing, um...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4554s)

And if any, if there are any two people on the planet that could do it, it would be you and your associate.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4559s)

Absolutely. They were they were giving you a blank check to...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4564s)

Yes. Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4566s)

This just breaks my heart. It breaks my heart because my family's in there and they totally are so gullible that this kind of is going on. And I apologize, I'm going on a Cheryl rant here. It's been a few podcasts since I've had one. But this is a mainstream Christian church who in all of the last articles of The Guardian, while the research The Guardian is investigating OneSchool Global, the PBCC's private school, and you go back and you read these articles and the [absolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4597s) lies that they, the spokesperson gives out, and yet we have actual freaking receipts and the man himself who sat down at this Zoom call sitting here thinking that they had the power to take out the Prime Minister of Canada. Like, to the insiders right now, get that through your head. Why the hell are you going and breaking bread with these people? And I think I just, I'm just, I when when I was going through this shit, I mean, I've heard about this story. I I heard, I watched the podcast that you [were on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4627s) Blackballed and uh the other the podcast. So I've watched, I knew this story, but it's just to me, I'm a little riled up due to the Guardian articles and the spokespersons that have come on there and lied through their freaking teeth. And then we sit down and review all this again and my blood was boiling this morning. I didn't even know how I was going to sit down and do this podcast. Do I cry? Do I... I know if I ever get a chance to talk, I know I'm gonna blow, but like my [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4657s) nieces and nephews, my family is stuck inside here, totally believing the bullshit that is coming out of their mouths when in behind these curtains, we have actual receipts of them trying to plan to take down the Prime Minister of Canada. Absolutely evil, insanity business that they have got their hands into. All I say to you guys is it's something that Richard had said on the podcast Growing Up in Polygamy, was about the Titanic. You [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4687s) like there was only enough boats for half of them. I do, like I am at the point now, get the hell out. Just get out. Like you can't, the lies that are happening inside there is a tiny iota of the lies that are actually going on.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4703s)

It's the Stockholm syndrome, right? I mean the the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is not a church. What it is is a very sophisticated criminal organization that poses as a religious organization. It takes advantage of people who are born into this faith. That's the only way you can become part of it. They're born into this faith and they are used as economic drivers, business tools. They're used to generate wealth, wealth for a criminal organization. And and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4734s) difficult because the members of the church can't see that because they've been been conditioned since birth to believe what they're told. Whereas the management, let's call it, the uh the Hales of the world, this guy's nothing more than an obese crime boss. He's certainly not a uh handpicked by God or the grand poobah, whoever you want to talk about. It's it's the same situation with the uh uh Church of [Scientology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4764s) I did a few jobs in

Florida years ago, same sort of situation. I I do have to say they never asked me to kidnap anybody or take out any political leaders, so they're a step ahead on that uh that respect. But what what really set it off for me is these gentlemen asked for this job to be done on a Zoom call. Zoom is notorious and unsecure. Um these conversations end up in in many hands. Uh [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4796s) know, the Five Eyes monitored them. So I knew when they made this approach to me that automatically I had to distance myself because there would be intelligence agencies, not only in this country but to other countries, who would have immediate access to this Zoom call and information. And they do. I've been told through my contacts that the RCMP and CSIS both have a copy of the actual Zoom recording that took place between Rod Diplock, Brad Mitchell, uh Mick Strange, [myself,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4827s) and the other individuals. So very dangerous. Not only arrogance and foolish foolishness, but very, very dangerous to think that a foreign entity was attempting to arrange the overthrow of a duly elected government over a Zoom call. It's pretty funny.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4844s)

Because I mean, only one of the participants here was actually Canadian. Um Rod Diplock is American and you mentioned Mick Strange, I'm glad you did. I've forgotten Mick Strange was also on this call.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4855s)

Now I'm going to insert the clip. I'm going to insert a clip here right here where you, I want you to listen to what Mick Strange is talking like to this teenager and then you can grasp the exactly how David is explaining that this is just a criminal organization. It really is just a criminal organization and these men are ruthless. They are evil, ruthless men. So I'm just going to answer that. So have a listen to this and make your own judgment on these criminal men that are just out for wealth.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4886s)

And I can tell you, I can tell you now, you go to jail first and ask questions later, okay?

You think I'm being funny, play fast and loose with us and you'll find out what it really is.

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4903s)

Mick, I'm not here to play games, like I said.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4907s)

Well, get yourself right, you stupid idiot. Get yourself right.

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4911s)

You think you...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4912s)

You want to go to hell? You want to go to hell? Do you know what hell is? Has your father ever taught you?

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4919s)

Yes, yes he has.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4921s)

Well, don't muck around. Don't be smart to me. Don't be smart to the rest of us on the phone. Get yourself right, and you better get yourself right fast.

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4931s)

I fully agree with that. I just want to reiterate one thing, is that I'm not naive. I know if I actually did do any of these things.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4942s)

Listen to me. You're a stupid, naive idiot, okay?

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4946s)

Okay.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4946s)

You're a stupid, dumb, naive idiot.

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4948s)

You think you're smarter than us? You think you're smarter than Mr. Hales?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4953s)

You think you're smarter than the system we've set on? You're not, okay?

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4957s)

I'm not. I never said that.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4960s)

You're dumb. I'm dumb. You're dumb. You're dumb, okay?

### [**Anonymous 16 year old**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4964s)

And if...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4964s)

you don't wake up to yourself, you'll end up with people like Pilate in the lake of fire. Oh, goodness. Do you want to go there?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=4972s)

Nick. Do you want to go there? Nick. So that's Mick Strange. And this is a call actually with Mick Strange and Rod Diplock, who are both participants in this call about Justin Trudeau. This is them dealing with a little matter of a young brethren member who was also a UBT employee, who they were bragging over the, literally dragging over the coals because of some alleged misdemeanor of his. But another thing that's very important [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5002s) Mick Strange is Mick Strange was a director of UBTA, which is UBT Accountants. Now UBT is the big umbrella group that embraces the whole of the Brethren ecosystem, the whole of the Brethren finances. It's their telecommunications, it's their phones, their computers, their household supplies, their supermarkets. Within UBT, the financial heart of UBT, the brains of it, is UBTA, which does the accounts and [provides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5033s) top level accounting advice, or one might say tax evasion advice, to all the top brethren businesses and actually connects all the brethren business together into a kind of a virtual giant corporation. Now after the Australian Tax Office, the ATO, raided UBT headquarters, what was it, a couple of months ago now.

UBTA suddenly closed their doors. They said, "We're not trading anymore. We'll finish off the accounts for our customers, and then we're closing down. We're gone." So you can, when an entity gets raided by the ATO, the ATO go in, they take away the computers, they take away the records, they unlock the filing cabinets, they take away all the records. And then the financial heart of that organization suddenly, without giving a reason, shuts its doors, you can [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5087s) that, you know, the lights are going out in Bruce Hales' financial empire. So Mick Strange was a director of UBTA, which puts him, as I said, right at the top of the tree and he's an Australian. So this is an Australian, an American, and a Canadian conspiring to bring down the the Prime Minister of Canada. Okay, so at this point, this is the point in time where David

realizes just how serious it is. So at this point, in this kind of sequence of events, there's all these kind of things going on together. And at this point, David has a conversation with Brad Mitchell and others where they ask him to do something that really rings the alarm bells. And it's at this point that David makes the kind of now famous phone call where he's warning me to get out of Dodge because these people are after me. So, [David,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5146s) we're going to play the recording of the phone call. But perhaps before we do that, just tell us what that conversation was with Brad Mitchell that led you to decide to call me and warn me to run.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5159s)

Yeah, Brad was a very odd guy when I would talk to him. Um he's a very unassuming looking individual. He's uh well, he was at the time, you know, a little fat guy. Um very nondescript. But there was a absence of emotion or or, it's hard to put my finger on, but when you would have a conversation with this individual, it was like he was an empty shell. There [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5189s) nothing there. Just um, he had no regard for anybody's personal safety or or... I mean, he referred to uh Kirat Singh, Richard's friend and associate, uh and these are his words, not mine, he called him a "packy." Um he used racist terms uh against Richard's wife, against uh... just the way he spoke, the language, the threats of violence, the uh the actual glee. He'd also had another business matter where he was [supplying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5219s) PPE equipment to a gentleman in Texas that he couldn't collect his money on. Um he had asked me to retain a Hell's Angel, um actually a gentleman named Chuck Zito, used to be the uh one of the top Hell's Angels guys, an actor now I believe. Yeah, he asked me to put him in touch with uh with him, which I did. Um unbelievable.

Yeah, Brad is... there was something chilling about the man. And um he left no doubt to me, um once I I told them, "Okay, I need the warrants, we have Richard in sight." Um he told me in a phone call that there would be a rather substantial bonus wired to me immediately if I would seize Richard's laptop, grab Richard, and that I would be provided with a phone number and a team would show up to collect Richard and his [laptop,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5274s) his hard drive. I was out at that point. I don't do that sort of work. I made it very, very clear that that was something that I was not interested in doing. In fact, I told him I didn't want the job anymore. That's not how this was going to proceed. And they, of course, kept offering more and more money on top. I think it was up to 150 grand at that point as a bonus. Um I felt I had to warn Richard, but I also had concerns that I was being monitored by that point. Um [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5304s) I made a call, the decision to call his friend Kirat Singh, who I knew would relay the message immediately, which was basically to try to tell Richard without telling him, "Look, I know where you are, get the hell out, just go."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5318s)

Okay, let's listen to this again. Just I just want to refresh David's memory on it. The Exclusive Brethren, aka the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, claimed to be a mainstream Christian church led by Australian Bruce Hales. Its 53,000 members donate vast sums of tax-exempt money to the church's charitable trust every year.

Millions of those dollars are spent on aggressive lawyers and private investigators to track, monitor and harass ex-members who escaped the cult's course of control. The sheer scale of abuse has been kept out of the public eye with intensive PR campaigns, lawsuits and political influence, but now their luck has run out.

On February 4th, 2021, a friend of ours, Dr. Kirat Singh from Edmonton received a call from a private investigator working for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. He was being paid $10,000 a week by a manager of the church's finance wing, Universal Business Team, UBT, to hunt down, rob and kidnap PBCC escapee and outspoken critic Richard Marsh. In an intense phone call, the private investigator lifted the curtain on a world of malice, sleaze and crime.

What follows is the audio of that call.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5399s)

...overlapping, and it's very strange that these guys picked me out of a hat. Yeah. And they're throwing me obscene... I mean, nobody pays 10 Gs a week to chase down a guy to serve papers.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5410s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5411s)

And then they sent me an email, and they told me that if I could locate this guy before I do anything or call in a sheriff, they want me to see if I can stake the place out, confiscate his laptop and then call in this number they said they've got a team. So I'm thinking to myself, "What have I gotten myself into here?"

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5431s)

Mm.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5432s)

\-hmm you know, these are not these are not normal people. And I'm doing all this research and it leads back to these wacko religious...

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5438s)

...freaks, yes.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5439s)

And these people out of Vancouver, they... it doesn't make any sense. There's heavy money behind these guys. Yeah. So how... How does this guy Mitchell fit in? This is my contact. His name is Brad Mitchell. And he's been calling me, and every time he gets on the phone, he puts me on pause and he's calling out. He's got some English guy on the phone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5461s)

Brad Mitchell of Vancouver, Canada, owns Klondike Lubricants and is also a manager at UBT, the business arm of the cult. Mitchell is also president of the Christians Gospel Society, a brethren-owned charity in British Columbia, which has assets listed of $15,224,059.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5480s)

He's got another guy on the phone, and they're asking me all these questions. "Okay, do you think he's in Toronto?" Listen, I don't give a shit, because if he's here, he ought to run, because these guys are fanning out. So wherever he is, get out of Dodge. Get out of Dodge. Is there any way you can tell him? What do these people want from him?

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5502s)

Well, I know that they were looking for him because he was excommunicated and making a nuisance of himself to the church.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5507s)

It's got to be more than that. Not for this kind of money, man. It's got to be more than that. They're telling me that they had people following his wife on a bus, that they had people sent out to you, and that they were offering to fly you out to places. And I'm thinking, none of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5519s) adds up.

None of it adds up.

Am I going to be able to shake these people? I mean, I I got a feeling that I mean these these are... this is just not a good vibe. It's none of this is adding up and it just... it's got to be more than just this guy making fun of people or pissing people off. I mean, I'm not getting it. How how big are these people?

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5545s)

The church, it's not a huge church but um very rich apparently and I don't know very much...

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5551s)

There's got to be a way to get it.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5554s)

And so so... So since you spoke to me the other day, they've been contacting you again?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5558s)

Yeah, they're telling me that I've been engaged for the job that I took to deposit and I have to finish it. I'm not finishing a job with these people. I told them I'm getting their money back. I don't want nothing to do with it.

And I don't, I mean, what they're basically asking me to do is illegal.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5575s)

Oh, yeah, there's lots of things that they would do that is illegal.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5578s)

Yeah, but it's more than just illegal. They're talking about, I mean, they're talking about kidnapping.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5583s)

Mm-hmm. Are they specifically explicitly using that word?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5587s)

Not that word, but they sure as hell danced around it. And they're offering all kinds of dough on top of it. So, I mean, look,

I don't understand, but they got all this guy's medical documentation. They got everything. They got everything on this guy's life. Stuff that's supposed to be sealed.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5604s)

Sealed. Mm-hmm. That's heavy duty.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5607s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5608s)

I mean, how much are they offering you, you know, um...

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5611s)

Said I got a blank checkbook to find this guy, and they told me if I could find him within a month, they'll give me a $150,000 bonus.

That's insane for a guy who's a nuisance. That don't add up. They want more from this guy.

He must have the goods on them and something fierce.

Why doesn't he go to law enforcement or something? There's got to be somewhere he can go. I mean, I got access to a few different databases that he doesn't, but I'll tell you one thing. I ain't telling these guys nothing because I don't want my name tied to this if this guy goes missing.

I don't. I know it sounds good. I'm sorry. I'm just, look, these people are giving me the big time creeps.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5654s)

Creeps.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5656s)

Big time creeps. And they're having people reach out to me that are way too big on the chain. You know, to try to change my mind. I don't need to be taking calls from people in Alberta who sit in the premier's office. You know what I'm saying?

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5668s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So who is this Alan Hallman? Can you remind me? Who was that?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5674s)

This Hallman guy was a political organizer for the Premier. He used to be his bogeyman.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5681s)

Okay, okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5685s)

Alan Hallman, former campaign manager for the Premier of Alberta, pressured the PI to complete the illegal orders given by Brethren member Brad Mitchell. Hallman was charged with assault in 2017 at a political conference after being banned from his party and later fined for obstructing the investigation.

The wealthy PBCC, while not allowing their members to vote, has long been known to influence elections financially. Tilsonburg Tube and Brad Mitchell are both listed as donors to a far-right political group that has recently caused controversy by posting attack ads against liberals and national newspapers. Phil Jenner, CEO of Klondike Lubricants, along with 14 other Brethren sources, contributed a total of $31,000 to the campaign.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5732s)

Right. But it's something going on here, man.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5735s)

So they gave you a check?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5736s)

No, they didn't give me no check. They're sending me Interact V transfers five grand at a time from a place called Klondike Mules and another place called Tilsonburg Tube.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5746s)

Tilsonburg Tube, right?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5748s)

Yeah. They're two different, they're said to me for just little businesses.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5756s)

Tilsonburg Tube is owned by another Brethren member, Keith Prince. Prince is also listed as the chairman of Tilsonburg Meeting Room Trust, another of the PBCC's many charities.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5765s)

Like clockwork, every Sunday it comes in.

I want to give them their money back. I don't want to do this.

Like, this is too heavy for me. I don't do this sort of stuff, but that's not what this is about. These guys are hunting this guy.

I'm really, really freaked out about this.

...today and if he's ever heard of this guy named Brad Mitchell. Because that guy is really giving me the creeps.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5800s)

What specifically is he saying to you about?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5802s)

It's how he's saying. The guy, I thought these were religious people, this guy is talking about his wife... I'll give you an example. This is not my words, okay, I'm going to give you a verbatim. He's telling me she's a "coon". And then he's making remarks about about Jews and he's making remarks about this guy's a "packy". This is how he talks.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5821s)

Ok, yeah, thanks.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5822s)

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5842s) guy's supposed to be religious? No, no, no, I'm not being religious about it.

I'm just, you know, I'm ducking these guys' calls and I don't want the same treatment for any religious loonies coming by my place of business and shit. I can't, I don't need that stuff.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5860s)

Yeah, yeah. Hmm. Ok.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5864s)

Just be careful.

### [**Dr. Kirat Singh (Voiced by Richard Marsh)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5867s)

Well, thanks. Thanks for your heads up. Bye.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5874s)

The incident has been reported to the RCMP and there is an ongoing investigation into the illegal and malicious practices of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and Universal Business Team.

Richard Marsh has never met or done any harm to Brad Mitchell, Keith Prince, or their businesses. They have no personal reason whatsoever to harass him. They are just being used as a front for the PBCC. Richard's only crime was leaving the Brethren cult and exposing the extreme corruption and coercion within.

In 2018, the Brethren held meetings inside their churchrooms worldwide with thousands of unsuspecting members, specifically to denounce three named persons as opposers. Members over 18 were then coerced to sign a document promising not to communicate with those persons. Richard Marsh was one of those named. PBCC leader Bruce Hales has publicly referred to opposers, those who have left, as traitors and has said they should take a shot of poison, be shot in the head and take some arsenic. Universal Business Team, which employs [Brad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5934s) Mitchell, is the business arm of the PBCC, employing hundreds of PBCC members worldwide. Amongst other products, UBT sells modified computers and mobile phones to brethren members who risk assembly discipline, shunning from friends and family if they purchase elsewhere. Additional software tracks online activity and centers most of the World Wide Web, allowing PBCC leaders to control flow of information, communication and education. Members are told it's for their protection.

So it's been a while since you've listened to that, I would imagine.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5968s)

Yeah, been a bit, been a bit of time. It's uh that last bit there, it's funny because at the time I was working with certain members of the RCMP and I had called them and told them about Richard and had given Richard the number of my contact to call. And I believe that after Richard called, it was only a help, a day later I got a call from my guys at the RCMP and they completely cut ties with me. They [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=5998s) me that this was way too political and uh they couldn't be involved.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6001s)

Yeah, I called the guy. I had a long conversation with him, but he kind of, yeah, he knew, you know, he he acknowledged that he worked with David Wallace, but he kind of said there wasn't much he could do to help me. So yeah.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6018s)

Which is more concerning.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6020s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6021s)

So after this phone call went out and became public,

what what happened after that? Like in your life, David, what happened in that?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6033s)

Well, they weren't pleased, let's put it that way. Um but uh I got a call from Hallman. He said, "Are you going to give this guy up?" I said, "No." I said, "This is up, Alan, pardon my language, but you know, you got this this one bag of Mitchell who's asking me to kidnap a guy. I don't do that kind of stuff." Um you know, "You guys lied to me." He told me that I would receive five thousand dollars a month as a retainer from the brethren [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6063s) him and basically they just wanted to uh keep tabs on Richard and make sure he didn't leave the country. And they would regroup and get their warrants. And that's how they left it. I received a call shortly afterwards that that uh Alan wanted to bring me out to Alberta, said he had a lot more work for me. Um I was booking many tens of thousands of dollars a month in Alberta for that at that point through another associate of Alan's. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6093s) arranged for me to rent a house in Alberta to come out. When I came out after a couple of weeks, uh that's when the ultimatum came down. All the money that was owed to me, all the work that was forthcoming would not be coming unless I handed Richard over, his immediate whereabouts, and uh...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6112s)

So they tied all your other jobs into giving Richard up.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6118s)

Yep. Yeah. Basically at that point, Chipeur and uh Holman brought a lot of pressure to bear through my other conservative clients and they basically isolated me and starved me out, not to mention ripping me off for tens of thousands of dollars it was already owed. Um yeah, but I wasn't going to give up Richard at that point. It wasn't uh... they're they were pretty stubborn, but I could be a bit stubborn myself too, so it didn't...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6147s)

Do anything. There's receipts about this. So I I got the recording of that phone call that we just listened to, published it on YouTube, and it was published on LinkedIn and everywhere. And of course, everything hit the fan. The brethren flew into a panic because all their dirty schemes were unraveling. And of course, the relationship with David had completely changed because now David was clearly not on their side, but he also had a massive hold over them because they knew [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6177s) as well as the phone call which had already gone out, that David had hundreds of emails from them with their names and addresses on that completely exposed them. So they then flew into panic. "What's David going to do with all his emails, all the messages we've sent him?" And so this is this is this is text message between Alan Hallman, who was in contact with the Brethren, and David Wallace. And David had been checking out the brethren's LinkedIn profiles. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6207s) know, I'd looked at Brad Mitchell, I looked at Mick Strange's LinkedIn and because they are LinkedIn premium, they can see who looks at their profiles. And so Alan Hallman is saying, "The folks notice you checked there, you checked out their LinkedIn. Please don't. It just makes them very nervous. Thanks."

So the brethren are complaining to Alan Hallman that David Wallace is checking out their LinkedIn profiles. It's making them nervous because suddenly this sort of crook and they've unleashed on one of their enemies now is starting to turn its eyes and tentacles towards them.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6241s)

Hallman had no real knowledge of who these people were. At least he didn't seem very knowledgeable. It was a job that was farmed out to him through his buddy Gerry. Yeah. Alan didn't uh he had no insight onto who these people were or what their community was and it was my impression that he had never done business with them before.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6262s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, Gerry, Gerry's the big guy. Gerry was... we'll see from documents like that Gerry had been working for the brethren and specifically from for Brad Mitchell since at least 2005\. So there's a long, long relationship with Brad Mitchell and the brethren and Gerald Chipeur. Um how Alan got mixed in, I mean, Alan's, you know, just a gopher for Gerry, I guess, in political things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6288s)

So like we have to remember too, if we go back into the political side of things, I mean, there's a video out there of all those prominent... Brad Mitchell on that front row when...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6298s)

It's Brad Mitchell sitting on the front row at Stephen Harper's inauguration ceremony along with four other prominent brethren members. Yeah, here's the video of that.

Okay, so finishing off this text message, Alan Hallman says, "I also need all correspondence and information you have in regard to these guys. Thanks." So Alan Hallman is is saying to David Wallace, "You've got to hand over all the messages, all the text messages, all the WhatsApp, all the emails you ever had for these guys so we can destroy this evidence." And David Wallace is replying, "All the material is mine. I don't give anything, I don't give away [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6366s) to anyone. I'm in possession of that and it's safe and will remain so. I'm tired of these people, all of them, and I told them to cease hacking and they didn't. I have the digital crack they used to get in and that's unacceptable. They were told not to fuck with me and they broke the rules. A pity." Next. So this is David refusing to hand over all the emails that, you know, eventually became the Klondike papers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6391s)

So what is this like, like reliving this?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6395s)

Uh in now, I mean, yeah, different compared to what it used to be. I mean, uh whole process has really changed everything. So I don't look at things as I used to. I mean, I don't look the same, I don't act the same. Uh I'm kind of discovering who I am. So looking back at this, it puts me into a very different mindset.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6417s)

And does it make you, do you sit back and you're like, "I can't even believe that that went down."

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6423s)

Oh yeah. I mean, I just, the truth is, I mean, if if I hadn't been involved in this particular case, things might not have changed for me. I'd probably be busy at work making a lot of money on the right side of the political...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6441s)

Yeah, because this was a turning point in your whole life, wasn't it? Like you became a whistleblower and out of becoming a whistleblower, I mean, they bled you dry, right? You finally did get back to back to Ontario, but I mean, it is it really changed your life, didn't it?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6458s)

Yeah, it destroyed everything. I've lost everything I own, uh all my savings. And it's important to understand that the only reason I was taking these sort of jobs when I got back into Canada, because I'd always for decades kept my work, what I do, completely separate from my personal life. When I was John Nada, as you see in those emails, a lot of times I would be working as John Nada in Eastern Europe or the United States or anywhere but Canada. I was only taking these political jobs in Canada because uh after the Russian invasion of the Ukraine in 2014 and um the subsequent uh freezing of assets and the problems with the private [bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6504s) in the Ukraine, I lost all my money. I had many millions of dollars that were on deposit. So I had lost all of my ill-gotten gains. So I was taking these jobs to try to put together a bit of a nest egg, you know, and that's the only reason I was doing business in Canada at all and it was the first time in my professional career that I had really used my own name on a job. So it led to a lot of problems. I mean, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6534s) wife, not least of, was very surprised to find out what I did for a living. Completely separate life.

She had no idea. Nobody knew. Nobody in my family knew what I did for a living. Wow. So it's kind of, now I'm David Wallace again, and I'm trying to figure out exactly who that is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6556s)

I think we're all on that journey.

David then received a text from Alan Hallman saying, "Hey, the brethren want your computer and we'll buy you another. What would you think of that? Thanks."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6574s)

Okay, so this is the next email that is coming up. This is what happened after I'd published the conversation. And David and I made contact and initially David was... And that's dated Thursday, July 29th. "Please take this down." But when he, you know, we had a conversation. I explained what the brethren were and he very generously decided to kind of wholeheartedly take my side in the [matter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6605s) And so this is, we've now got to, well, this is April. So this is a couple of months after this all went down. And this is like friendly conversation between me and David. And I'm just sending him some news that's just hit the fan. So this is from me to David Wallace. Subject, "PI scandal breaking news. Hey, this hit the fan in New Zealand today. Call me when you're free. Thanks, Richard." And then there's a link to a New Zealand news article. And [I'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6635s) just read this article because this... Oh, yeah, you've got to read this. Extremely relevant. And this went down literally within two months of the whole David Wallace Klondike paper scandal blowing up in Canada. This is what went down in New Zealand. So this is from Radio New Zealand;

‚ÄúA two-year investigation from Radio New Zealand has found the Exclusive Brethren Church, (that's the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church) is a major and secret [client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6665s) of controversial private investigators Thompson and Clark. A privacy law specialist believes the church's use of private detectives to spy on former members could potentially lay it open to charges of harassment. Investigative reporter Nicky Hager says the discredited private investigation company has dossiers on at least 20 former members of the Exclusive Brethren based on street surveillance, monitoring of social media, checks in public records and information [supplied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6695s) by church leaders. Professor Nicole Moreham from Victoria University told reporter Ruth Hill it could also have a damaging psychological effect on those being watched.‚Äù

And then this is another report, also April, a little later in April 20... oh sorry, this is April 2021 yeah, and this is Radio New Zealand;

 "Former Exclusive Brethren member wants charitable status stripped." A former member of the Exclusive Brethren in Britain is calling on the government to strip the church of its charitable status. Lance Christie, who was excluded from the church four years ago, was followed by private investigators during his visits to New Zealand and Australia [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6738s) confront church leaders about what he calls their destructive doctrine of separation. He told reporter Ruth Hill about the first time he knew he was followed. Doug Watt of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church says that "just like any church, we're sad if someone leaves us, but we wish them all the best in their lives and of course hope that one day they will change their mind." So this is Doug Watt, the spokesman for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And then this is the [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6768s) I really want to focus on. In a written statement, Watt said, "What our church or leadership does not do is launch secretive, clandestine, overnight operations with hired private investigators."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6783s)

No, they're political fixers. He's not actually lying. He wasn't a PI.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6790s)

He wasn't actually a PI.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6792s)

And I had never represented myself as one to them. I mean, it was, I was very clear in my emails.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6797s)

And then he goes on to say, "While we cannot comment on the actions of every individual within our church, it is certainly true to say that the church leadership has absolutely no knowledge of or involvement in the matters that you have described."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6814s)

Which we can go back to those emails when they talk about "Global." So Global is what's represented and that's what's referred to as the Hales, the Hales dynasty, right? Global is the Brethren's Global Advisory Panel, also known as GAP. It consists of members of Bruce Hales' family, plus the heads of key PBCC ecosystem branches such as UBT chief Caleb Hall, PPE profiteer John Anderson, and UBT accounting head Phil McNaughton. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6844s) Global Advisory Panel is the executive board of the cult. It meets in secret in the executive floor of the PBCC headquarters, The Precinct in Sydney, Australia. This is the location that was raided by the Australian Tax Office in March. This is the only known photo of Global assembled in The Precinct. The documents obtained from the Australian Securities and Investment Commissions or ASIC show the directors of GAAP are as follows. Document link attached in the description of [podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6874s)

Dean Hales from Sydney, Australia.

Cameron Hales from Sydney, Australia.

Mick Strange from Cleveland, USA.

Rod Diplock from San Francisco, USA.

Caleb Hall, Palmerston, North, New Zealand.

Jonathan Hubbard, Sydney, Australia.

John Rich, Guilford, United Kingdom.

Jim Hazel, London, United Kingdom.

Ewan Lloyd Turnside, Melbourne Australia.

 Brent Scott, Oxbow, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Logan Curry, Tarana, New Zealand.

Phil McNaughton, Sydney, Australia.

Greg Mason, Auckland, New Zealand.

I want to go back to something they said here too. Um but "just like any church, we're sad if someone leaves us." I want to just inform Doug Watt that no, other churches don't get sad when someone else goes to another church. It happens all the time. People can go to a Catholic church one day and go to a United church the next day. Nobody cries over it.

When the recording of David Wallace's phone call went public, the brethren flew into a blind panic. They had just spent tens of millions on a global PR campaign to rebrand themselves as a mainstream Christian church with an ethos of "compassion in action." They were about to be exposed as a brutal and thuggish Scientology-style cult. What to do? They chose the nuclear option. They hired Schillings. Who are Schillings? They are a famous and unique business who specialize in providing reputation management [services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=6998s) to billionaire A-list celebrities who have literally been caught with their pants down. They combine ferocious attack dog lawyers with military-grade private investigators, cyber security experts and PR spin doctors. They also are off the chart expensive.

 Check out this article where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hired Schillings over a highly embarrassing letter leaked by Meghan's dad. And the headline of the article says, "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle recruit attack dog lawyers used by the rich and famous in [lawsuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7028s) over Markle letter." And it goes on to say, "When the rich and famous want to silence their critics, it is to attack dog lawyer Schillings that they frequently turn. Media experts said choosing the aggressive London based Schillings was a risky move by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. One said it could be seen as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut." 

The Schillings legal team aimed to scrub the internet clean of any reference to the David Wallace scandal by firing off threatening letters to the social media giants Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7058s) Here is the letter that they sent to Twitter. So it says in the top right hand corner, "Schillings" and;

 "Private and Confidential, March 10th, 2021\. Most urgent, not for publication. Dear sir or madam, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, the PBCC. We act for the PBCC. One, we have been instructed to lodge this complaint to Twitter on behalf of our client." And then it's blanked out. "Number two, we write in relation to a Twitter account, which is currently publishing a defamatory allegation against our [client.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7088s) The posting questions are available at the following URLs."

Then it goes on to number three. "Taken together, the tweets would be understood to mean that our client has hired a private investigator for $10,000 a week to kidnap Mr. Richard Marsh, a former member of our client's church. The allegation is one of serious criminal conduct, is wholly untrue and defamatory of our client."

Number four, "We refer to the audio recording contained in a YouTube video which is linked to, in the fifth tweet, the audio recording. The audio recording is of a telephone conversation between a private investigator named David Wallace and an individual named Dr. Karat Singh. In the audio recording, Mr. Wallace claims to be receiving instructions to commit illegal acts from an individual named Brad Mitchell. Mr. Wallace does not at any stage in the audio recording state that he was hired by our client because he was not. Our client does not and has never [employed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7146s) Mr. Wallace and has no involvement in the events described by Mr. Wallace during the audio recording. Prior to the audio recording being brought to our client's attention via social media, it had no knowledge of Mr. Wallace or the events he describes. The allegation is therefore entirely false and defamatory."

 As proved by multiple emails and UBT Zoom calls, David Wallace was hired by Rod Diplock, Brad Mitchell and Mick Strange. Diplock and Strange are two of the four directors of the Plymouth Brethren [Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7176s) Church in the USA, and all three hold top positions in the UBT, the financial wing of the cult. Not only this, but the PBCC's Global Advisory Panel was requested and received an urgent update during the process, but in the Schillings Letter, they claimed that, "prior to the audio recording being brought to their client's attention, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church had no knowledge of Mr. Wallace or the events he describes." The Schillings letter finishes as follows;

 Requirement number nine, "[In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7206s) light of the above, our client requests your confirmation that you will terminate the account as a matter of urgency." 

Number ten, "We trust that given the seriousness of the allegation made against our client, that this request will be dealt with as a matter of urgency and in any event, no later than midday, Thursday the 11th, March 2021\. We reserve all of our client's rights, yours faithfully, Schillings." 

Richard wrote to Schillings telling them that their client was lying to them and enclosed the evidence. No further Schillings attack occurred and the [scandal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7236s) along with the Klondike Papers proceeded to go viral. Schillings' prestigious client list includes Diana, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, J.K. Rowling and Sir Paul McCartney. They can now proudly add Brad Mitchell and Rod Diplock to the list.

A few months later, David Wallace handed over his entire archive of communication to Richard to index and publish as he saw fit. Out of over 15,000 pages of emails, documents, text, videos and audio recordings, Richard condensed 3,500 pages that were of public interest. This compilation was named the Klondike Papers, after Brad Mitchell's business, Klondike Lubricants. As so often happens, the Brethren's efforts to silence a critic and cover a scandal backfired [spectacularly,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7284s) leading to a massive exposure of Brethren corruption, far more devastating than their original crimes they sought to hide. The Klondike Papers opened the floodgates.

The Klondike Papers were distributed to a select handful of Canadian journalists, resulting in the publication of numerous articles that caused severe embarrassment to several leading Canadian right-wing political figures, including Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, Pierre Poilievre, Leader of the Conservative Party and Jonathan Denis, former Attorney General of Alberta. The Klondike Papers are even in Wikipedia under the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church now. In particular, Emily Leedham of Press Progress [deserves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7326s) special mention for an excellent series of articles unraveling the extensive corrupting political influence of the Brethren in both Canada and the USA.

Fearless podcaster James DiFiore of Blackballed contacted Richard when he saw these articles and in a series of interviews with Richard and others produced podcasts exposing the rampant sexual abuse in the PBCC and the persecution of former members. The Blackballed podcast caught the attention of Jesse Brown of Canadaland who produced their own award-winning podcast series about the Klondike Papers called Ratfucker. Documentary producer Alex McIntosh of City TV also saw the Klondike [Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7368s) articles and worked with Richard and other former Brethren members to produce the Breaking Brethren documentary broadcast on Canadian TV in the spring of 2022\. Inspired by the Breaking Brethren documentary is where I came forward with my heartbreaking story of child abuse, trafficking, and torture at the hands of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church elders in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. And I went to the police and filed a report that took two days and nine hours to do. This in turn led to the creation of the Get A Life podcast, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7398s) most devastating expose of the Brethren ever published.

The Klondike Papers went viral on social media. Here are some of the clips.

### [**Klondike Papers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7424s)

So the Klondike papers. The average person has no idea about this church. So if it does come out that that church has been pulling strings, which have, you know, resulted in a lot of the things that have happened in the last few years, that wasn't known by the people who followed any of these movements. They were victims of misinformation. And I think everyone, whether you're a Convoy supporter or not, whether you're on the right or left, most average people do not want anything like evangelical, Christian, sect, controlling anything. So all of your favourite conservative homeboys, Poilievre, Bergen, Ford, [Harper,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7473s) they were all implicated in the Klondike papers. And I'm sure there's going to be more.

### [**Ryan Jespersen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7480s)

... surveil and track this ex-member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church checks out. You know, I've spoken to the ex-member in question, I've looked at these documents, I've looked at the church's tactics elsewhere, and everything follows.

### [**Klondike Papers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7496s)

Can I just say that I love you and I've been thinking about it all day?

Hey everybody. So I'm hoping more and more Canadians have been reading up on the Klondike papers.

From what I've read so far, it's quite terrifying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7518s)

Okay, so it's time to go over some frequently asked questions when it comes to the Klondike papers. And I'm here to answer some questions that I see a lot coming up in the comments to the best of my ability.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7528s)

The Klondike Papers are thousands of emails, texts, documents that reveal corruption and otherwise very shady behavior regarding the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and a bunch of Canadian conservative politicians.

### [**Klondike Papers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7544s)

So the Klondike Papers, for those who don't know, are a bunch of papers that were leaked that shows ties between the Plymouth Brethren Christian cult and the Conservative Party and the UPC Party of Canada.

### **Richard Marsh**

Okay, part three, let's dive into it. It has been an absolutely intense 24 to 48 hours when it comes to the Klondike Papers, and I hopefully will have some really exciting things to announce soon, but for now, let's talk about... Okay, so if you're a Canadian and you care a little bit about Canadian politics, you should probably start paying attention to this story. The story being the Klondike papers. The Klondike papers is a complicated group of documents, 6,400 documents. I think about the Klondike papers.

### [**Klondike Papers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7590s)

My immediate gut reaction is, oh my gosh, I always knew this was true and I'm so thrilled somebody's finally talking about it. And this all comes from a Klondike papers, which is a leak by David Wallace, who is a political fixer for the conservatives. I refused to originally talk about this because I had no way to validate it, but Canada did a deep dive and a series on it. You need to look up the Klondike papers. You need to look up Stephen Harper, you need to look up Plymouth Brethren Church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7614s)

The Klondike papers, my final thoughts.

Just starting to delve into these Klondike papers and Mind blown.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7626s)

And honestly, I just want to be like, "Told you so, told you so."

To the insiders, these are not attacks on the brethren like Bruce is telling you. None of this is your fault. We are trying to help you see through what you are inside. You are in a cult, and as hard as that is to hear, you can get out. Bruce Hales and his team are using you. He is the devil's pawn, and you are playing right into it. This podcast is full of concrete, foolproof receipts of the evil and corruption they have their hands in. Please, find your courage to walk away. You deserve [more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7663s) Bruce himself has used the word "mafia" before in UBT seminars. Ben Woodbury had a death threat from someone high up that used the same word. You need to realize you are just pawns in their game. This is not a mainstream Christian church and it will fall. Leave now before it gets any messier. And ask yourself honestly, how much was covered up just in this one podcast? How many lies were proven just in here? The ex-members are not out to oppose this cult. We want our families out of harm's way. [What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7693s) will happen if you're the next one in one of those drunken accidents? I have one question for you. What is the one thing you can do today to prepare to leave?

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7703s)

It's a criminal organization.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7705s)

Right down to the kind of family type leadership. It's very much like the godfather and his sons.

The second lieutenants in the whole thing are always the sons of the godfather. And everyone else is held in fear and terror of those. And that's the royal family.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7720s)

I plead with my siblings and my parents and my family to get out while you can. This system's going to go down and you don't want to be caught in it. Get your businesses separated from UBT. It is such an evil criminal system that is being exposed on every level. If you have the opportunity to get out, get out now.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7747s)

Yep, and it's it's it's inevitable. The the process has already started, the legal process, the bad press, the the will of governments around the world have turned against the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and from this point forward, it'll be a slow but steady inevitable decline. You'll see criminal prosecutions, you'll see more survivors of sexual abuse that will come forward. The death spiral has begun and and it will not [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7777s) reversed. Uh the the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I I don't think that they'll be around in any form or fashion in 20 years. I really don't. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jODDGSPVGh4&t=7786s)

I agree. I want to thank you both for walking through what seems to be just like the tip of this iceberg. So we'll definitely continue this saga.
