## Summary

TRIGGER WARNING! This podcast contains discussions on physical abuse, sexual abuse, and suicide. Viewer discretion is advised.
Isaac's story originates in New Zealand with an abusive father that he couldn't escape from. In this inspiring story, Isaac shares what it was like growing up in the PBCC, where he not only suffered physical abuse but also sexual abuse. He describes his journey with the priests and how he was confined to a tiny apartment for over a year. The biggest takeaway from this harrowing story is the way Isaac found a way to stand back up and create an incredible life for himself. His messages to others in a predicament like he was and to the insiders will have you in tears with his bravery and heartfelt plea to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. What would life have been like had the PBCC taught sex education and consent? What could have been prevented had there been anger management classes for his father and accountability? How do priests get away with heartless treatment and confinement? This is a story that would sure spark some change inside the PBCC if they were listening to the pain of each and every survivor that comes forward. Part 1 of Isaac's story is just the lead up to a letter to Bruce Hales in Part 2. Stay tuned!

Trigger warning. Discussion on physical abuse, sexual abuse, and suicide. Your discretion is advised.

Welcome back everyone. If this is your first time joining us, I am Cheryl, an ex-member from Maple Creek Saskatchewan, and I escaped the Exclusive Brethren sect when I was 17\. It is now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Today joining me is Cassandra from Australia and Lindy from New Zealand, who are also both ex-members of the PBCC. So welcome ladies.

We have a very special guest today, Isaac Foster, that is originally from New Zealand, and he is here to tell his journey of leaving the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and how he was able to create an incredible life for himself after leaving. Welcome, Isaac, and thank you so much for joining us.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=151s)

Thanks so much, Cheryl. Thanks for having me on.

I'm kind of excited to be here, a little bit nervous as well, because I've actually never done this before.

Never actually really shared my story in its entirety.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=168s)

That's awesome. I think these success stories are so important and we are super excited to hear yours. I'm going to hand it over to you now if you want to give us a glimpse into what made you leave the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And I also know that insiders will be excited to hear how you left and if you have any tips for them from your experiences. And then we all want to hear about the adventurous life that you have built for yourself. So take it away.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=193s)

Thank you.

So this is kind of like a lengthy story, so bear with me. But to start off with, I'd like to preface it that what I'm about to share is a difficult and very unpleasant story to listen to. However, if you if you bear with me, it does have a very happy ending. And that's why I'm here and what I really want to focus on. Um, no matter what your past is, no matter what you have or had to [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=225s) or currently enduring, like your future is absolutely not written yet. Um, and on many occasions on my like on my kind of my time in the PBCC, like I personally like lost all hope even sort of like for like a half-hearted existence and yet like right now I'm living the kind of life I used to believe was imaginary. I think I think it was Theocritus [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=255s) Greek poet, he was famed for saying where there is life there is hope. And so like to those of you who are watching and listening who also feel stuck in impossible situations, first of all, thank you so much for taking the time to hear my story. But more importantly, if you have lost hope, please, like I beg you, please keep going because it's my hope that this story will [hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=285s) demonstrate that no matter how insurmountable you believe your situation is, there is an unimaginable amount of good in store for you. And I think the first real step of that is asking for help, asking for assistance, and there is absolutely assistance out there for you. I think Lindy's website is a really good place to start. Absolutely.

Yeah, so that said, I'll get straight into it. I was born and raised in a little town, little country town called Kaitaia, top of the North Island in New Zealand. Very large family, 12 children. We were quite poor, but we managed to have lots of fun with it. I had largely had a really lovely fun, well, it wasn't, let's just backtrack. It wasn't lovely but there were times, there was like pockets, it's like really great [moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=347s) and most of those were spent with my siblings and my mother. We had a very loving and caring and selfless mother who was so devoted, well as devoted as she could be, to myself and my siblings.

My siblings were amazing. They, you know, some were more indoctrinated than others, but like for the large part, they were very easy to get along with and lots of fun to be around.

Unfortunately, we had to navigate an especially violent, raging father.

Oddly enough, he wasn't an alcoholic, which is quite common in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Um, in fact, he actually barely drank a drop, um, and when he did, he would water it down with lemonade.

Each to their own. Um, he was he was just simply an aggressive and volatile individual. He was unfortunately just ruled by his, um, impulsive selfishness. Um, my earliest memory of him was myself hiding under the dinner table while he beat one of my sisters with a belt to the point where she fell to the ground.

His anger didn't really have any boundaries.

When we were children, he would beat our autistic brother, he would lock us under the house which was like a 30 centimeter like high sort of like little pocket that you could kind of shove a child or a lawnmower underneath. We were severely beaten for most weeks.

I can't remember, for as early as I can possibly remember, really.

We were beaten with tools, pieces of wood, unopened bottles of soft drink. I can remember one occasion, my brother and I were having a little sibling tiff, and he came out with an unopened bottle of lemonade, I think it was, yeah, it was lemonade, and he hit my brother and then hit myself, and he hit me so hard that it popped and I was like covered in lemonade. And the reason why I'm kind of smiling when I say that is because the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=491s) thought through my head was, finally, a drink of lemonade.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=498s)

Isaac, can I interrupt there? Thanks for sharing this stuff. That's super painful, but I'm curious about, I love asking people this question, what number in the siblings were you? You know, you're there, 12 were you? Yeah, because it can impact your experiences, whether you were like, you know, the oldest or the youngest or you like bang in the middle.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=520s)

Yeah, absolutely. I was number 10.I had two younger brothers after me, 11 and 12, obviously. And I was kind of like raised by my older siblings as well as my mother.And so, yeah, I mean, I think even the older siblings experienced his wrath. Like it wasn't, I guess, I mean, he had his favorites. He had his favorites and his punching bags.

And but but the older siblings also experienced his violent rages. It kind of like at least, you know, all of us received some sort of beating at some point from him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=568s)

Was this common knowledge in the Brethren that he was like this and that you guys were being beaten like this?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=576s)

Yes. Yes. I remember my mother at one stage, she would hide with me in the family bathroom and lock the door. And he would like throw his weight against the door. And at one point she was so terrified. She called my older brother who came and sort of tried to calm him down.

It sort of didn't work for a little bit. But then and then and then somehow like he just sort of like calmed. And honestly, don't know how that door held. It was it was like barely, you know, like a thin sheet of plywood. Yet, yeah, it did hold. Um, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=620s)

Those are absolutely, yeah, it's it's, I'm so sorry to hear this, Isaac. Like those are those are absolutely traumatizing and terrifying experiences for any person, no matter age, but especially a child that's so helpless. Yeah, that's really hard. Um, yeah, for for just for the listener, if they don't know me, I grew up in Auckland and met Isaac's family when they were a bit older and moved near to Auckland. Um, so yeah, I do remember your dad. I remember meeting obviously your mom and [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=650s) dad and um and some of your siblings. And you've mentioned your autistic brother, who was, he was the next one above you, hey, in age?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=657s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=657s)

And um, like yeah, lovely guy, but like, yeah, quite severely autistic, right? So that would have been incredibly confusing and hard for him to be living with all those dynamics as well. And yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there are dysfunctional and abusive parents everywhere, but I think when they're inside a high control group like the Brethren, there's even less kind of access for support and help. And you know, like Cheryl's question, you know, did the wider [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=687s) know? Like, I'm sure they would have known in in some ways, because um, no secrets are kept day within a community like that, like everybody gossips. Um, and yeah, but it's like, yeah, did any leaders or elders like try and stop that or like step in and help or kind of, you know, was your dad a bit of a law unto himself kind of thing?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=710s)

Yeah, I mean, there was a few people that like that obviously, you know, throughout my period of my time in there, there was a few people that talked to him and was like, you need to like back off, like you need to stop, um, beating your children. Um, this isn't acceptable. Even I actually credit, um, believe it or not, Daniel Hales, like had a very stern word with him. Um, and he would change, he would change for like a couple of weeks, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=740s) then he would just like just revert back to, yeah. Um, so there were multiple people that did actually like did try. None of the actual leaders that I'm aware of, apart from apart from, um, Daniel, um, had a word with them, but it would just be the odd like hearing...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=761s)

Blogs from among the community. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, that's super like that's super devastating and disappointing. But I'm also not surprised because I think so often the leaders of these Brethren communities are actually completely ill-equipped to deal with, um, yeah, major dysfunction or abuse that is going on in families. They've got no clue and they've often got like very limited compassion or empathy as well or people skills, actually, you know, they've [become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=791s) leaders just because they were like wealthy or ambitious rather than actually because they had genuine leadership or emotional or people skill. So like I'm not I'm not surprised that the leaders in Kaitaia or in Pukekohe or whatever like didn't actually help you guys, but that's super, yeah, they like they've let you down as well. Your community let you down as well as your dad letting you down. That's awful.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=813s)

Lindy, there's also the the aspect of they won't go to authorities because it's a slight on the testimony. So that's the really sad part is that even though clearly he wasn't changing long term or he wasn't listening long term, um, there was never, there would never have been the thought to go to authorities and actually have him, you know, dealt with in the proper authority.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=842s)

Um, that's so true. That's so true. Like probably Isaac, your mum was never encouraged to talk to her doc, yeah, to reach out to social services or I mean, your dad should have been completely being sent to secular anger management courses and family abuse courses and stuff. But probably, yeah, there is that mentality, Cassie, of like, no, we don't reach out outside of our community for help because it's a shame on the testimony. And so yeah, really, your family, Isaac, probably people just were turning a major [blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=873s) eye over and over and over again for years as to what was going on.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=877s)

And a lot of the thing, I think I think it was it was a lot of the time it was like placed in the too hard basket because that wasn't the only thing that was happening with our family, um, which obviously I'll I'll I'll get into. Um, I actually, I stopped, I don't know if this is, um, helpful to mention anybody out there listening, but I stopped crying when I was seven, um, during his beatings. Not because I wished to give him any kind of like [satisfaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=907s) or some sort of like effort to be tough, but because I was so used to the violence at that stage. And I think that has really affected my life going forward because like whenever something really horrific happens, um, I don't show any emotion. Um, not that I am hard or like I'm stoic, you know, I'm a man, uh, no, no, none of that. It's just like I physically can't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=943s)

Yeah, it would be a trauma response.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=945s)

Absolutely. Yeah. Like I would like to, like I would love to be able to cry. Like crying is a relief a lot of the time, but I just literally can't. Um, it's very, very rare that I cry and usually it's at the 11th hour.

Yeah, so moving on, as this was happening, I then started being sexually abused from the age of six.

I didn't understand what was happening to me, obviously, being so young and also due to there being no teachings on sexual abuse in the PBCC. I was very confused as to what was happening to me. I somehow knew at that age that it was a shameful secret, and I don't believe that the woman who was abusing me was truly aware of the crime that she was committing. And looking back now, I know that she was being sexually assaulted as well, maybe before, but definitely during she was doing it to me and possibly after as well.

I know this because we were once out for dinner at her place one evening and I walked in on it happening and she asked me not to leave until this man had left her alone. Just a quick side note on that.

I want to be clear that I'm not obviously trying to excuse her behavior with explaining that. I just want to simply point out that this could have been prevented if the PBCC wasn't built on hiding truth, if they didn't silence those being assaulted, if they actually taught sex education and the age of consent. All of this neglect, like coupled with their disdain for law enforcement provided, and I guess would probably still provide to this day, the perfect breeding ground for abusers and abuse not only to flourish but to kind of go wholly undetected. Even as we speak, I don't believe that my family are truly aware of what happened to me as a child during this [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1082s). My father, he got withdrawn from, essentially kicked out of the church for infidelity. I again was too young to know what really was going on, but I can remember the relief of the knowledge that I was going to be sent away from him and I was going to sent away from, well, you know, the other abuse as [well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1112s)

I was sent down to live with my sister in Hastings, her and her husband, and for the first time I experienced like, first time I experienced real friendship. I made some friends down there who were just incredible.

Um, they were just beautiful people. Um, I got on really well with one particular lad and we got up to all things like, you know, what children are expected to get up to. Um, that was so healing and, um, hopefully if he's listening, um, like Luke and Jerry Currie, they are just spectacular, them and their family. Um, I just were just beautiful people and they would like continue to be that way until the day that I left.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1163s)

I'm going to jump in there for a minute because when I think about you, Isaac, like the word fun is totally like one of the top three words that I would use to describe you. You're like a really, you know, I haven't had to do with you for years now, but like my memories of you are that you are so much fun and has such a great sense of humour. Like hearing more about how traumatic your home environment was and yeah, how, you know, some of the severe abuse you've had and stuff, like I'm I'm amazed at, um, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1193s), that definitely, you know, even in your teenage years, but I bet it's still the same now, that fun and humor and playfulness are things that characterize you. So, but yeah, I'm wondering if like your time in Hastings maybe where like some of that was allowed to flourish and you were allowed to like play and be a kid and and yeah, be safe and have fun. Like maybe that's where some of that that was allowed to grow in you.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1219s)

Yeah, I mean, it was definitely, it was such, so, so, so helpful. And it kind of like showed me for the first time, like what family life like should look like and what a life of a child like should really be. It was, I think like you're actually demonstrating now, it was a lot more, probably a lot more meaningful that I'm probably giving it credit for.

I've also found like humor to be like such a reprieve from kind of like from disorder and dysfunction and pain and hardship. Like if I can like have a wee giggle, even if it's like wildly inappropriate, it sort of just alleviates some of that like stress and that trauma from taking hold.

Yeah, and that our whole family was like that. Like we would always like when something awful would happen, we'd always look at each other and be like, so when can we laugh? Like, is it appropriate to laugh now? I know it's just happened, but like, is it appropriate to make fun of it? And then, I mean, yes, like in some cases, inappropriate, it still was so helpful, that element. So yeah, thanks for pointing that out, [Lindy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1302s) Yeah.

So nine months later, my dad was brought back into the PBCC and I was required to return home to, unfortunately, more violence from him and further sexual abuse. And one thing I've experienced from my time in the PBCC, that if your family is poor or odd or maybe going through some difficult period, then bullying usually follows.

It is a horrible irony that the PBCC leaders peddle this idea that they're a supportive community. However, the reality is that when you're really in need of help, you are kicked instead of down. And sometimes literally. Sometimes.

It's wild. It's wild.

I mean, as a result of this, like, kind of like levels of torment.

I can imagine I became a very confused and angry child and it's like, as like, nowhere was, nowhere was safe for me or my brothers.My anger helped in one area, as I can remember telling the woman who was abusing me to leave me alone or else I'd dob on her.

She stopped after I threatened, but then she began mistreating me in other ways, taking any kind of opportunity to lie about what I was getting up to in order to get me in trouble.I guess this was like a tactic to discredit me. Like looking back now, I guess this was a tactic to discredit me if I ever broke my silence. And it somewhat worked too.

I sort of became like a black sheep, if you will. It's a very dramatic term, but there we go.

And I began getting into fights at school after the PBCC churches meetings. Mostly those fights were just to defend myself and my brothers from the violence I was experiencing there.

And I was getting into fights at home as well, both with my siblings and my dad.

While all of this was happening, I can also remember begging my mum to leave the PBCC as I didn't know why it was the cause of my problems. I just knew that it was. I wasn't aware of, like, obviously the systemic issues and the historical issues that were kind of like filtering down and affecting my life as it was. I just knew that it was the architect of all of my troubles. We then moved down to a little town south of Auckland for my brother Rod, the one with autism, to get a proper education. At this stage, I started to defend myself and my [brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1479s) from my dad's beatings.

He then changed tactics and would wait until I was asleep to give me a thrashing. So he'd come in my room once I was sleeping and he would beat me while I was sleeping. This happened quite regularly between the ages of um, 13 and 14\. I realized that the PBCC was somehow like just wrong on every level. Um, I was very inquisitive, like curious child and none of my questions being [answered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1514s) truthfully but being avoided, um, or I was just being simply shut down with, you know, like your regular, don't fight it, just accept it, you know, it's your birthright, all that nonsense. Um, and to anyone like listening who is still a part of like a high demand religious group, um, I just want to point out something that sort of like came to me, it's something I think I've read probably, um, it sort of like came to me as I was like, you know, [typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1544s) out my notes, that anything good and right will remain standing no matter what kind of scrutiny it comes under.

Therefore, if the PBCC is indeed like the perfect place as the leaders enjoy telling everyone, then it should welcome that a level of questioning or any level of questioning really. Just just a little food for thought.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1567s)

This, that's, I just want to pause just there. Like that is such a important statement that you just made. That is absolutely, if it really has the foundation that they believe it does, then it should 100 percent withstand everything everybody is throwing their way.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1585s)

Yeah, and why why wouldn't you encourage questions if you've got all the answers? Why wouldn't you encourage people to ask questions?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1594s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we can all attest to them being wholly unaccepting to any kind of scrutiny. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I began to rebel as any normal teenager would do, but also within a high-demand religious group and also question the [leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1624s) in my area.

In fact, at that stage, I had a massive problem with authority due to all authoritative figures in my life at the time, either assaulting me or proving themselves to be completely untrustworthy. I started to be very vocal about the obvious lies. I would brutally say what I thought about the more useless and bullshit-centric church sessions, which was fun and somehow satisfying, but would inevitably cause more problems, both for myself and my family.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1655s)

What age were you when you moved to Pukekohe?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1658s)

I was 13\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1661s)

Okay, 13\. So that was when the Brethren were pulling all the kids out of the high schools and stuff, right? And starting them at the Brethren-only school. It must have been exactly around that age. Did you go to a non-Brethren primary and then you went to Westmount when you were 13?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1681s)

Yes, exactly. So I went to a non-Brethren primary and I went to a non-Brethren middle school. And then I was one of the first students to go to their private school. It started off in Pukekohe and then obviously when I was in year 12, we merged with Westmount and then that's when I started going to...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1706s)

Right, which was in Auckland. So, okay, so, right, so in your middle kind of teen years to the end of your schooling, you were then, you along with the other kids from Pukekohe, like it's like, what, half an hour, an hour out of Auckland, you guys would be put on the bus and brought into the Auckland campus every day, which is quite full on, like quite a long bus trip. And yeah, that would have had its own challenges. You guys were naughty on the bus, weren't you?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1731s)

We were, yeah, we were, we were cheeky sods, the whole bloody lot of us. I, um, and I I can remember those bus trips being quite fun. Like, um, we would, you know, we would like just use them as time to like catch up with our friends. Um, yeah, so no, I'm pretty...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1750s)

Sure I remember like bus drivers going through bus drivers like toilet paper, like they they didn't really like the Brethren kids on this. Yeah, there's quite a bit of vandalism and like, yeah.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1761s)

That is not surprising. I mean, I probably would have had been like the perpetrator on many occasions for those poor bus drivers quitting. Um, and if you're you're out there listening, I apologize. Um, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1778s)

Now they can listen to this and understand why you why you were acting out, right? Yeah.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1782s)

It's probably the only only place that you were relatively unsupervised, essentially. Like the bus driver was driving, he couldn't really do anything. You were all together with your peers and you were, it was the only time you could probably act out where you wouldn't immediately be disciplined or pulled into line, if you know what I mean. There was a there was a time period you knew that you had to [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1812s) of act out and then the consequences might come later, but in the moment it was like your free, your free safe place.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1820s)

Yes, exactly. And that's a really good point, Cassie. That's a really, really good point. I think like a lot of us have experienced that as well. Like, can you remember getting like a like a smidge of freedom and then just like taking it to the nth degree? It's like, just just using, um, every little last little drop that they give you. Um, um, yeah, no, like that's a really, really good point. Yeah, not that that excuses my behavior in any [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1850s). No, that absolutely doesn't. Um, but yeah, that's a very good point. It's a very good point.

Yeah, um, so you might be...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1859s)

Going to talk about this, so ignore this if you are, but what was schooling in the Brethren school like for you? You know, like from again, from what I know of you, you're a phenomenally creative person. Um, you know, you're, yeah, you're intelligent, you're creative, you're you're incredibly good at, you were incredibly good at drama and dance and, um, yeah, and creative things. And like all those things are not not areas that the Brethren allow and, um, like [allow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1890s) to flourish or encourage to flourish. I think plays, they were allowed every now and then, but I think they're banned at the moment and they've been banned for years. So doing things like drama and dance, expressly forbidden, and even more so for a man. Like, what was school like for you?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1908s)

I think like the first three years of high school were like horrible in the like Pukekohe sort of education, not because of my teachers, not because of the students, but because of the way it was set up. Um, we would be given a booklet, you know, like from I think like some sort of kind of like correspondence school and we would just like work through the booklet during the day and then like at lunchtime we'd have lunch and then in the afternoon we'd do exactly the same [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=1938s). And I was bored out of my mind. Um, there was like I really personally appreciate, like interaction with teachers and professors. I like sitting down and questioning them and asking, picking their brains, basically. Having someone in the room with that level of knowledge should be utilized.

And so I was just bored out of my mind, really. I can remember the first three years were just boring, really. And I think the Westmount School was like, although obviously it wasn't perfect, and there was obviously a lot of problems.

Having a more sort of like normal school structure was helpful and I ended up doing like the best, like when it comes to marks, I ended up doing the very best at the Westmount School just because of the way it was set out. Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2004s)

Because in Pukekohe, it would have been, yes, again, for the listener who's not familiar, the Brethren, yeah, as Isaac said, did make make students do kind of a form of homeschooling or correspondence for, yeah, it was a period of a few years. And so the kids would maybe get together like one day a week or a couple of days a week to work out of someone's house or a garage type room where some desks have been thrown in. But we're talking tiny groups of people, right? Like in Pukekohe, there would have been 10 or 15 students or something at that time, or even if that. So yeah, very small, very [boring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2034s), very, yeah, correspondence orientated.

 But um, not even like correspondence has often been set up for like somebody living on a farm rurally with an engaged parent to help them through it or that kind of thing, whereas this is really ad hoc and weird, wasn't it? So, um, yeah, so you're saying that when you actually then went to the the campus that had been freshly built in Auckland and that there was was real teachers there every day and a structure to the day and working through things with a [slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2064s) bigger class because it was students from Thames, Pukekohe and Auckland. So, I mean, I'm a similar age to you, right? We were a similar year. So there were probably as many as 20 kids in our class or not that many.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2075s)

Yeah, at least 20, I think. I mean, I... Yeah, so it was...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2080s)

A little bit bigger, a little bit more, as you said, teacher engagement. We had several different teachers and yeah, okay. So you're saying you thrived a bit better in that environment but still completely different to schools out here, right? Like again, we were not allowed to do any any sport. Like we could kick a ball around on the field, but no boys or girls playing together and no like organized sport, no absolutely no inter-school engagement or competition, no no music, no dance, drama, um, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2110s) a bunch of subjects were out of bounds. So still very limited education and opportunities.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2114s)

Yeah, yes. Unfortunately. I think like, I mean, there's a school that's just north of me and I know this is a Perth school, so it's like obviously like a very Perth northern suburb school, so it's kind of a very rich school, but they have a cycling team, which is just wild to me.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2137s)

This is not a Brethren school.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2137s)

This is not a Brethren school, yeah. This is just a regular school. Um, and so, um, like yeah, just thinking about what I'm like now, um, I I think I would have really thrived in that kind of environment with there's just so many different way areas in which you, um, you can excel at. You know, it's not just one area.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2163s)

Yeah, the PBCC schooling system really deprives the kids of so many opportunities.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2171s)

Yeah, and there's a grief process to that too, because when you realise what you've been deprived of, there's a grieving for that, because you go through this process like what I could have been, right, the things I could have done. And yes, we've still got time, you can still do things, but you know, age is not now on our side, you know, we've had to survive, we had to leave and build ourselves a life, and that that prime time of our [lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2202s) was taken from us where you know, you just you have to go through a grieving process of all the things that you you may have been able to do had you been afforded the opportunity.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2215s)

So true.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2215s)

And when you're in those those younger years too, right? Like to be able to go and experiment and try out this and try out that, that's when, you know, what we don't know what we would have liked back then, right? Because who we are now is so different than who we were back then. And I often have been thinking about this lately with so much going on with OneSchool Global and it takes you back into your own life. I went in, I was in a public school, but again, the same thing. You had to sit back when people were doing dramas. You had to [sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2245s) back when they were doing certain sports. You had to sit back. There's all those things where you were like, I might have liked that, you know? And because we're such a different person now in our adulthood, especially going through the trauma that we've gone through, like we just don't know. And so those are big opportunities, exactly, that you grieve when you finally realize that opportunity was taken away from you. And I really, really do think that this is, I'm hoping that out of this OneSchool Global, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2275s), investigation that's going on right now that there's certain things that are certain laws that are laid down for these children because they need them.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2287s)

Yeah. Yeah, 100%. It's kind of terrifying to know that they don't really have any access to the outside world anymore. I sort of feel quite lucky that at least I had the knowledge that there's something not right in my community. And I think that's sort of like the early years of schooling really helped with [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2317s) Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2319s)

They have nothing to compare it to right now. And that's what's really sad.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2323s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so I can't remember exactly what year it was, but like, um, it was sort of kind of around the time, going back a little bit, like when I was sort of really pushing the boundaries, uh, John Hales, leader of the PBCC at the time, died, and his son, Bruce Hales, took over.

And the same year that this happened, a movie came out called Bruce Almighty, much to my amusement. It turned out to be about a guy who was given some godlike powers. So I immediately nicknamed Bruce Hales, Bruce Almighty. And on the occasion, and I'm sure a lot of other people like made the connection as well, on the occasion when I was feeling brave or extra extra brave or intoxicated, I'd call him that fat [bastard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2376s). And that caused so many issues for my parents, for my siblings. And I think it was kind of like this again, it was like my own little way of like pushing the boundaries and like seeing how far I could I could shove that envelope. And I think I was spurred on by the fact that like even other people didn't respect him to the level they possibly do now, given that he wasn't like so [substantiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2406s) at that stage.

So was this when...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2409s)

He was first coming into power, right? Like would have that been early 2000s?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2414s)

Yes, yes, yeah, it would have been, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2417s)

Because there was a bit of unrest in the Brethren around, yeah, some people respected him, but nowhere near the way they do now.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2425s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. And through this rebellious stage, I started noticing like this, like a number of things that I felt were just just not on and like very problematic. I would listen as the members would make up rumors in real time while talking after church or during social gatherings, particularly at social lunches, almost always when alcohol was involved. I can [remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2455s) wondering why we were all so concerned about other people's lives. And yes, obviously gossip is fun, um, but why was it the cornerstone of almost all conversations in there? And it always made me uncomfortable because I knew that like gossip was why I was so unlike myself and my family were so, um, bullied and quite like so horrendously bullied.

 And there'd be times where [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2485s) would hear a story and I'd call the person the story was about and say, just a heads up, like this is what's being circulated and I know that this isn't true, um, but just be forewarned. And it was kind of almost like again, it was sort of part of that sort of rebellion, sort of like, like, I'm going to do, like, they're going to go that way, and I'm going to go that way. And not out of any kind of, like, moral obligation, but because if I'm stuck in this awful place, then I'm going to have my fun with it, goddammit.

Sort of, like, again, around the 13, 14 year mark, I realized I was gay.

A real one-two punch that one.

Oh, dear. Anyway, I obviously immediately tried to hide it.

It just presented itself. You know, obviously in puberty when those changes are coming and you start feeling affection towards one sex or the other, or both in some cases.

There was just moments in which that sort of presented itself. Um, I think one lad brought like a porn mag to school and I saw it and I was like, okay, um, I don't know why they're so obsessed with this. This is like nasty. Um, like, respect, but like, no thank you. Um, again, you go that way, I'll go that way.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2588s)

Yeah, so you noticed that you would do, like your feelings towards that were different to what they were expressing kind of thing?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2595s)

It's 100%. Um, and I think like if I look back, even like before then, I I'd sort of developed these crushes on men who are like kind and good and decent, but they weren't just, they weren't simply just uh, respect. They were respect, but also like there was like a romantic, like romanticizing of that. I never had that with girls. Like I respected women and like women were like my friends, but that's where it [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2625s) started to stop. It was very platonic for me. Yeah. And I googled it. I went to the library and googled it and found like a name for it. And then I just like shoved it, obviously, after that. I kind of like, I shoved it to the the recesses of my brain so this cannot and not take hold.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2645s)

I'm sure, like, the surroundings would have been telling you that it was so forbidden and wrong, right?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2653s)

Oh, 100%. Like, I was aware, obviously painfully aware at that stage, that all kinds or points of difference in the PBCC were unacceptable and would always attract unwanted and adverse scrutiny. Yeah. Yeah. So I just tried to get on with life, really. I did the obvious. I prayed a lot, prayed the gay away. Nothing really worked. So I just kind of gave up and hoped at some stage it would just piss off. Plot [twist,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2683s) it didn't.

Still here. Dang it. I was unfortunately then sexually assaulted again at 14 by a man in the PBCC while I was heavily intoxicated. He would have been in his mid-20s at the time. Um, I was so drunk that I couldn't really remember much of the assault, um, but the next morning I'd realized what had happened.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2710s)

And how old were you?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2710s)

I was 14\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2714s)

And was drinking at that age, I mean, we know this answer, but for our viewers and listeners, was drinking at that age of 14 acceptable?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2723s)

Oh, 100%. Like I started drinking at 13 and then very quickly moved from beer to spirits, um, and then from spirits to almost pure alcohol. Like honestly, sometimes I I I would literally smell flammable, I was so intoxicated. Um, and this was at 14 and 15, you know.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2747s)

And that would be at social occasions and stuff, drink would be freely available for people under 18\. And even though, yeah, you've said that your dad didn't drink much, but um, even if a parent didn't drink much, it was always expected that alcohol would be available in the house for guests and visitors, right? So I guess it was also available in your home?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2768s)

Yes, it was. Um, where there's one thing our parents were pretty good with, both my mom and my dad would lament over and over again to stop drinking so much, you know. Um, but it was such a culture, and it was such a culture in there, and you were either you either drinking and a part of the party or you were a party pooper, you know. And um...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2791s)

Oh, you'd be bullied and mocked mercilessly if you didn't join in the drinking. My gosh, yeah. It was, people would make your life hell if you didn't drink.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2801s)

Yeah, yeah, 100%. So yeah, like I said, I reported the assault to my local priest and he told me it was my fault, which I then believed for the next 20 years until I got therapy around 34 years of age. And I was unequivocally told that obviously I was 14 years old, even if I was sober, that I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2831s) have the capacity to consent to such an interaction.

But I was also drunk. And so just to add an extra layer of messy. Vulnerability. Yeah, and vulnerability, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2848s)

And was this 20-year-old man ever dealt with? Was he talked to? Was he spoken to? Was it reported to the police?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2855s)

Definitely wasn't reported to the police. But I remember his priest's name was David Heath, and I can remember his priest saying that the prolific amount of sexual abuse that this man had perpetrated on not just myself but like other young members was eye-watering. So it wasn't just myself, it was other young men as well within my town, which was [Pukekohe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2885s) at this stage.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2887s)

Not only that, it was well known.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2889s)

Yes. Yes.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2891s)

And authorities were never brought into it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2892s)

No. No.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2894s)

No. No.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2896s)

Do you think this person's still in the Brethren?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2899s)

No, he's not in the Brethren. He's left and he's married with children now. He's out of the Brethren.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2905s)

Right, but possibly never been held to account.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2908s)

No, not that I'm aware of. Not that I'm aware of. I just want to also, I want to just say right now, just very quickly, um, the reason why I'm choosing not to name these two people that sexually assaulted me is because I I believe in one, specifically the woman, I don't think she would have done what she had done if they were if she was in the PBCC. I'm not excusing her behavior 100%. Like so many in there come of age and then like most [individuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2938s), they begin to have these like very natural desires. But unlike regular people, they don't know what to do with them. And since they're not only uneducated on how to manage their physical desires, they're also not allowed to date. 

So instead of their desires being like managed consensually, they get bottled up and then in some horrible, horrible occasions, they're forced upon someone innocent. Yeah. Um, I noticed that like, like when the young men of [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=2969s) age in the PBCC would get to a certain level of intoxication, they would turn these bottled up desires upon each other. And they weren't gay. They weren't. They just didn't have a constructive outlet for them. What happened to me was unquestionably wrong and so unlawful. However, I personally don't want to like, I guess, name them and shame them because also the statute of limitations in New Zealand is six years. And if I accuse anyone, given that I have little to no evidence of what actually happened to me apart from like my own words, I could be tried for defamation of character.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3019s)

And that is something. Was the female much older than you at the time?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3021s)

Oh, she was like a lot older. She would have been, again, sort of like late 20s, I think, as I recall. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3030s)

So quite a bit older.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3032s)

Yeah. Yeah. So moving on from that, um, I kind of realized that I couldn't survive when I was 15\. I couldn't survive in the church. So I contacted my older brother who had left at that stage and he had married, he was starting a life for himself. Contacted him, asked him to help me leave, and he said that he would. He asked me to be really honest with him because he said this [process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3062s) was going to be difficult, given that I was 15 and had to be emancipated from my parents. Um, so I told him that I was gay. Um, and he immediately was like, no, we can't, we cannot take you, we cannot help you, because if you come out, homosexuality is very celebrated out here, you are not gay, um, and you will just turn to that lifestyle and like we'll lose you pretty much.

 And I said, okay, great. Like it was this the first time I actually [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3092s) kind of faced that kind of like, um, distaste for homosexuality. Um, so I just said like, that's great, no one helped me, fine. Please don't tell my mom and dad. Like, please don't tell mom and dad that that this is what I've told you. And unfortunately, he told my mother. Um, she handled it pretty well. She was upset to begin with, um, but she handled it pretty, pretty well given her, you know, like very little knowledge about [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3123s) topic. And she didn't tell my dad. I think somehow the rest of the family found out, but it was all just like shoved under the rug and sort of just pretend that doesn't exist. And I was quite happy for that to happen because I was 15 and I was so ill-equipped at that stage to deal with coming out.

I was very happy in there.

Obviously, moving on, I'm kind of realized that being this way, you know, being gay, wasn't a phase. And I was kind of faced with a couple of impossible choices. Either marry a girl and ruin two people's lives, or say goodbye to my family permanently and try to make it in the world, which I believed at that stage would take everything that I had from me and then leave me for dead. So I chose a third option. I [attempted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3179s) to take my life. It landed me in hospital where I met a very lovely psychologist, one of the few occasions where Brethren have listened to psychologists.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3700s)

Like your first level of excommunication. So it's like you're shut, they call it being shut up. So it's like your first level of confinement. The next level is being completely kicked out. It's called withdrawn from.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3712s)

Yeah, yeah. And those terms are, they are interesting because confined, yeah, confined was a term that was used and like it literally does, I mean, Isaac, it reminds me of you said earlier that your dad would, you know, put you guys in this little through this little door under your house, but it reminds me of that. Like to be confined, just to have your your freedom and your movement restricted. And same with the term shutting up, like I think originally it probably meant to close up, but when we hear it now, we think shut up over, you know, tape over your mouth. And effectively it's the same thing. 

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3742s) it's very, it's very psychologically severe treatment to go through, even though it's not the full excommunication process. It's it's almost the same, except that you're still visited by priests because they're hoping to restore you, whereas once you've been excommunicated, they give up on you completely and you're gone and you're no longer visited by priests usually. But so shutting up is is an extreme psychological thing to go through. Um, I mean, when I look at, you know, here in New Zealand, it's illegal, for example, [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3772s) put people into solitary isolation, um, in prison or in, you know, mental health care units or whatever.

 But effectively, that's what being confined is. You you get put into solitary isolation. And and so often that means that, um, yeah, nobody other than the priests are allowed to talk with you and they may only come every few weeks or every few months. Some people have gone for over a year without being visited. But so your family members are not allowed to talk to you, friends are not allowed to talk to you. If you're employed, you [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3803s) talk to your workmates. Um, and and bearing in mind as well that you've your whole life you've gone to church every single night of the week and then multiple times on the weekend, but all of a sudden you're forbidden from that. Yeah, you have to eat your meals alone, often in your bedroom in your house, so you can't eat with your family, you can't talk with them. It's totally cruel. And sorry, Isaac, what age were you and were you at school or working when this happened?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3829s)

I was, I was, I was at work when this happened. Um, I was 22\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3834s)

You were at work.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3834s)

Yeah, and it, I remained, so they kind of like, when I returned, they moved me out of my home and they placed me in the studio apartment. So it was literally like like a small lounge with a bed and a kitchen in it and then a bathroom off. That was it. And I was there on and off for like 15 months, mostly. Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3860s)

Yeah, wow. And you would have been employed by Brethren because that's all you're allowed to do.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3866s)

No, so I was, I'd lost my job because obviously I didn't give notice for going away on holiday, but I couldn't because if I gave notice, then I would be found out and stopped from going.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3880s)

Okay, so you lost your job with Brethren people.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3883s)

Yes, I did. And I was required to find work elsewhere, um, which I did. And yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3890s)

Wow.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3891s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3892s)

So you actually began to work for a non-Brethren? Well, like was that actually a good thing in retrospect? Like that's actually giving you a doorway into some more autonomy.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3905s)

Yes, it was.

It was good in the fact that they gave me the tools to kind of like, I I was forced to learn the tools on how to like apply for like other work. That really helped. That really, really, really helped, for sure. And I also, because I, I, I oddly enough began working for a company that, um, did boat building, um, using like teak wood, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3939s) I learned all these different skills, like woodworking working skills, and which I just like I use today now. So that was, that was, that was actually really great. I actually really enjoyed it. Um, I'll be enough like working in literally a sawmill, really. Yeah, creating, um, again, creating like these beautiful boats out of the like a log, like an entire log would come in and we'd literally cut it up and then like [quarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3969s) saw it and literally create an entire boat out of this. It was amazing. I had so much, I actually had a lot of fun. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3981s)

And so your priest came to this job, like it was a, and to tell you that you had been confined?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3987s)

Uh, no. So basically what happened was when I got back from from America, I was told that I wouldn't be living at home. So I got moved out and they said I would need to pay for my own accommodation and I need to find work. So I immediately found work. I found it pretty quickly, which is great, at the at the the teak decking saw place. Yeah. And then I was just functioning through like, functioning out of like work and home. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4018s) they would come and visit me in in this like little studio apartment. I had another priest assigned to my case. His name was James Pierce. David, who I previously mentioned, he had changed completely. He went from being obviously a very loving, caring father to being just very cruel, very malicious. It was almost like I had wronged him in some way and he was sort of punishing me, I guess.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4042s)

The very fact that he wasn't able to save you would have been probably hard for him to accept and it would have looked bad on him. So I suspect that possibly a lot of that would have come from the feeling of being fate, of failing with you. Um, and so his only way of expressing that would be to get back at you or to, yeah, take it out on you, I guess.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4070s)

Yeah, I I don't know that.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4072s)

In fact, I obviously don't know that for fact, but I just feel like in this situation that he, taking you under his wing and he was probably, you know, like tasked with saving you as such. And then when he failed at that, it would have looked quite badly on him and reflected quite badly on him in in the terms of the community. Um, and so he was possibly retaliating by taking that out on you.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4101s)

Yeah, yeah. I was like 100%. I think like, um, that that seems, that seems fair. Like I was, but I just genuinely blinded. Like he was a completely different man. Um, there was nothing of that kind, decent, like father-like soul. Um, he was cold and hard, and the stuff that he would say was just absolutely designed to just literally floor me and [break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4132s) me, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. This was the worst period of my life to date, weirdly enough. It was unlike anything I've experienced before, the torment of being stuck in a room for hours on end, yeah, knowing no end, like an end date. And in some ways, I mean, I don't know what jail is like, and I I don't ever want to know what jail is like, but in some ways, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4162s) would like almost prefer jail because there is a term which you can work towards, you know, there is some hope. 

Um, in this case, there was none. I would ask, like I was just in this perpetual state of limbo, I guess. I would have like to have left at that stage, but David and James, they made their blackmail very clear that if I would continue to do what I wanted, I would just no longer have the same relationship with my family. [In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4192s) short, I would be excommunicated. And David knew prior, obviously, to me going to America, I confided in just how much my family meant to me. They were everything. I didn't want a life without them. And he knew that, and he used this as a way to keep me in that apartment. I can remember asking, consistently asking David and James why they were doing this, and they told that it was because I was lawless. [Just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4222s) pointing out, just a little point here, I don't think someone who is trapped in a high demand religious group that's just trying to wrestle back a little control of their lives can be called lawless. The leaders of the PBCC, they they perpetrate this awful mentality that if you villainize someone enough, then you will feel justified and in some cases, righteous when you treat them badly or unlawfully. If you create a [villain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4253s) mentality of a person, you can do whatever you want to them.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4258s)

That's exactly right. Yeah. And they also teach, you know, they've got phrases in there like the assembly loves a broken person. Um, you know, like they teach a high value on somebody being psychologically smashed so that you are completely submissive, which again, you know, that is a tactic that's well known to be used among highly coercive controlling groups or individuals to psychologically break someone because then they're [useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4288s) because you can, they'll do whatever you tell them to do.

 And the brethren have laid this religious language over that to try and make it sound like it's come from the bible or come from, you know, that it's a spiritual or religious ideal to be broken or that then you're humble or, you know, putting other values like that on it. But, um, actually it's about, yeah, psychologically smashing you so that you are just, um, you know, useful to them because you're not someone who causes any waves or challenges the authorities.

 [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4318s) just do what you're told. Um, and you know, when they say something like that, you're lawless, um, yeah, they're referring to the fact that there's this part of you that is refusing to just lie down and surrender to everything that they're coercing and forcing you to do and to be. Um, and so yeah, then they choose, as you said, they choose this negative language to put onto you to make it like a, yeah, a moral and an ethical judgment on you, [whereas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4348s) actually it's not lawless, it's not bad. As you said, it's not, it's perfectly normal for people to want to ask questions about how they're being made to live.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4359s)

And if anybody hasn't watched episode 110\. Like that was, that was the podcast with the audio of a priestly visit. And that was a perfect example. Like it, that was, it was such a heart wrenching podcast to create, but it was very much needed so people could wrap their heads around what each and every one of us have been through. When we talk about the absolute horror of what a [priestly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4389s) visit is like, and like you, Isaac, I very much relate to you on these priestly visits where I, I never saw a way out for me. I just wanted the torture to stop, right? And so same for me, I was just out for me. I was just, I was going home. I was going to take my life, but I was just going home. I wasn't gonna, I didn't deserve that kind of torture. And there's no way out of it, especially when they use your family as leverage on what they can do to you. 

And so [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4420s) priestly visits, like you heard in podcast 110, that is what happens. These priests just become ruthless in trying to break you. And they get absolute joy out of it. I mean, my priest did. My priest got absolute joy out of watching me break or our family break to the point of where you're sobbing in tears and you literally don't know how you're going to get up from it. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4450s) so I do think that this is one of the biggest issues that I hope down the road, the Royal Commission, those people that take care of what's happening inside the PBCC, listen to an audio like that and listen to the pleas of every single one of us that are out here retelling our stories. That's the message we're trying to get through is that there's absolute horror that is happening inside there, still happening to this [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4480s), that if we could just get the law involved, this stuff should not be happening in a mainstream Christian church as they call themselves.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4490s)

It's psychological abuse. Like it's it's literally psychological torture to break you to the point where you would do everything that they say. And they're using every tool in the book that they possibly can. And you're at their mercy. You are completely at their mercy as to when it's finished, as to when, like, they really want to be able to tell that you've given up every thread of self-will. And that's the goal, is that you have literally given up every thread of self [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4527s) and they will not relent until you do.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4531s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4533s)

I've been out 32 years. It'll be 32 years this year. And one of the main things that I still go to therapy over is how to recover from those priestly visits. It's hard as an adult to get yourself back up when the tiniest thing can trigger you to go back into that mode of submission that you had to be in in order to be able to get out of the situation that you were in. So it is, it is, I guess it's something that's very near and dear to me on [trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4563s) to find some way. I had a conversation with the police the other day. I was sobbing my face off at trying to convey to him, like, what do I do? Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do in order to get laws changed, right? If we can't, it's just, it's heart-wrenching hearing and reading the stuff that lands in my inbox and trying to fight the battles that I'm fighting. When I want, it's the laws that we need. We need [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4593s) change the laws. We have to find a way to change the laws, but it's hard to get inside those laws when we're met with this rhetoric of the lies that the PBCC give back and the way that they find a way to cover up. Like my heart is breaking inside for you, Isaac, because I relate so much to your pain and I think it's super important that we come together as a unit and try to find ways to [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4624s) inside the legal system, get inside a way to be able to really let these people know that are in charge of making these laws that this is still happening. I had reported back to me something that was just said and it literally was reported to the police that this stuff no longer goes on.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4648s)

And

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4648s)

I'm trying to tell the police, no, like I would love to hand you over my computer and you can read everything that comes into my and onto my inbox.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4657s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4659s)

As of 2024, everything that Isaac is saying, everything that you heard in podcast 110, everything that every survivor comes on here and talks about is still happening in 2024\. Yeah.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4673s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, like like as you said like, Cheryl, like they were, my priests, David and James, they were, um, David specifically was like he had he he took great joy in doing what he did to me. There was this one time where I did actually cry, right? And he was smiling, um, while I was crying. Like I just... just blindingly awful. Um.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4705s)

The sad part about is they actually believe that they're doing the right thing. Like they are so indoctrinated that they they genuinely believe that they are doing the right thing. And it's just, it's so, so mind-blowing.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4720s)

And that's unfortunately why they are so successful. Yeah, yeah, because of that belief. Yeah. Obviously, like I said, this period was undoubtedly the worst period of my life to date. During this time, I wrote a short note what was being done to me and I can remember being worried that because I can remember being worried that I'd eventually break and make another attempt, this time more, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4750s) permanent attempt on my life and these priests would get away with what they were doing. And so I made this note and planned if I ever got to that stage again, that I would send it to both law enforcement and a newspaper before I did anything permanent.

And yes, what they do is a crime. I looked it up. It's called deprivation of liberty. Um, for those of you who, um, maybe listening that is still in there.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4791s)

Private deprivation of liberty.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4793s)

Yes, and in some cases, um, yeah, in some cases that can be classified as kidnapping, um, if you are a part of a high demand religious group.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4804s)

Because it is a human right. And again, you know, the human rights things a bit tricky because some of it's not actually, you know, you can't actually prosecute for it or whatever. But and if you look at the bill of human rights that New Zealand agrees to and that kind of thing, um, yeah, freedom of movement. I remember the first time reading that going, freedom of movement is a human right. Like you can move wherever you like around your country, you can live wherever you like, you can go on holiday wherever you [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4834s). You can hop in the car and drive to see someone or fly somewhere. You do not have to get anybody's permission. 

And I just remember being so shocked when I read that because I was like, oh, like the Brethren routinely, yeah, have got have got, um, whatever you want to call it, doctrines or values or whatever language you want to use it. But for the common person in the Brethren, you, uh, my understanding is that you have to fill out a form to get permission to go and visit a family [member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4864s) in another city or at least to get approval or at least to notify somebody about it. I'm not sure of the exact things today, but like we knew we couldn't just take holidays. You knew you can't move house or join a different Brethren suburb without going through the right approval channels. So it's like, oh wow, okay, like there's just things in there we accepted that we didn't realize are actually, I think, quite possibly a breach of some of the human rights. Yeah, I agree.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4889s)

This is the note, um, that I wrote. Um, I actually ended up including it later on in a letter that I wrote to Bruce Hales to request some kind of compensation for time stolen. Because when you go to prison wrongfully in New Zealand, you get a million dollars per year for wrongful incarceration. And this wasn't not only wrongful incarceration, it was illegal as well. And I'd spent over a [year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4919s) in this little apartment.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4924s)

So you wrote to Bruce Hales?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4926s)

Yes, yes, I did.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4929s)

Asking for compensation for that time?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4931s)

Yes.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4932s)

That's fascinating, Isaac. Tell us about that.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=4938s)

I'll tell you about that later. But yeah, we'll definitely get into that. So without further ado, I'll just read this note and this will kind of give you a bit of an idea of where my mind was and what was really happening.  
He asked them to leave the room. And oh wow. And they did. And he had a very like stern talking to me. He's like, you are not the type of person who I see in here or I have to do with. You're a very smart, very bright young man. You have so much going for you. If you could see the life that I can envisage for you, you would be blinded by all of its goodness.  
There is nothing wrong with you. Uh, you can live a happy life with a man and you won't go to hell for it. In that moment, in that moment, like obviously you get to a stage where you do lose all hope and you don't, you know, you don't want either life. So you choose, you know, you choose that, you know, you to end it because not because you want to die, but you want your life as it exists right that that [stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3248s) to die. That's that's what. I [mean,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=60s) I wanted to believe so badly what this man was saying. I wanted to believe him so badly, but what he sounded was just too wonderful to be believable.

Contentment of that level surely could only be imagined and not able to be lived. During and after this period, it's not another thing I just want to like want to touch on that might help maybe some listeners in the Brethren. During and after this period, I can remember coming into contact with individuals who had left the PBCC and inevitably they would take it upon themselves to vigorously point out all the evils and failings of the organization. To me, this [approach,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3293s) I mean, would always leave me feeling miserable and somehow annoyed with them as the messenger, instead of being upset with the real evil, the individuals who actually ran the PBCC and perpetrated all of this awfulness that I was experiencing.

Now, I believe, I'll put it to the group, what you guys think, but I believe this was due to them kind of disrupting me sleeping at the wheel of my life, so to speak. I subconsciously kind of already knew what they were telling me, but hearing this inconvenient truth so obviously laid out for me at this stage when I didn't have the knowledge or capacity to do anything about it only caused further misery on top of everything else I was trying to navigate. Like I don't believe a lot [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3340s) individuals who are still in the PBCC need to hear that where they are living is fundamentally evil.

Instead, I think they need attainable solutions to navigate their way to real freedom. Something I would have sincerely appreciated and something I believe that you have managed, Lindy, with again, the Olive Leaf Network. So thank you. Thank you so much for that. Oh my gosh.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3368s)

I think also, um, a part of what you're you would have been experiencing is that when when you're told those things, they're very uncomfortable. And the indoctrination that we grew up with was that if it's uncomfortable, it's from the devil. And so you shut it down, right? You just shut it down, shut it out, block it out. So I think that when you're told things that you really [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3398s) started to think and been uncomfortable with, you've learned to close that down. But then when somebody reaffirms that, it's even more uncomfortable because it's dragging those feelings back up.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3412s)

And

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3413s)

and so your immediate instinct from the indoctrination is to just close it down, put it away. It's from the devil.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3420s)

Yes, exactly.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3422s)

That's why it's so confronting.

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3424s)

Yeah, yeah, 100%. I think they'll have these inbuilt like security measures. I sort of like think of it as a prison, um, where you've got like them the the the bigger walls inside, you're inside, and you climb over that wall and then there's this like other wall that you have to climb over. And so, you know, those people sort of are helping me get out the first wall. Once I was out the first wall, then these like alarm bells and like these kind of security measures were going up. 

And [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3454s) in the form of like my own indoctrination, um, you know, like, um, the discomfort of having to listen to this and yeah, yeah. No, 100%, like I believe that. And I've experienced it with one of my sisters as well. Like I'm speaking to her and then her messaging me and telling me she can no longer speak to me because, um, she was beginning to have doubts and the doubts were of the devil and so on [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3484s) so forth. And we've all heard, yeah, so yeah, 100%. Yeah. So in my 20s, I kind of like felt my fate in the PBCC was sealed, so I decided to once again go back to having as much fun as possible. Um, if I was going to be forced to live a certain way, then damn well was going to enjoy it. So I ran off to Fiji. Nothing like a summer holiday.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3513s)

Yep. You were like 17 or 18?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3517s)

Yeah, 18, 18, 18 years.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3520s)

And like again, for the viewers and listeners, unheard of. You are so not allowed to go to Fiji because there's no Brethren in there and no meetings. And Isaac and a friend just like booked flights and toodled off to Fiji, right?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3535s)

Yes, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3539s)

How long were you there for?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3539s)

For two weeks. It was spectacular. I still have fond memories of that trip.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3544s)

How overwhelming was it in the terms of just suddenly, did you feel like you just landed on like a whole another planet?

### [**Isaac Foster**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3552s)

Yes, I mean, we met a lot of people there, um, who sort of like figured out like we were very young, like a very, very young cohort. Like a lot of the people were like in their 20, like mid-20s or 30s. And we would meet a lot of people there and they're like, where have you come from? We're like, oh, we're just running from the law. Um, like, are you kidding me? Like, yeah. Um, we're like, [keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3583s) running. Like, don't go back.

Yeah. Um, so no, it was it was it was a good time. I like, personally, I hope my friend enjoyed it, but I personally really enjoyed it myself. Um, and it kind of gave me a bit of a a view of what life could be like out, um, out there. You know, like not having to check your six, you know, like not not looking over your shoulder, just waking up and like just getting on with your day. You know, like, you know, you snorkeling on the beach with a book. Yeah, just [eating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3616s) when and whenever you wanted was very much enjoying my Fijian holiday. 

After I returned, a uh, a local priest, his name David Heath from, uh, from my locality started looking out for me. Initially, he was very kind. He was very gentle, very fatherly, very easy to talk to. We had very many like quite a few hours of chatting and it was such a reprieve. Um, it's the first time I was able to talk uninhibited about everything. I didn't manage the sexual abuse, but I did [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3646s) about being gay and like having these desires. And he was really kind. He was very open about this and he said, you know, like a, he told told me that like he had come across this before and this this was unfortunate. He was he was very helpful, very, very helpful. And yeah, again, like being able to talk to someone and sort of like feel, having a father for the first time. I think I told him that multiple times as well, like, you know, sort of really never knowing what it was like to [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ozXLJpJto&t=3676s) have a dad. And so that was, that was, that was really, really helpful, really helpful. However, when I turned 22, I went to America on holiday, caught the travel bug.

And this time I went for a month. And when I'd returned, I'd been confined or for those who don't know what that term means, kicked out.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
