## Summary

Malcolm Rawlings and his young family were wrongly excommunicated in the 1970s. For 28 years, the family kept faith with Brethren doctrine, practicing separation and holding church meetings to the brethren calendar as a household. In Maple Creek, the brethren acknowledged their wrongdoing and the family, now with married children and with grandchildren, were readmitted to the fellowship in Maple Creek, Canada.
The reward for this extraordinary but misguided faithfulness?  The families were bullied, shredded, divided between different continents, and some members were excommunicated all over again.
Fergus Howard, Malcolm’s grandson was caught in this turmoil from a young age. As an “outsider” in the Maple Creek congregation, he was subjected to horrific bullying. When his parents relocated to Worcester, UK, it got worse – much worse.
This is just the prologue to over a decade of physical, psychological, and spiritual abuse that Fergus suffered at the hands of the PBCC. Finally Fergus discovered a message that Bruce Hales had sent to his priest:
“He is thoroughly bad. Leave him to stew in his own juice”
Rejected by his family, the brethren, and the so called “Man of God”, jobless, penniless and stranded in a cheap hotel in a foreign country, Fergus rebuilt his life, from nothing, step by step.
The brethren claim to be prodigies of “care and compassion in action”. This harrowing account proves just how false and wilfully deceitful those words are.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=58s)

Hello everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life podcast Ex-Cult Conversations. We are joined today with Carman and Richard and our special guest Fergus who is going to take us on his journey of being within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and his leaving. We have been absent for a bit, we've all had a lot on our plates and some of us have had to move and we've just been trying to catch up with all the irons we have in the fire. But we do have a lot coming up, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=88s) stay tuned. So Fergus, welcome to the show.

I'm gonna hand the mic over to you and if you just want to introduce yourself to the viewers and listeners and let them know where you're originally from and then just take us on your journey.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=109s)

Awesome, thanks Cheryl. Yeah, so yeah, my name is Fergus Howard. I currently live in Rocky View County, just outside of Calgary here in Alberta, Canada.

And yeah, I was born in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. So yeah, I know there's already been a lot of talk about Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. So by now it should be a very familiar name. But yeah, that's where I was born. Well, no, technically, I was actually born in Medicine Hat just because the hospital couldn't cope with births in Maple Creek at that point. But yeah, lived in Maple Creek, that's my stomping grounds. And yeah, I kind of bounced around a little bit. So I've been to the UK, lived there for a little bit.

I was also down for a little while in San Fran. And yeah, now I'm finally back in, yeah, in my kind of my home country, so to speak. So yeah, well I know Cheryl, we spoke yesterday, but I'm kind of going to recap on, so forgive me for what you've already heard, but yeah, I'll just walk you through my story. It's been, you know, the last probably, well, since 2020, well, no, since the end of 2018 have been the real, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=181s) know, the real kind of drawing me out of the cult, out of the church though, you know, been just in discussion in this, in this podcast. But yeah, so I, interestingly enough, I wasn't actually born into the exclusive brethren. So my grandparents and parents actually initially came from Sutton or Surrey near London, England.

And they were part of the, I'm not actually 100% sure of how it all worked, but I believe it was my grandmother was, you know, she was always part of the church or I don't know. Anyway, my grandparents came in years and years and years ago. So they were already part of the exclusive brethren and they were what they call wrongfully withdrawn from. So on, you know, even grounds that the exclusive brethren say are not right for withdrawal, my grandparents were withdrawn [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=235s) and they were actually out of what they would call fellowship, so not part of the church for 28 years. And during that 28 year period, my mother actually met my dad as a builder who was working on their house in in Surrey, London. So they started dating or whatever you want to call it in in their kind of terms, but my grandparents at that point were already out of the community as part of this 28 year period. So my mother met my father, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=265s) the interesting thing about this all is is my grandparents were, they were trying to maintain a position of, I guess what they would call separation. But it's really weird because obviously the exclusive brethren maintain that they have a position of separation from the world, from evil, which scripturally to a point separation from evil is, you know, I stand behind, but the way that they operate it or the way that they conducted it, I don't agree with. So they were in this position trying to maintain, you know, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=296s) stance of separation.

But the funny thing was they were both separate from the exclusive brethren who wouldn't have anything to do with them and separate from the world. So they are in this no man's land, you know, place where they're, you know, they are, they're literally kind of in solitary confinement as a family. So anyway, the story kind of evolved when my one of my uncles actually read, and this is everything that I've kind of heard, so probably not 100% accurate, but he read in [Mr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=326s) Symington's ministry, who obviously is one of the leaders of the church at one point, he read in there about the testimony, or known as the church, moving to the furthest place west. So my grandparents literally took a pin and put it on the map, and it landed on Maple Creek. Hence they moved to Maple Creek.

So yeah, they moved to Maple Creek, and I can't remember when they actually moved to Maple Creek, but I'm going to say it would have been, I know my mother was expecting my brother, who was born in 95\. So it'd have been around 95 that they moved to Maple Creek, Saskatchewan.

And I was born in 96\. So they had a rough start. Like, you know, I will take my hat off to my parents and my grandparents. They were pioneers. There's no getting around it. They had nobody to support them. They never knew this country, this land, and they moved.

They started a business and bought homes there. And then, yeah, I came along in 96\.

And during that time, obviously, my mother and my father got married back in the UK. So they moved as a married couple to Maple Creek. And I forgot to kind of add that in. But then it had been around 2002, they'd been battling to try and get back into fellowship this whole time. And in 2002, the leader, Bruce Hales, came to Maple Creek, or he was going to come to Maple Creek. And he said, I'm not coming unless the Rawlings and the Howards, or kind of our family [name,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=411s) were back in, included in fellowship. So in 2002, we were brought back into fellowship. So it was literally a case of, you know, kind of one of their priestly visits by the priests in Maple Creek at that time on a Saturday night. And then Sunday morning, we were back into fellowship at the church.

So yeah, that was a whole strange experience in itself. Like we as children, just to kind of recap on that part, we were, that's kind of how we got into the church, but we were living as well as children all the way growing up, praying and hoping as a family to be back into this exclusive brethren church.

We conducted our lives as the exclusive brethren, but outside of the exclusive brethren. So, you know, we tried to follow their, their church meeting routine as closely as possible. And we conducted our lives like they did. So we wouldn't eat with anybody outside of our family church. And, you know, we obviously couldn't have anything to do with the exclusive brethren or the world. So we grew up in this no man's land.

My uncle became my best friend, still would be, and still is if, you know, he was available to me, but those, our family were the only people that we grew up with. And going to school was a real challenge because we went to a public school and obviously elementary school and, you know, the exclusive brethren children would have to separate themselves from the, you know, the non-community children at lunchtime and break time. So they would sit at a separate table and eat. And then, you know, you'd have all [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=511s) non-community brethren eating over on the right-hand side, for example, and then little me somewhere in the middle all by myself because, and the teachers couldn't understand it because they're like, well what's, aren't you part of the same thing as them? And we're like, yeah, yeah, but no, but you know, didn't really explain it as one can't really explain it because it's not explainable and hence, you know, so much is hidden because or so much is, you know, blinded with science because it's not, you know, it hasn't got a [foundational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=542s) scriptural basis to, you know, to be explained. 

So anyway, we kind of grew up in that environment. I'm not gonna lie, like the my parents and grandparents family have changed an immense amount. And I was anything far from the prototype child, like I was, you know, the redneck child who was always in trouble and, you know, looking back, yeah, I was that kid anyway. But I, you know, I was, you know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=572s) was confused, I was tossed about, hurting, you know, it was, it was a lot of turmoil going on. Not that that's any excuse, but yeah, so the family life was disturbed. Like it's, it's pretty, you know, when you tell people about it now, you know, this was my story as a child, they're like, that is, you know, that's, that's pretty, you know, that's pretty intense and heavy. Like it wasn't, there was massive, you know, [discontent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=602s) and sadness and sorrow and hurt coming out in the family the whole time because of the way that they have been treated. So, you know, Saturday mornings when we had our, say, family church meeting, there would be a lot of, you know, blow ups. There would be massive family arguments.

You know, I remember times where, you know, one of our aunties would grab us two kids and run us outside because the things had blown up too much. There was one time where they actually tried to, my auntie took us both into the garage and tried to lock the door, which wasn't too successful because, you know, I think it was dad came, you know, crashing through the door and took us home. But yeah, the family, you know, the turbulence in the household was insane.

You know, another couple of times I remember was, you know, the front door, the glass being smashed out, coming down in the morning at about four and just seeing mom kind of crying in the corner of the kitchen and the table ripped apart. And it was like, just to give you an idea, some examples, it was, it was an insanely turbulent time. Now, my parents have changed and, you know, a bit of a disclaimer here, I guess, anything that I say today, I don't want it to be, you know, directed at any individuals opposed to, you know, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=673s) system that is totally, you know, I can't say totally wrong because there's things within the church which are actually very fundamentally right and very fundamentally correct. But the overall is, you know, it's, it's manmade rules and it's, you know, it's something that's governed and controlled by a man and it's totally wrong.

 But I'm not aiming anything at an individual apart from exposing, you know, my life and the turmoil that I went through. And again, my parents, you know, they've, they've changed. Is the relationship [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=703s) dad there really, you know, kind of not, not so much as my mom. I've got more of a relationship with my mother. And they are still in the church. I am, you know, I'm kind of walking my, my lone path. But yeah, it's, it's not to kind of point it again. I, in my heart, I've forgiven these people, but there is still, you know, the fact that I've forgiven them and I've moved on doesn't mean that my life has moved on because every day, you know, I think about my family, they're not there. These people aren't in my life. You cannot, you're [still,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=733s) although you're free from the control, you're very much still controlled by the lifestyle that has been forced upon you, even though certain things have been your choices. So it's just a bit of a disclaimer there. I'm not throwing people under the bus, but the system, I'm absolutely chucking under the bus. I would drive that bus as well.

Anyway, yeah, so the family life was very turbulent. But then in 2002, we came into fellowship. We were accepted back into the fellowship. And that was crazy. I remember my first time as a child, that had been about, I was born in 96, so do the math, I was coming on six then. All right, we would have been six actually. So I walked into, yeah, walked into the church building and the first thing I ever remember was walking down a slope in this [circle,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=785s) nothing like I'd ever imagined it in there. So inside the church buildings, often they're kind of like, you know, four slopes or the whole, it's like a tiered system, isn't it? So it all slopes down to the center. Yeah. So that was an experience in itself. It was kind of crazy.

But the funny thing was, we actually knew a lot of these children, you know, our age group, we knew a lot of these people simply because actually my grandparents' house was opposite the church building.

They actually lived on a place called 309 Marsh Street in Maple Creek. And the church is just opposite that kind of on Sydney Street. 

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=820s)

So in that house, you were right next door to Mrs. Mamie Drever. That's it. Yeah, that was my ground, their house. And the front of their house faced, they bought next to Delbert and Claudia and made that into a parking lot. So the front of their house faced that parking lot. So when you were in your grandparents' house, the whole view was on the parking lot of the meeting room. Yeah. And I remember when you guys used to walk to meeting, you guys would be walking up the sidewalk, brethren would be walking up the sidewalk, and they would meet each other and dress the same. [In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=851s) fact, your parents probably had the old English silk scarves, and we, you know, Maple Creek tended to go to the crocheted scarves, but it was just like brethren meeting each other on the sidewalk, and then one would go this way, and one would go the other way to avoid bumping into each other, never acknowledging each other. It was the weirdest thing. You know, it just felt wrong in every way.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=874s)

Yeah, no, actually, it's funny. Yeah, I do remember those times because, yeah, we would, we would often, dad worked in construction and he was often working late. So it was often my mom and my brother and I that would walk to, we always had the church meetings in the evening at my grandparents' house. So we'd walk there and yeah, similar time and everything. But the funny thing was actually, like after our church, no, just yeah, just before our church meeting after it, because it was like kind of based at the same time, my aunties and mom, you know, [mom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=904s) and that would all be upstairs in the upstairs bedroom with binoculars actually, spying on the, on the, on the brethren. And they actually, so we knew a lot of these people by name by the time we, you know, we got in. A lot of the children our age, we actually knew by name by, by, yeah, by binocular. So we, yeah, we, so 2002, yeah, first church meeting. And then we started life in the exclusive brethren. And, you know, to be honest, to start with, it was, it was great.

Maybe for six months to a year, it was, you know, it was good. You know, it, it felt like, you know, it was awesome. There was a lot of like times of fellowship. There was a lot of, you know, it's, it's like, it's like that song of Charlie Pride's that often runs through my head of, you know, the new wears off the crystal chandeliers. Well, this is exactly what happens in life. And unfortunately, that should never happen in a church, but it happened in that one. And the new wore off. So that's when my [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=964s) had obviously missed a huge part of, you know, what they would call the testimony or the church progressing. So different, you know, changes in leadership, changes in, you know, the way they operated, changes in rules, changes in so many things, you know, the whole time the system's developing. So they've missed 28 years of that. 

So in that 28 year period, when they came in, you can imagine there's a lot of turbulence, an insane amount of turbulence. So they're, they're coming into things that, you know, they're, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=994s) leaders that they left with maybe somebody like, you know, I don't know this, but say somebody like Mr. Symington, you know, he's what, what he said didn't align with what John Hales said, who was, you know, the next leader or Bruce Hales said. So there was like this confusion in their heads. So they started challenging these things. You know, there was, they started challenging, they were standing in disagreement as to things that were going on in the local place.

And, you know, in some areas, they were, they were, they were right. Maybe in other areas, I'm sure they were wrong. You know, there was, there's always two sides to every coin. But the fact is, they're, they're challenging. You know, it created turbulence. So not only did our family start to stick out like a sore thumb in church meetings, but as children, we started to stick out like sore thumbs. And I was, you know, I was always that kid who'd, I'd never really [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1050s) a good relationship with my dad. You know, we were always at, you know, we, there was always distance between us even from a very, very young age.

 And I, I don't know if this is the reason, but my brother's a much softer nature and he's more of like a homebody. I'm not, I'm, you know, I have to get out and go. I have to, I have to be doing. And you, you would, even as a kid, you would barely ever make me cry. That was, you know, I was taught stiff upper lip. I was raised that way and I was not going to be broken. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1080s) God changed that in my life. He did break me. He brought me to my knees, but that was his job. I'm still not going to, I'm still not going to say that anybody else did that. But so yeah, there was always that distance. So I was even from a young age, kind of starting to go up the rails.

I didn't, I started to not fit in with the church. So I started to have more to do with people who were outside the church, known as worldly people or non-community individuals. So I was getting into trouble with my family and with the brethren at that point, the children, because they saw that I was, you know, at school, I'd be playing with kids that were not at the church. I'd be going into their houses if I kind of got the chance.

I'd be doing a lot of things that I shouldn't. And so the bullying started as kids. Like the bullying was insane. I have never, you know, we used to, you'd hear things in the news or now with social media active, you'll see kids complaining about bullying. And I'm like, you do not know what bullying is. You know nothing about it. It was, it was mad. Like, I remember every single night going to church dreading it because you knew afterwards that there was going to be the bullying. [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1155s) was going to be the, you know, the getting beat up. And it was, it was wild. Sometimes you would go home seriously tattered and torn. You know, if you ever, when, you know, in the, in the earlier years of church, you'd take something like your bike to church or, you know, you'd, when the snow was out, they used to have a snow pile in the corner, so you'd take your, you know, your snow, your snow gear to church, like your toboggans or whatever, and something would get broken, something would get damaged. 

It was, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1186s) know, one time I really remember this stands out was when there was a big fellowship meeting, you know, I think it was like Regina, Oxbow, Edmonton, Kalispell, all kind of conglomerated at Maple Creek. And there was actually knives brought to one of those church gatherings, that was when the bullying was like literally at its height. Like it was the worst. There was elders concerned. There was, you know, there was a lot of concern around the bullying. But the thing was, what the children were doing was actually just reflecting what the adults were doing, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1216s) long and the short of it was. 

So, and even between families, like I know in our families, we would, you know, we would talk smack or talk bad about the rest of the brethren there and then their families were talking bad about us. So, but yeah, the bullying was, it was, it was insane. It was incredible. I don't know how to describe it, but yeah, every after every single church meeting, it was, you know, fighting gangs against, you know, their, those families were born into the [church,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1246s) I wasn't. So the gangs would be against me often. I kind of, I did excite them, yes, I have my part in it. I did love a good brawl. So I kind of escalated things as well. But, you know, it just got worse and worse and worse.

And yeah, so that was, you know, that was how it went kind of from a kid. And we were in public school. And then my parents decided to take me out, or both of us out actually, to homeschool us for a while, which then caused, you know, contention.

My parents were to at the point of standing, well, my parents and grandparents all this time were the point of standing so much on the other side of the fence with the, you know, the kind of locals or the OGs, should we say, that they wouldn't attend things like the fun days, like the brethren fundraiser days that they were funding for the schools and things like that. So again, us kids stuck out because we weren't doing these things.

And, you know, it was pretty obvious at that point that there was my family had a lot of questions around the leadership. So anyway, this was all part of the kind of escalation. So yeah, anyway, I started, I homeschooled for a bit. And by that point, I was getting myself into a lot of trouble, like where there was trouble, there was often me. And I'm not going to, you know, I'm not going to say for one minute that I was not the cause of that trouble. Yeah, I caused a lot of trouble. I did. I was, you know, even from a younger age, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1335s) I sought friendship, I wanted friendship, and I would do anything in the church, you know, even for like a day, I would buy somebody's friendship, you know, I'd buy them something, or I'd give them something in mind just to have their friendship for a day. And it was a consistent cycle.

But with things being unsteady in the church at home, then that, you know, that dropped into the school, I started to get into, you know, fighting outside of school and things like that. And I was having a lot to do with non-community children, which was not [helping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1365s) my case. And generally, you know, I was falling to the bad, you know, I was getting into a lot of trouble. So anyway, they pulled me out of the mainstream school. And at that point, the community school didn't start till grade six. So we were kind of, you know, homeschooling for a little bit there.

And then I went into the brethren school. And again, at that point, I was causing trouble. I, you know, and I was, you know, we were already seen as the odd man out. So it's not like you, you kind of watched it happen like a number of times. Like I remember, you know, actually two other brethren boys getting into a fight at school and that was all solved fairly quickly. But when I did something, that escalated way [quicker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1412s) and my parents took it very seriously. They did. And all they saw was this child who was always in trouble. And they did start to blame it on me. And rightly so. A lot of it was probably my fault. But I was an absolute mess inside. And it's taken up until this day to realize, you know, the things that just, you know, there was no safe family life. There was no chance of ever sitting down with your father. You were taught not to trust the community, even though you were part of it, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1442s) they hated you. So it was just all around continual conflict. So I was taking these things out. And again, I do not justify my actions one tiny bit, but it wasn't long before I got kicked out of the brethren school. That was, I think I was starting grade seven. So I went into grade six and I was like, or halfway through grade seven, something like that. When I was kicked out of the brethren school. So then I went back to homeschooling for a bit.

And I was, yeah, I was homeschooled with my brother at home. And yeah, again, that was kind of a story by itself. But we were homeschooled until it had been around 2009\. And my parents made this big decision that they were going to move back to the UK. And it had been, you know, there'd been a lot of talk of that all the way through this time period of moving back to the UK. And I actually, you know, we were told how awesome a place the UK was because my parents were from there, you know, it was all the, they loved their home country and they were telling us how great it was. So we were, you know, we were excited to move back at a point, but they obviously had to go through the leadership of the church. They had to speak, you know, with the elders of the church that had to go to Bruce Hales, who's the leader now.

And, you know, have this whole process to go through. So in 2009, yeah, they finally made the decision that in September of 2009, they were going to move back to the UK. And as a kid, I was hitting, you know, 12, 13, then that is, it is an incredible upheaval, an international move amongst a church that already, you know, you know hates you, you never know what's waiting for you the other side. 

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1550s)

[Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1548s)I stop you for a second and ask you a question? When you talk about the bullying in the kids, did you see that going on in the meeting? Like what we saw in Maple Creek is when the kids were fighting, it was because the adults were fighting in the meeting. Is that probably still the case?

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1567s)

An absolute reflection most of the time. Yeah. Like it was, yeah, it was the, the fighting amongst the adults was, it was aggressive. You know, you go to a church meeting. I remember one or two, I don't remember the, all the scenarios that played out, but, yeah, like I, I do remember times where, or you go to church or remember one time specifically where they kind of started an assembly meeting discussion or whatever, kind of before the actual church meeting or church service started. And I think that went on for like over two hours, just fighting, just constant bickering back and forth. Like it was, it was, you know, it was just something else.

And, you know, in that time, there have been numerous attempts to find some grounds or basis to either confine or withdraw from my parents and grandparents again. So, and they were fighting back strong. And unfortunately, definitely, and this is one thing, you know, the more you, you know, I've actually joined on to a church in Calgary here called Rocky Mountain Calvary Chapel and they teach specifically from the Bible. So it's, it's literally like a consistent Bible study. And you actually realize [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1640s) lack and misinterpretation of the Bible because of the way the leader interpreted it. You know, the way that he said this is what this stands for, that doesn't. And the Bible is its own interpreter, like God's word cannot be added to or taken away from. And that is, that is in his word. But in the church is very, very twisted. But unfortunately, for the, you know, the exclusive brethren, my family did know their Bibles very well. So it was, you know, they could pump politics and science and whatever else they wanted to. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1670s) the comeback often, especially with my father, it was, it was based on scripture, because he knew his Bible well. He also knew, you know, and so did my grandparents, some of the previous leaders' ministry, they were very well read within the church. So they did have a lot of grounds for their, you know, their battles.

Whereas maybe the other side was, yes, they definitely had grounds and whatever else, but it was a lot of emotional, you know, this is what Mr. Hales said, but they didn't understand what had happened. They weren't so well read. But yeah, to answer your question, kind of the long way around, it was an absolute reflection of what was going on in the church or amongst the adults.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1710s)

I think for the people that have watched all the podcasts, I think this is a moment when we can point something out. Like Cheryl would have left in the early 90s. I got there in 1989\. And exactly what you're describing in 2009 is exactly the same conditions that have been there, you know, since 1989 for sure. I can tell you people that got picked on for meeting after meeting after meeting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1740s) just get yelled at the whole entire meeting. And there's a whole generation of young people that left because of that. And now, you know, you're talking about 2008-2009, obviously the same thing. It never got corrected. It was brought to John Hales's attention, it was brought to Bruce Hales's attention, and obviously it continues to the current day because you left in what, 2018?

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1764s)

Well, I was confined in 2018, early 2019\. I left in end of 2020\.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1775s)

So there we can point out for our readers, a course of abuse, complete misuse of a church, because that's not what a church is for, for the last 30 years.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1785s)

And I think it's important to point out, like, I know that you take a lot of ownership for who you were as a person. I think you take too much ownership for it, in my opinion.

You've got to understand, sometimes, like, a child like you, right, obviously sensitive in a matter of sensitive to knowing what's right and what's wrong, what's truth and what's lies, right? You take someone who's born to be a cycle breaker, right, and you place that child in a sad religion and church with this kind of hypocrisy and fighting going on. I think what you did was a natural response of your environment. And I think [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1827s) need to give yourself a little bit more credit for how your personality and how you reacted in things because I think it was a response to the environment that you were raised in.

Yeah, yeah, boy, I just want to go in and I want to high five that little boy inside you that says, hey, you know what, don't be so hard on yourself. You literally are responding to a very toxic environment. I mean, I sit there and my heart just breaks for this no man's land that you guys lived in for so long. Like you had to, there had to be something that kept a fight alive in you to fight against what was so horrifically wrong and [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1868s) this should have been a safe place. This is my, this is what, why I want this church to change is because churches are supposed to be our safe place. They're supposed to be where we go and we fall into when we're at our worst, they shouldn't make us become our worst. Right. And so to me, it's like your soul, your spirit, like who you were at the core of you knew that this wasn't right. And you needed to bring it up to the surface to be shown what it's like. And sometimes our behaviors do just that. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1899s) not that they're wrong. There are behaviors that, I mean, God works in mysterious ways, right? Right. Like it's, I think you just need to be a little easier on yourself. I don't think you should take as much responsibility as you are.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1911s)

No, no. And I appreciate that, Cheryl, and you have got a point. You know, my main reason for taking a lot of responsibility, because you can't blame your actions on your environment or your upbringing. You know, everyone has a point where they make the choice to do right or wrong. And I knew I was doing wrong. A lot of the time when I was getting into trouble, I knew. I knew what I was up to. I knew what I was doing.

Deep down inside, there was two things that I really searched for. One was attention. The other was to be loved and affection.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1944s)

Exactly....

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1944s)

 Those two things. And I did anything for them. Like I absolutely, you have no idea to the extent that I would go to for that attention and that affection and just somebody to want me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1959s)

And that's what I want to make clear is that exactly, the church should have been able to see that, right? Like when I'm talking about this, this behavior escalating, escalating as you're talking about, is a church should have been noticing that and been like, what does this child need? What does this teen need? Instead of kicking you out of OneSchool Global, instead of condemning and doing all these things, they should have taken you in their arms, right? It should have, you should have been, you should have got what you [needed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1989s)

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=1991s)

Yeah, no, no. And I do agree. And, you know, certainly if you did have that circle of compassion and that circle that you could trust with these things escalate, no. And that's what I know now is, you know, having come out of this church and now having pastors that really, really are invested and they care and seeing the genuine inside of Christianity is an amazing thing. It is so different. And actually, I guess the reason that I want to take [responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2021s) is anybody who's watching this podcast, who is still part of the exclusive brethren, you know, say, you know, I know that you've had interactions with, you know, people from Maple Creek or, you know, and they're, they're, maybe they're standing on the opposite side of the fence trying to, I want them to know that I'm, I am being utterly fair. Like, I'm not saying that I did not have my part. I did.

And they would know that. So it's not just a total slamming. It's more just exposing the absolute turmoil that this church causes in people's lives and the way it is. So it's, you know, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2051s) so badly controlled and managed and how just terribly wrong it is and how it doesn't, you know, scripture is so twisted to create a basis for what a man wants to do. And that is what I've learned more and more as being part of a church who actually practice Christianity in the right way. And anybody who's been in the church, I would actually encourage them to read a book. Because I did a lot of work with my young adults pastor when I came [out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2082s)

I was, you know, there was stones. He referred to it in my life as these stones that were not unturned. And he used to really probe. And he's like, but why do you feel that way? Like, what's going on? And he kind of helped me to unturn these stones and do what scripture commands us to do with forgiving those who have hurt us, because that brings healing to us. You know, it's a commandment. It brings healing to us, but also to help me heal. And that man in my life has actually, you know, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2113s) so many people that God has used in my life to do amazing things, but he really helped me an incredible amount. And he actually pointed me to a book. It's by Chuck Smith. But if you want to see a book that is based on scripture and is a truly Christian book, but is pretty much the opposite of everything that is taught in the exclusive brethren, I would encourage you to read it. And it's called Why Grace Changes Everything by Chuck Smith. [Incredible,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2144s) incredible read. And one thing that, you know, and I'm kind of rambling here and I'll get back to my kind of life story. 

One thing that it really highlights when I read that book was one thing that really brought to my attention. Well, there was three things that really stood out. One phrase that he quotes in there a lot. And he says that our righteousness is our faith in Jesus Christ's sacrifice alone. That is our only righteousness. So straight away, this burden was lifted off me of what I'd always been [taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2174s) in the church of my works. You know, that my works governed who I was. And they also governed how God saw me as a person. And the second thing, you know, it, it, I just came to this realization that God loves me. He, he's forgiven me. He's got grace towards me and he loves me. And, you know, I can press into him. He's not looking at my works. 

He's not looking at where I, whether I wear a white shirt on Sunday or I wear black socks or I have a side parting in my hair as we were, you know, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2205s) the rules of the church teach, but he's, he, he is love. And it just, that book and, you know, with the help of that, my pastor just really turned my perspective. I had a complete and utter paradigm shift in that moment of, you know, completing that because it, it, it is, it was so foreign to the way that I was, I was, you know, I was taught and I'll come on to that later on, just something that I was told by an exclusive Brethren member before I left and how brainwashed I was, but just kind of going back to where I was at. So, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2235s) 2009, we moved to the UK.

My father had to stay back in Maple Creek to wrap up some jobs in his construction business. And he had to, you know, he, he stayed on back in Maple Creek. It must've been up to like a year. So he stayed back in Maple Creek and I moved to the UK with my brother and my mother to stay with, it would have been, I'm just trying to think how this works. So it would have been her cousin to stay, you know, to stay with them, live with them. So we could start school in the new term, September. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2269s) we arrived, it was so like, it was, it was probably the saddest day of my life yet. Or one of the saddest days, I should say, because there was, a lot of other sad ones, but when I had to part ways with my uncle and I remember just he, like, I've never seen a grown man cry like it. We were so close and honestly, that was like, you know, probably that, that was the, probably the time that I lost that true deep relationship with him that I have. That [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2299s) the start of that just falling away. And, but Bruce Hales has said, you should move to the UK and, you know, even outside of the church, do children have a say in where their parents moved them? No, but the turmoil of it was just, you know, it was, it was insane. So anyway, we, we moved to the UK.

And we started school there. And again, as always, it started okay. Church and school started okay, but literally probably for the first 24 hours after that, it was, it was, it was all hell broke loose. Like you can imagine it, we came from Maple Creek, two country boys or, or one real country boy who had like no specific, no understanding of fashion. Just didn't give a rip about that kind of thing. [I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2347s) never owned branded clothes in my life and I didn't care for that kind of thing. All I wanted to do was get on a farm and drive a tractor. And then I was put inside all these, you know, these city slickers who, you know, all they could talk about was the latest Golf that their parents drove and UBT and all this kind of garbage. And I was, you know, it just didn't for me, it just didn't roll and I didn't roll for them. So straight away, the bullying started over there. And that was, that was really, really bad. 

**Richard Marsh**

So [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2377s) city was that? What city did you move to?

**Fergus Howard**

 A place called Worcester. Yeah. So that's where we started. Actually, one piece, the kind of key piece to this that I've missed out is all through my growing up years, probably from like, I would say the age of six when I really started to, kind of things started to drift off the rails pretty good, my parents used to say that I was mental. Like they would say it to my face over and over again. You're just mental. You're just this, you're just that. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2407s) you know, I was kind of, like I said, I was raised stiff upper lip, so, and to, you know, suck it up. So I did. And I've never, I always, I always used to think when I used to hear that, you know, how damaging these things can be when somebody tells you these things. I was like, yeah, whatever. I'm tough. But I did not realize how much I believe them.

And I already was feeling the rejection and being the odd one out. And then that started with my parents. You know, my brother was always the one who was the, you know, he never gets in trouble. Why can't you just be more like your brother? Why can't you be more like him? But I was the mental one. You know, I was the one who had issues.

So, yeah, we moved to the UK. And actually, when somebody relocates, my understanding is that a report follows them from the previous locality that they lived in or the previous location of church that they were part of. That report goes to the new locality that they are joining or the new location of the church they are joining. So the report that went specifically about me was,;

“He is a leader, usually in what's wrong. “

So my [chances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2481s) of starting a new life were screwed anyway. And honestly, I think UBT probably started selling paper because of my history file that they have on me because it was cheaper for them. But it was, yeah, this report followed me. And so I'd have been like 13 then when we started in the UK. And I did cause turmoil living with my cousin's family. I started bickering about my parents and my [family.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2511s) I started to cause division between the families. So I got pretty good at that. And I caused a lot of unrest there. So that only turned my family more against me. And in a sense, I was hurting them pretty bad. So they did have a reason, but my side was never seen.

And anyway, so I, yeah, we were in this school and the bullying was incredible. Like again, all over again.

My brother actually, he got bullied as well. Mine was very consistent and I invited it and I carried it on. You know, if there was going to be a fight, I wasn't going to back down. I was going to fight back. So I was going to carry on that fight. If there was going to be trouble caused, I was going to be a part of that trouble because, you know, I was starting to get into a habit of that. But my brother actually ended up going to, he ended up going to emergency once because they [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2570s) cracked his head open from smashing his head on a table in the brethren schools in the UK. 

So this is obviously, we're in a brethren owned school at this point back in the UK. So we started in a brethren owned school. The same bullying, you know, happened at church because we were the odd ones out. We were seen as these people that weren't fashionable, weren't up to date. I remember being laughed at because of my choice of music because I was, you know, I only knew old country music and they knew all this new-fangled hip-hop or whatever [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2600s) was. So, but yeah, the bullying was, I'm trying to just recall some other examples, but the, you know, I, because I, you know, I was where trouble was, and I, you know, it was a way for me to get attention. I was always found where trouble was, but I also became people's scapegoat, because I did not have a strong backing like the others. I was not born into this church. I did not have a family who were [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2630s) to support me, you know, tooth or nail. They knew there were issues and they were the first ones to make a clear judgment of, he's being trouble. So you know, they were not the ones to chuck me under the bus, but to do as a parent would, no, he's, he's being a jerk. So you know, we support you teachers, you know, brethren, whatever. 

So I did a lot of stupid things at the school. I can't recall all of them. There was, you know, there was a lot of trouble that was caused around the school. [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2661s) But yeah, the bullying was just, you know, it's something, it's something else. We didn't, I used to dread going to school and never fit it in. I was always the odd one out of a class of, you know, 14 of my year or my grade over there. And so yeah, I was, I was acting up all over again. I was suspended from school numerous times. But they used me as their scapegoat. You know, if anything went wrong in that school, I got the blame. 

I remember one time, actually, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2691s) was years and years back before I joined that school, somebody had tried putting hydrochloric acid in the science teacher's drink along with pencil shavings or something, and he drank it and made himself sick. So they'd actually done something that was pretty much criminal. And then another teacher who was actually, when I was at the school, our English teacher at that point, she actually got a chemical put in her drink. And I got the blame. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2722s) hadn't done it. I didn't know anything about it. But I got the blame because, you know, I was their scapegoat. And I had a reputation for myself. And so I got the blame for it.

 They did another thing where my brother actually, they formed a gay marriage for him. So they used to bully him as well. And they used to say that he was gay and everything else. So they formed this gay marriage for him and they arranged all this game just to humiliate him.

And they, and again, I got the blame for that. And I was like, I was not a part of that. I said, if there's one thing I do in that school, maybe I'm not always there sticking up for my brother, but I'm not a part of the stuff that goes against him because I'm dealing with my own stuff. I'm not a part of it. But anyway, I got the blame for that. So anyway, as time progressed, I actually got into a relationship with a girl who was local in the city of Worcester. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2782s) relationships in the church are a terrible thing. I started liking her from, I'd have been in grade eight and she would have been in grade six.

And there was just something there. And then it just, it progressed as the years went on to, you know, we'd, you know, we'd call each other on our mobile, you know, when we got mobile phones, we'd call each other, but we'd, you know, we'd write each other notes, we'd pass notes between other people who knew of the relationship going on. Number of times it got broken off. Her parents were, you know, mad about it.

That itself started causing tension, but I loved her to bits and I, you know, I thought I did. And I wanted to marry her and, you know, all the rest. So I was working towards that.

But as you can imagine at school being close and my absolute craving to have somebody for myself and somebody who loved me and have that affection and that attention, I escalated things to the point where, you know, we escaped off, you know, into the field behind the back of the school one day and we weren't intimate, but we claimed we had been, because we wanted the church to think that we had been, so as they would [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2860s) that we had to get married because that is the thing, or it used to be in the church. If you were intimate outside of marriage, you then had to get married. So we tried to claim this whole thing. And she was in, I'd have been in grade 12 and she would have been in grade 10 at that point.

So I got the royal boot. They were like, okay, you're, you're out, man, like you've, you've done enough. So they, I don't know, quote unquote, expelled me. I don't really, they didn't actually, and there was nothing formal that I was expelled, but whatever, might as well say I was. So from that was 2013\. So then I was sent to, you know, I worked at a community business. And I worked there and I ran school at the same time. So they [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2904s) good to me in that sense. They were like, okay, you can earn and you can work at the same time. So I'll give them kudos for that. But they weren't getting to the cause of the issue.

**Richard Marsh**

 So how old were you at this point? Sorry.

**Fergus Howard**

 I would have been 17\. So yeah, that makes it a bit clearer. So yeah, I was anyway, they were trying to give them credit where credit's due. They were trying to find out actually what was going on and they were seeing. But then at that point, I have this vendetta against [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=2935s) family. I were like, they're the problem I'm not fitting in because they don't fit in. They say these things. They act this way. And I was brutally chucking them under the bus to, you know, the rest of the church members. And so it was this massive, like, confusion, just nasty, you know, hate kind of going around.

And anyway, so I'd been kicked out of school. I'd started working at this community company and doing school at the same time. And that was when, you know, we had kind of priestly visits. The priest come to the home, et cetera, to see my parents, tell them what had happened.

And I came home from actually cutting, trimming somebody's grass one day as kind of part of my duties under this company. They're like, hey, this brethren person needs their grass trimmed. Why don't you do it? I loved working my hands. So I was like, yeah, I'm down for that. I'm not doing school. I'm going to trim somebody's grass. So I did that. And I got home and my parents were very irate. They were, you know, I shamed them yet again in so to say being intimate with this girl.

And so I remember, I remember, you know, getting home and they started fighting with me. But by that time I felt I had good backup. I was like, there's these other people who support me. So I'm just going to call your bluff and I'm just going to walk out on you. So I was like, I'm not taking any more of this and I'll walk out. So I did walk out.

And I got to the car and I just remember dad coming out and slamming the car door and like, you know, well, you leave here for good kind of thing. So I went back to the brethren company and I was like, hey, this is what just happened. So they're like, okay, you're not going home. Now, as soon as that happened, obviously my parents were like, we feel bad about this, you know, this was terrible, we did this. Yes, he's got to go and live away, but we're, we feel so bad. 

And anyway, they sent me away to live with a brethren family. And that was the start of [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3052s) lot of me living away and you know, all around, you know, all through this time with me being at school, me being, you know, kicked out, going to the, the, the, the phrase of “Fergus is not normal” was becoming more and more predominant. Like it was, he's not normal. He's mental. He's got issues actually.

 And I missed this out, but in my, when I would have been in, it would have been grade nine when I'd not long started the school, there was a psychiatrist came into school. And he visited with me because they believe that, and all the children knew this, like it was so humiliating. They all [knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3090s) this, that this guy was here because I had mental issues. And, you know, he would come in a couple of times, like meet with me and interview me. And he, he was, he kind of threw his hands up because he went back to the trustees and my parents who kind of organized this. And he's like, he's not mental. He's not like, they didn't get what was going on, but obviously they didn't understand the system either. They didn't understand. And to me, I wasn't explaining to them, this is my lifestyle. This is what I do because [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3121s) me, it was so normal and he didn't understand it either. So we were leaving all that kind of ground out of it. And I was pretty guarded in what I told him anyway, because I was like, something's fishy about this guy, though. I didn't know that that was his reason for being there. So anyway, this, you know, me not being normal was kind of starting to spread more and more. And I was, I was living under this, you know, this smell.

And you know, I lived away at this brethren family's house away from my parents for, it would have been a good few months. So I'm going to say around three months that I was, you know, I was away.

**Richard Marsh** 

Was that in a different city or were you in the same city? 

**Fergus Howard**

It was in the same city at that point. Yeah.Yeah. So, you know, it was quite, quite interesting.

It was very different to everything I knew living away from my family's home because my family were more kind of, they were a mess themselves because they were not quite up to date with the way the brethren did things. They were a little more lax on certain things like what shirt you wore, how you buttoned it up. You know, they were like that kind of thing, you know, how you did your hair. They were more lax on that because they weren't kind of so up to date. 

So living with this other family was like a culture shock. You know, you did mealtimes at this time and you laughed at these [jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3201s) and you, you got home at this time and you did your hair this way. And they were always badgering with me about having my haircut and all this kind of thing. Anyway, things kind of started to progress fairly well for me and I was doing my level best.

And this is, this is where the kind of real, real turmoil as a young adult, or, you know, from the age of kind of 15 up kind of, kind of started. But really, when I was 17, the turmoil of I know Jesus, I know God, but I'm not fitting in and I cannot find my [place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3232s) Like I'm doing all the right things in the morning. I'm reading Bruce Hales's ministry. I'm praying at night. I'm going to church. I'm getting involved in charitable events. I'm, you know, I'm serving at events. I'm doing all these things. I'm wearing the right clothes. I'm, you know, I'm in business now. I'm being successful at what I'm doing in sales, which is like a really key thing for them. But I'm in turmoil. And I, you know, the turmoil was insane trying to find, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3262s) know, who I, you know, who, where, you know, my position with God, like I could not find him in the church.

And even though, you know, I was taught that by doing all these right things, I would find God, but it came back to, you know, what I was talking about earlier, you know, it's, it was, it was trying to please God through works. It was trying to say that these, you know, binding burdens heavy on men to bear, you know, it was these, these burdens were not your way to freedom, were not your way to Christianity. But I, you know, I was wondering why this wasn't working for me because for everybody else it seemed to be. So then the turmoil really began. 

So I was [working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3302s) for this company for some time. And throughout this time, I was getting back to communication with this girl that I liked. And anyway, things started to get turbulent. I was seen as the odd one out in the office. And my sales manager who was also, he was, you know, he was, he was community, he was part of the brethren and worked for the brethren company. He was infuriated because he did not know what was going on. And he was seen as a priestly figure in the Worcester [place,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3332s) but he did not understand what was going on with me being at work and not at school, but he knew something was going on. So he treated me like crap. I have never, like if I was in a workplace now, I would totally have taken him to the cleaners. If I was, you know, the way that I was treated, he would yell at me across the office. He would brutally show me up in front of people, like just, you know, come to my desk and brutally show me up in front of all the other brethren members in the office. So as they were snickering and [laughing,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3362s) I was trashed, like, wow, incredibly bad.

 Like I, you like, it's, it's something that is hard to like explain the, all the scenarios that happen, but yeah, there were times where he would just shout down the office at me, like just yell at me or, you know, just bring, you know, I remember one time, actually being sat in a sales meeting, in a board meeting. And there wasn't a huge amount there, but there was one of the owners there. And there would probably have been around 12 of us at that point sitting in this board meeting. And I was new to the job, but I was killing [it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3397s) Like I was getting appointments. I started off in telemarketing and I was getting appointments. I was getting people interested. I was working hard at it. And I started to get some really good appointments. I was getting the reps into these really good appointments, but I'd had no training. I'd had nothing. And, you know, there, I was making mistakes, but it came up in one, in one of the, in this sales meeting, you know, so-and-so rep went to this business meeting. 

And I was like, hey, that was one of my appointments. I booked that like [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3427s) Mr. Chirpy. Like I did that. Like, this is another one that I did. And, you know, in front of everybody, he goes, yeah, for you did that. Yeah. Yeah. You did that. Like just totally mocking me. It was that kind of humiliation all the way through. The owners didn't necessarily agree with that. But anyway, things got more and more turbulent between the manager and I and, you know, other people in the office. And, you know, I would, I, my copybook was already blotted, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3457s) know, kind of blackened by who I was and the kind of smell that I arrived to that company under. So I, I ended up one day just going and handing in my notice. I was like, I can't do this anymore.

Like I didn't have another job lined up, but I handed him my notice.

And, you know, I was starting to go through the motions of leaving that company. Now, now kind of prior to that, not, not long before that I'd actually just returned home. And so I returned home from living at this other brethren's house within the city. And I remember going into the kitchen that night and my family were kind of sat around, my brother was there, my mother and my father in, in our kind of smaller kitchen, kind of, they got like a bit of a country home over there. And I remember just standing talking to them or trying to talk to them. Things were really awkward. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3504s) my mother just saying to me, things were much better when you weren't here. And it cut to the core, like it cut to the core. You know, the bottom kind of dropped out of my world. 

But anyway, I was trying to get back on this path again and I was doing things like I'd come down and I'd do my ministry reading in the morning at the kitchen table and mother would come down and say, you know, if you can try and look good, but you know, your heart's dark kind of thing. Like not those exact words, but she would, you know, kind of mock [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3534s) for the things I was doing. So I just felt this absolute, utter despair. Every way I turned, I tried, I was just blocked. Now looking back, I see it's God's hand of not letting me, allowing me to fit, and allowing me to not allow me to progress. 

But anyway, that's, you know, I was, you know, I was going through the motions of leaving this one company to join another company, actually, because in my time of being, you know, handing in my notice, I'd written a letter to him, to the boss of the other company saying, hey, you know, I hear somebody's leaving your company, would you consider me? And he ended up hiring me. So I got this, you know, this job, which the other, you know, the company that I was leaving was super shocked about and couldn't understand. So, yeah, I started, I started working at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3581s) new company. And during this time, you know, they, I was still very closely monitored. Like I had a tracker fitted to my vehicle. I was constantly monitored where I was, but I've been getting back in touch with this girl that I liked in the city. 

**Richard Marsh**

So just to interrupt you there, did you, did they tell you they were fitting a tracker to your vehicle or is it just something you found out later? 

**Fergus Howard**

So the first company, there was actually company policy that all their vehicles had trackers. Now they claim that that was to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3611s) with, you know, taxes and fuel mileage and etc, etc. But BS as far as I'm concerned, they set everything against tax. I mean, gee whiz, why do they need to know what's what? But no, not quite. But yeah, so I, but the new company, actually, it was, it was, I did it voluntarily. I was like, I'm not doing what you're saying I'm doing, fit a tracker, I don't care. So they did. And so they couldn't blame you for things you hadn't done. [Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3641s) yeah. So, but they fitted the tracker to my vehicle. And anyhow, that kind of shot me in the foot pretty bad because, you know, I did this new company that I worked at, I loved my job, I loved it. Like I was in there, you know, hand, foot and finger.

 But one thing that was a struggle was it, well, one thing that kind of turned it on its head was it became my safe zone. So I didn't want to do things with the community on Friday night. I didn't want to be around people. I wanted to get [away.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3671s) And so, and work was my escape. Work was something that I was doing well at. And I was kind of scoring goals. So I would literally go there like on a Friday night after church, I would go back to work until like two o'clock Saturday morning. And the bosses there really cared for me to start with them, but I was going through turmoil that hadn't been resolved. And that started to show pretty, you know, sooner or later. 

And again, the whole smell of who I went…when you are in it, in, the [exclusive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3701s) brethren, you can do something and repent about it. You can totally change, but your history will still follow you. And they, they preach the gospel or claim to preach the gospel, but they actually blaspheme because they totally deny the blood of Jesus. They absolutely deny it because as soon as somebody's repentant, confesses and is so to say forgiven, they will talk about that person's history. They would treat them like they've [always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3731s) been that person. There is no break from it. So they're preaching the gospel is total blasphemy. And I'm not saying that in individuals, but I'm saying that as a collective. It is blasphemy and they totally, totally deny the blood of Jesus Christ. 

**Richard Marsh**

I said it before that God casts your sins behind his back, but the brethren keep them on their computer files. 

**Fergus Howard**

And I had a file, like I am not kidding you. Then I'll come on to this, but I had a paper file that would, would have been, I'd, it's, it, you know, it was different files [within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3761s) a plastic file, but it's got to have been kind of three inches thick or three to four when you bunched it up. Like it was, it was a lot of paper going on. And I was like, yeah, now I know, wow, the trees get chopped down, damn it. But yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Like, yeah. Anyway, they, so I was getting on really well at this job, but I started getting back in touch with this girl. And there came a point where we decided to run off. So one night we decided to run off. Now it wasn't anything major. We literally ran off for like a night and, or not even a night. We didn't even stay away. We kind of ran off for the evening and then came back and then we did it another time. So we did it twice. And I had a company car [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3805s) that point. So I created a big mess for myself. Like I was in big crap. I run off with this girl in a company car. I lied about it. I, you know, I'd taken her away and I was all the problem. Like she got no blame actually, got a little bit, but not really. You know, there was priestly visits left, right, and center. My parents were like disgusted in me. And, you know, my reputation went from work from kind of being mediocre to just, you know, hitting base, hitting ground zero [real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3835s) quick.

So, you know, everything I did, I was monitored. I was, I was tracked, I was traced. And, you know, I'll give credit where credit's due that the bosses of that company, it's an amazing company actually to work for at that point. And the bosses really did, they really have my good at heart. And they actually did try to fight my case for me. And that happened a few times throughout. But, you know, there was always the point where the system was more, the favor of the system was a far greater draw than the protection or the [well-being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3868s) or the, you know, the fighting for that individual. 

And, you know, it only goes so far where the brethren will fight for one another or fight for somebody who needs it before they succumb to the system because that is what they want to be, you know, that's just the mindset. But anyhow, I, yeah, so I got into the trouble that I did with her now, now, because we had run away a couple of times just for like a brief stint, nothing major had happened, although, you know, [whatever,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3899s) you can imagine the stories that kind of came out of that. But we, I actually got moved away from the city. So firstly, I lived with somebody else within the city. Then I got moved to Coventry to live with my cousins in Coventry. So literally, as they say, yeah, quite literally.

And that was in 2016\. So 2016, I went to Coventry. And that was the start of me living out of a suitcase for a very, very long time. Pretty much until it would have been early 2021, I lived out of a suitcase.

And so I moved to Coventry and I was living with my cousins. I was still working at the same company. I was still doing the crazy hours. Work was still my escape, but everything was just getting worse inside. My parents didn't really want me around the place. They were saying that my brother's life was way better when I wasn't there because apparently I was this big problem to my brother. Yeah, we did fight. Yeah, I did cause problems in the home. Yes, I did. But he also had his part in it. They also had their part in it. They had a major part in [it,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=3967s) but they did not want to look at themselves. They wanted to look at me and I was a scapegoat and I say these things and I forgive them and they've moved on and they've, they've, you know, they've admitted to that, but it, it doesn't mean that you're totally detached from what happened and I'm, I'm, I'm not, but, they, so anyway, I was sent to Coventry and I barely saw my parents after that, you know, I moved out my bedroom. That was the last time in 2016 that I slept in my bedroom, at my parents' house.

I kind of moved my stuff out bit by bit. I took it all up to Coventry and I lived with my cousins there, you know, did life as normal pretty much.

A couple of major events happened during that time while I was living in Coventry. Well, three major events, really. So my cousin was diagnosed with leukemia. So that, sorry, is leukemia the one where it's the bone marrow? Pretty sure it is. Yeah. So yeah, he was diagnosed with that and he passed pretty much within a month. He was, I think he was 32 at the time with two young children and one on the way. So he was my second cousin's husband.

So that, that happened. My grandpa passed in the same time or, or, or just around, you know, in that era that I was staying and I can't remember the exact dates, but in the time that I was staying there, my grandpa passed and I was actually traveling to Worcester to try and visit with my grandpa. Like my grandpa and I had this weird link where he, he was, I had this softness for him and he had this softness for me. We didn't speak a lot. We weren't super close, but there was just that link that you didn't, you know, you just had. And so I used to go down to him while he was dying. I was, you know, I was trying to be there as much as I could trying to see him, but it was, I was very detached from the family. And obviously I was under this smear of not being really seen by the brethren in Worcester because they all knew what was happening. They all knew that I was, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4085s) was moved away from the city for, for, you know, certain reasons. So anyway, my grandpa passed and I was actually at the, I was at work that day and it was funny, my work colleagues knew that he passed before I did because my family didn't communicate with me. 

During that time also, my mother had been in an accident and I didn't know. They told me because we didn't, I didn't communicate. I was already, by my family, I was kind of this shunned individual. So anyway, he, he passed [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4116s) I actually went to the church meeting in, in, uh, Worcester, which was like incredibly awful. I just sat there with my head down the whole time, sat on the front row. You know, it was awful, that you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife. But in that, in that same period, anyway, I met up with this girl in Coventry, actually married to a guy in Maple Creek now.

And, you know, in fairness, I'll keep her name. You know, I'll keep her name out of it. But much as I really don't want to. But anyway, yeah, so I met this girl. And, you know, we started a bit of a relationship and it snowballed very, very, very quickly. She, you know, we started, I can't remember how we quite, oh, I worked. So she actually worked for my cousin's family business and I was in there one bank holiday working. I was actually working with my uncles on a building supply business back in Maple Creek at that point. And so I went into their office to work and [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4181s) came in and we started. 

**Richard Marsh**

Sorry, can I just interrupt you there? I just lost track of where you were. So you're in Coventry and you are what by now, what 19 or 20?

**Fergus Howard**

Ah, great question. I can't actually. So 17, 18, 19, 20\. Yeah, I'd have been around 20\. Yeah. And you met this girl in Coventry. She was local in Coventry meeting... No, no. And I am kind of rambling and bouncing around here. So yeah, I'd have been in my early 20s and I'm not gonna, let me try and work this out. So it had been kind of around 2017\. So yeah, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4226s) would have been 21 actually at that time. So, yeah, I went into the office that day and I worked and we started talking. Then I got her email. Then after the Lord's Supper one Sunday morning, she bought me some perfume. So we met, they actually live just down the street. So we found some path somewhere around the house and she met up and gave me this perfume. And yeah, this relationship started snowballing. Anyway, after my cousin had passed, like it was [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4256s) deaths within a year, a very short space of time, and I, it did take a quite the impact on me. I knew these people very well and they were quite close to me. And I was again kind of on my head.

 And anyway, no excuse, but yeah, one day I met up with after work, I found some way of, you know, meeting up with her, which is very, very hard in the brethren. Like we had to be so clever about how we did it. But you know, if you're gonna do something, you'll, you'll end up doing it sooner or later, no matter what the roadblocks. So [anyway,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4286s) I met up with her and yeah, we, we got into, we weren't intimate, but we got into, you know, trouble that we shouldn't have done. So anyway, that was the start, the relationship kind of really getting serious and we, we wanted to marry each other. Like we were dead set on it from the early days. And you know, I did, I, I really, I really loved her. 

And I actually, you know, by this time I'd already dumped the girl back [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4316s) in Worcester because her parents hated me. She, I remember one of the times that we came back from kind of running away, and she, her, her brother actually said, well, you're never going to get into a proper relationship. Of course, your parents hate him because you always blame everything on him. So what do you expect? They always think he's the problem. And I was like, you, you, what you do what, like I trusted you. So anyway, that was, we, we kind of ended that one. And yeah, I was, I was in this [relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4347s) with, with kind of very much under the undercover, didn't want people to know at all, but we, you know, we were doing crazy things like messaging each other through LinkedIn, because that was one of the only things we had access to, to message each other without it being traced by UBT. Cause obviously they trace all the phones and the content through the phone. 

So, we, yeah, we were messaging each other. Anyway, I made the call that I was going to move back to Maple Creek. During this period, I bounced between, you know, I'd often come back to Maple Creek [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4377s) because it was my, my hometown. I couldn't settle in the UK. I hated it. Like no offense Richard, I hate that place. You know, it's just, it's too enclosed for me. It's too many people. It's too much about the city. Like, you know, I walk out on the back 40 here and go and tread through horse poop and I'm more than happy.

**Richard Marsh**

 Oh, I agree with you. Don't you worry. Yeah. You can, I find UK claustrophobic after you've been living in Canada. UK is, it's just too small and crowded. 

**Fergus Howard**

 Oh yeah. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4408s) So yeah, I made this decision to move back to Maple Creek without my family to work on this building supplies business with my uncles. And you know, we were, we were slowly trying to get things up and running. But, yeah, so obviously in the church, that's like a really, really bad thing to do. Like you're not meant to live away from your family, like unless you're married. You're not even meant to fly unless you're married, which I had actually done a few times by myself. So like a couple of [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4438s) I'd, you know, I wanted to go back and see my uncle. Like I loved him to bits and this was my home, my stomping grounds. And I wanted to be back here. So I would book a flight, pay for it. And then, you know, a week before I was going to go, I'd be like, oh, by the way, next week I go to Canada. Can I have a ride to the airport?

Which, you know, went down like a pint of warm puke because I hadn't gone through the Orbit team, which is obviously, you know, a team that you have to go through if you want to travel anywhere, you have to go. So just enlarge on that a little bit for someone who's never been in the brethren wouldn't understand the level of control and the exercise over you. Yeah, so the Orbit team basically how it operates and I'm, you know, it's been a while now, but how it operated for me, I did actually go through it, I think, once. But I had to talk to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4485s) elders in the place. And then you've actually got representatives of Orbit. So Orbit is almost similar to the UBT structure, but you then have representatives in each locality or each place. So it's a church, it's an organization within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church that you have to apply to for permission if you wish to travel.

**Richard Marsh**

What's the sort of limit? I mean, and how far can you go without anywhere? 

**Fergus Howard**

Really anywhere, Richard. And that's the interesting part. Like if I, it more applies to like, if you're flying or international, that's when it more applies. If you're staying over, that's when it really applies. But actually from my understanding, and I'm, you know, if you've got to like, take the UK, for example, no, no, let's take Maple Creek. 

Say you're in Maple Creek and you are traveling for business to Calgary and you decide on [Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4539s) night, you know, you're planning your trip on Sunday night and on Tuesday night, you know, you're going to be in Calgary and you're going to be at their church meeting because you can't make it home for yours, because obviously they have a church meeting every night. You are meant to let the Orbit team know locals in, in, in your place and then locals in, in, in the place that you're going to. So that's kind of how the Orbit team works. And it's kind of electronic, it's an app or something, is it? I mean, I mean, this was since I left. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4569s) the Orbit team, when I was there, it wasn't an app. Maybe it's developed now to being an app. But it was, you know, you literally, you had a handwritten form that you had to complete. And then that was submitted by email to somebody who was on the Orbit team. And then they had elders on both sides approve whether you could make this travel. So the place that you were leaving and your destination. I mean, even in North Korea, I think you can travel within North Korea without permission or a passport. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4600s) I don't know if North Korea will catch up. I'm sure they get ideas from the beloved leader.

Yeah, I mean, it's crazy. But you can imagine I did not, you know, I didn't, I wasn't going to go with that. I was in trouble anyway. I was already bucking the rules. Like I have my top button undone. That was a big no-no in the church. I used to, I never wore, too much information, yeah, yeah. And yeah, like I didn't wear black socks to church meetings. I never had a side parting. My hair is always a haystack and forever will be because I don't care and I can't manage it [anyway,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4637s) so that's just how it is. 

**Richard Marsh**

I never had any. I can't say I have any sympathy with you there.

**Fergus Howard**

Richard, don't be so hard on yourself.

So yeah, I was, I, you know, I was, I was getting pre-recorded music. So again, that is obviously outside the church. You're not, inside the church, you're not allowed music is produced outside the church, which is, is randomly hilarious because a lot of the music that is actually produced within the church, the lyrics are far more disgusting and vulgar and, you know, the things that I wouldn't have now being outside the church, then some of the music that I have from outside the church is somebody inside the church. [So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4679s) but as long as it's produced by somebody within the church, it can be as vulgar as you like, but you know, it's fine produced by them. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4690s)

OK, so you're heading to Maple Creek.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4692s)

Yeah, I'm heading to Maple Creek. So I'm, I'm, I'm on my way back. And I, you know, I land in Maple Creek. I get involved in my uncle's business right away. And I'm, you know, I'd obviously left my job over there.

And it was funny when I made that move to go and said that I was going, at first, all the brethren in the UK side were like, you know, you can't really do this. And this may only be short term. And then they were like, get him out of here. Like just make him somebody else's problem. So they did exactly that. So I went off to Maple Creek and the leaders that they're, you know, there's two kind of people who, I guess, are very responsible in the Maple Creek position. Actually, they were very kind to me as long [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4735s) I was there. One specifically, super, super kind. Great. You know, as I was part of the church, they were very, very kind to me. And they actually were going to fight my case. Like they were on my, you know, they were on my case. 

And I, you know, in their eyes, I screwed that up big time because I was not long after I'd been working at my uncle's company where I was super distracted with my relationship with this girl in Coventry. And we were communicating back and [forth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4765s) And it was, you know, we were doing things that we shouldn't have been doing. Firstly, you're not allowed to communicate as a couple under the radar in the community. You're not even allowed to have a relationship, underage relationship, whatever they call that.

But we were doing things that we shouldn't have been. Anyway, the building supplies business, I had to leave it because we pretty much ran out of cash. We'd all invested into it pretty, we put a reasonable amount of money into it, but I was inexperienced. I was trying to kind of run the show and I over-invested into inventory in any way, had to bail pretty quickly on that one. So that was a learning curve.

And I actually went to work for a community company. Well, during this time of leaving, you know, the building supplies company and working for the next community company, I had been in contact with and I had helped her travel from her house to the airport and fly over to Canada to be with me. And we created this whole story for people in both places of how she just up and left and how she just had to be with me. And, you know, we totally prefabbed and lied about this whole thing, what you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4841s) I'm not proud of, but we made this story up simply so she'd get to Maple Creek.

And our idea was that we were going to run off and get married as soon as she got here, but we didn't, you know, we actually got the, the brethren in Maple Creek involved in our relationship. And they kind of helped us work through all the things that we'd been doing that we shouldn't have been doing and get on the path to being married within the church. And, you know, they were helping us. They were fighting our case. They actually, I remember one Thursday afternoon, or [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4871s) know it's been a Friday, Thursday afternoon, I think it was, we had a conversation about what was going on and about potentially getting married and making things right with her family back in Coventry and getting things, the ball rolling for moving out, moving towards getting married.

And there was a decision made at like, I think it was like 11 o'clock at, no, like one o'clock in the afternoon in Maple Creek that, you know, no, it had been early in that about 11 o'clock that, you know, we're going to go to the UK and put things right. And so we were in the airport [ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4901s) to fly out at like 6:30 that night. So it was fast turnaround. We went to the UK and, you know, straighten things out, saw my parents, saw her parents.

And then we all came back to Maple Creek. She came with, and we were on the road to getting married. Like these things were, we were working towards it. Now, a lot of these things were said to my face, but there was a lot of things churning, you know, behind the scenes that I didn't know was going on. And during this time with the new company that I was working for, I was spending time in San Francisco. Like I wasn't actually in Maple Creek. I wasn't with her. I didn't know what was happening. I was kind of detached and things started to drift pretty good.

I was going through with purchasing a home and a vehicle in, you know, in, you know, the hopes of getting married. And, we were looking at rings, we were doing all sorts of things. I was going around, you know, the things were in the community way progressing towards us getting married, maybe even more advanced than they should have been, but within the responsibility and within the know and the agreements of the, you know, the people we were working with. So anyway, we, we were still communicating under the radar and doing things we shouldn't have done. We were, we were still communicating. And there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=4978s) a big, there was a big meeting with Mr. Bruce Hales in Westfield, pretty sure it's Westfield, or somewhere near you nor, I think, I think it's Westfield. And anyway, people from all over Canada, like, you know, we were being coached down kind of in different numbers to go to this meeting with Brucie.

And so the elders of this place or the people that we were working with that were responsible went to this meeting and they were trying to get an answer on us getting married.

We'd written a letter to him or they'd written a letter that we'd all agreed to and we'd sent this letter to him and we didn't really get a reply. And then they asked him point blank or they asked him about certain things, kind of like, you know, how do you help two people that are struggling and want to do what's right and get married? Like kind of a very vague question in the church meeting. And he didn't really give an answer. So we were still none the wiser. And we were at this point, you know, we were working towards dates to getting married.

And, you know, we already, two young people already had these ideas in their head of, you know, they were going to get married and this was the kind of timeline they wanted to work to. And so the conversation started getting harder real quick. Like we were sitting, like I was sitting down and her parents flew over again.

You know, her parents flew over and there was people involved, both sides of the ocean in the exclusive brethren. And I was starting to really get hard and fast with the questions. I was like, so what are you saying? Can we get married or can't we? Like just things aren't clear here. Like I want a yes or a no. Like I can't do beating around the bush. I've never been good at things being up in the air. I, you know, I want to make one decision one way or the other. If it's, if it's wrong, well, I still want to make it at least I know where I'm going. I can adjust, but I was not, I was not comfortable. I was nervous. I didn't trust them. And I have major trust issues all throughout my life. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5093s) so they were, it was harsh in a way on them because they had tried to help us. And then they were realizing that I didn't trust them. But then one of them specifically was starting to get very like sneaky.

Like he'd already said to the girl that I was meant to be marrying, I can't see him staying in the fellowship. Like he's very like, I can't see him staying in the fellowship. Like that was one of the comments, I can't remember exactly how it's put, but passed to her. So I was like, you're already like talking to my future wife behind my back. And then you can't give me an answer. So anyway, one night, it was actually like Christmas Eve, I'm pretty sure we made the decision to run away.

And we were going to go run away and get married, this girl and I. So yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Christmas Eve.

She was actually traveling out of town back to Calgary, which is like, yeah, four hours away from Maple Creek. She was traveling back to take her parents to the airport. She was going with the family to take her parents. And, you know, I was living with another brother and family at that point. And I was meant to be going out with them for supper. And, yeah, we're going out, sorry, going to the last church service of the day and then out to supper. Now we'd made this plan that while she was in Calgary, I would go around and sneak [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5173s) suitcase out at the house. And then later on in the night, I would help her out the bedroom window. So I faked a headache. Like I used to get really severe migraines and whatever else. So I faked one, totally faked it. And so they left me at home while they, you know, went to the church service and then went out to supper. And I said, you know, I'll join you guys later.

So while they were at supper, I went around to her house, took the suitcase that she had there. You know, I just walked into the house, took the suitcase that she had. And then, you know, I brought it back to my place that I was staying. And that night, yeah, about two o'clock in the morning, I took our stuff and we actually used a company vehicle. I'm pretty, yeah, we used a company vehicle. Like we took the stuff from her house and I helped her out the bedroom window. Actually, she actually [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5228s) of got stuck coming out, which was pretty, pretty scary at the time because, you know, she was right near to the, she was upstairs kind of near to the family living area. And it was a window that opened.

It, you know, it was one of those to kind of open like that. So it opens, you know, it doesn't open. So you've got a big gap. It's a small gap. And she was like, you know, kind of hanging out of there.

So I helped her out. And anyway, we, yeah, we went back to one of the business premises and we just waited in the parking lot until a taxi came from Medicine Hat to pick us up and take us to Medicine Hat that night. Because we didn't own a vehicle of our own. You know, we always borrowed or driven company vehicles or whatever, because that's how it works in the community, right? If you're a community, you get to drive a company vehicle pretty much.

So we went to, we got to Medicine Hat and we did, you know, we started acting like a married couple. We at that point, you know, from there on, we were, you know, we were intimate, we were, you know, we were, and we were set on getting married.

We actually, we went to the mall and we bought a ring while we were in. We actually later, so okay, we got to Medicine Hat and then we freaked because what we didn't realize is they were trying to trace us through our UBT equipment. We, we all had, you know, everybody had UBT phones that you can trace, you can track. All this equipment is owned by UBT. So we were just, just explain what UBT is for, for listeners who don't know.

I, you know, I probably haven't got the it down pat like some people, but it, you know, it is the Universal Business Team for the Plymouth Brethren. So it does anything from, you know, owning and, you know, providing the electronics for the church. So everything including, including computers, you know, I don't know if they have iPads, you know, computers, surfaces, mobile phones. They provide company training, you know, they, they're, they, and then obviously a lot of the profits go to the funding [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5347s) the schools, but they would own all the electronics for the community members.

**Richard Marsh**

Yeah. And obviously that's not the only thing they do, right? Like they've set on the business seminars and all that kind of thing, but this is one portion of what they do. So it's kind of the finance wing of the church, the business and finance IT wing of the church.

**Fergus Howard**

Yeah. Yeah. It's, it is. And it's much more as well, isn't it? Like it's, it's kind of when it says the Universal Business Team, they're kind of the hub that brings the network that brings all the businesses together in that training.

**Richard Marsh**

 And then like anything that is part of that, like electronics, things like, you know, it's a lot of things sit under that UBT name. And so they, if you're in the, if you're a church member, your computer, your phone, your phone plan, probably your internet access, everything, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5397s) goes through UBT, and they have specific software on there that enables them to track everything and see what's going on.

**Fergus Howard**

Yeah, exactly. And that's been proven by people who have left before. They've captured their text messages. They've actually traced them through that equipment.

**Richard Marsh**

 I had that experience, yeah. 

**Fergus Howard**

That's exactly what they tried doing to us. And I can't remember how they found out that we were in Medicine Hat, but we got, you know, a girl that I was with and I got wind of, you know, that they traced us to Medicine Hat. So we quickly made the move to get to Calgary.

And, you know, we were fresh out of the church. We knew nothing. Like, we absolutely did know nothing. And I mean, just to kind of put that in perspective for our listeners, it was only 18 months ago was the first time that I tuned a radio to the right channel. 18 months, two years ago was the first time I tuned a radio to the right channel. Like it was, you know, all these things were like, that, that's how naive I was. I knew nothing. And now it just stays on the country station anyway, so I don't know why I learned to tune it. But [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5475s) yeah, we got to Calgary and we started living in the Ramada Hotel, very popular hotel chain. We were living in the Ramada Hotel in Calgary.

And at that point, you know, we were starting to feel a little bit uncomfortable about what we'd done. Yeah, we were living together. We were hoping to get married. We were making all these plans to get married, but we were starting to feel a little nervous. Like things were, you know, there was a problem of money right away. There was, you know, trying to get a job. There was all these things that we hadn't really thought about. 

And our idea was, we were also kind of being, we were like, we're going to make a statement. So as they let us come back and get married, we're going to make this [statement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5516s) So you weren't planning to leave the brethren, you're just planning to kind of force the marriage issue so that, you know, that was a fait accompli, and then you go back in and it's too late for them to do anything about it. Exactly. Yeah, we were trying to force the marriage issue. And we were also, you know, if that didn't work, we were prepared to get married and maybe stay out for a short period of time. But our goal was always to get back. Now that really backfired on us as I'll kind of go on to. But anyway, we lived in the Ramada Hotel.

And we eventually let people know, you know, where we were. And we were starting to feel a little uneasy about what we were doing. You know, the pressure was getting tense. So we let the priests and people come down and see us for Maple Creek. So they came down to see us one night and they said, you know, we just want to take you, we're just going to, we just want to take you to talk to you at one of the local Brethren businesses in Calgary. So they took us there anyway. And we were sat in a boardroom and we were like, this isn't a trap, right? Like you're going to talk to us. We're genuinely going to [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5576s) here. So they said, yeah, no, it's not a trap. So they started the meeting with like opening up, talking to us. And this other guy was there who hadn't really been, he was part of the Brethren, but hadn't really been part of the whole ordeal.

And we were sat there for probably like 15, 20 minutes and her parents walked in and priests from the UK, like we were totally boxed in on all sides. Like, I mean, we lost hands down on that one. We were screwed. So we were grilled right there.

And, you know, we said to them, okay, we'll go back to the hotel and we'll get our stuff and we'll separate and, you know, we'll go back to the, we'll go back to our separate abodes. And they wanted to ship us both back to the UK and to our separate localities in the UK or separate local places. 

So we kind of agreed to this, but when we got back to the hotel, the girl that I was with and I made other plans where we were like, we're going to stay, you know, we're going to, we're going to stay here and we're going to, we're going to see it through. We're not going [back.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5638s) So anyway, we stayed in the hotel and they brought all our stuff and they kind of said, you know, their goodbyes and, you know, whatever else. And so we lived in Calgary. I'm pretty sure it was for like another two weeks after that. And then she started missing home. Like she was already going through turmoil. We were both like on our, you know, on our heads. We were not mentally healthy.

And so we, you know, she decided that, you know, she couldn't take it over here anymore. It's wintertime and she wanted to go home. So we, you know, we packed up and we flew back to the UK. I was like, okay, well, if I really got to grin and bear this, I'll, you know, I love her. I'll, I'll make the sacrifice. So we came back to a place near rural, Worcestershire, and we rented like a holiday home. And we lived [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5695s) for, it's probably like about six weeks. We lived there together.

And then we, the community got wind of where we were. They came around to see us a couple of times. There was like priestly, more priestly visits. It's like, I've honestly probably had similar amount of priestly visits in my lifetime as I've had coffee. And that says a lot because I drink about three cups a day. But it was, you know, it was heavy weather. And so anyway, they, yeah, we threw up our hands. We were like, okay, we've messed up. We'll come back. [We'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5730s) separate. You know, this is, we can't do this anymore. Like we tried to do it and it just, you know, but we couldn't, we were trying to find jobs. We were scared silly. Like it was a big wide world. We've been taught so much about how terrible it was. We'd never worked in a non-community company. Like we, we didn't, we, it was, it was, you know, it was literally like a fish out of water. 

And so, anyway, we, yeah, we, we, we agreed to go back and, we, so we separated. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5761s) went back to, on, on the day that we separated, actually, I went back to my parents' home. The priest came and picked me up and her parents, and I think it was like one or two of the priests, one of the priests picked her up and took her home to Coventry. Now, we were both confined prior to that. So we were confined in January of…no, hang on. She wasn't confined at that point, but I was confined or like, you know, shut up, as they refer to, which is like a preliminary shunning, if you like.

You're in, you're kind of in this no man's land. So I was, I was already in this position.

And she wasn't at that point, but I went back to my parents' house and that was kind of another landmark in my story where I remember going to my parents' home.

Firstly, I got a pretty good rollicking on the way to my parents' home about the way I've been acting by the two priests. And yeah, whatever. Anyway, I got to my parents' home and my parents were there.

My, yeah, my family were pretty distraught. Like they were like this, you know, they were shamed. I'd shamed them in the eyes of the church. And I remember my mom bringing me a coffee at that point. And mom and I are very, quite similar characters in a lot of ways. So we had that kind of close link of I was her son and we were similar in a lot of ways. So there was that kind of link, and she brought me a coffee. She asked if I wanted something to drink. She brought me a coffee. She said, 

"You realize you got to go and drink this by yourself, like in the living room. Well, I'll have to go out."

So they left me in the living room and all [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5851s) out while I drank this coffee because they couldn't be with me.

And am I, you know, in all that I'm telling you this story, would I do this again? No, I'd do it the right way. But the fact is I had tried many, many times to do this the right way, to marry the right way, to go about things the right way. But every time I hit a roadblock, every time I wanted to buy a house, my bosses didn't stand behind me. The local place didn't stand behind me. My family did, but the priest didn't stand behind me. But if other people similar in my age group [wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5885s) to do the same thing, it was fine. They did it, but I didn't get that opportunity.

So do I condone what I did? No. But do I also say that I was kind of, you know, I tried the right way and it wouldn't, they wouldn't let me. So it was kind of a case of, you know, up yours. And I'm going to do it this way. So anyway, I'd had this meeting with them and this was actually getting to one of the points that, you know, the scariest times in my story was when they decided that I couldn't live at [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5915s) house because I was confined. I was too corrupt and they were really going to teach me a lesson. The girl had gone back to Coventry and little did they know we still had communication. We kept a couple of burner phones that we could still communicate with each other.

But so they took me downtown in Worcester city and they dropped me off with a suitcase. They took me to a hotel to drop me off and I had enough cash to pay for [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5946s) hotel. I had cash with me, but a lot of my funds were still in Maple Creek. Everything was kind of half tied up in this house sale and in the bank over there. And the bank didn't directly transfer internationally. I didn't have access to it. So anyway, they dropped me down there and they kind of went into the hotel with me. And then I was alone. I was running out of cash fast. It was the closest I've been to being on the streets. I, you know, I had [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=5976s) suitcase and that was it.

I lived in this, I tried to make the best out of living in this hotel room, running out of money consistently. I got to the point that I was literally buying just loaves of sliced bread to eat because I didn't have access. Like maybe I had the money, but I still didn't have access to it, so it was no good to me. And all I had was cash and, you know, I'd been living in Canada so everything was so different.

And yeah, I was, I was beside myself. Like I was, you know, actually I'm going to back up here, the first night after I left and I ended up meeting up again. So we blew the whole case apparently from going to being repentant to like meeting up again. And her coming down to Worcester, she went to the grocery store with her mom or something. And she, you know, dropped her mom off and then took the car and came to see me. So we blew things up again for ourselves. So yeah, just to carry on. So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6034s) was, yeah, I was in this hotel.

And I, you know, I did come to a point of what I would call, you know, repentance. And I was like, I was, you know, I was pretty busted about what I'd done. In, you know, in the eyes of the church, what I'd done. And, you know, I wasn't proud of myself for the way I'd actually gone about it. But, you know, like I said before, I felt like I really had no choice. Anyway, my family and the priest at that point just left me alone for like, it was over a week. They just left me. They were like, you know, enough, you know, just stew in your own juice pretty much, which that's a very famous quote that we'll come on to in a bit.

So they kind of left me and I, yeah, I literally, like I [said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6078s) I barely had any money for food and what little money I had left, I just started drinking because I had to numb the pain somehow. So, you know, I was drinking as heavy as I could, which, yeah, you know, wasn't kind of adding to the healthiness of my state. And, you know, at nights I would just walk, just go for long walks in the dark and just like cry out to God. Like, just, you know,

 "I know I've messed up and just help me. Like I'm totally alone. I have nobody. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6109s) literally in a hotel room nonstop by myself."

I love this girl who's been torn away from me and I have no hope to, you know, I'm kind of losing hope of being with her. Like everything was just suddenly torn away, although I'd already, you know, done some of the tearing myself. So anyway, I was praying, one thing I was praying for was a job. I was praying hard for a job because I had no source of income. So anyway, funnily enough, I was actually praying my prayers, you know, if there's any chance, let it be with the community, because [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6144s) what I knew. I, you know, that's what I knew. And that's what I wanted back at that point. I was like, I really messed up here. I need to get back into this.

And so anyway, the priest came around and one of the priests actually offered me a job in his warehouse, you know, with these very strict reprimands of, you know, "If you screw up once you're in that car and you're home and you're, you know, you're never working for me again," kind of thing. "‘Cause we know your history and whatever." So anyway, I started working for him.

And for, you know, it was an 18-mile bike ride to work and from work every day. And I had to be at work at around 6:00, 6:30 in the morning. And, you know, and then I had to go home again. So I was cycling for like, yeah, an hour and a half, pretty much every single day. And I was working as well for £18,000 a year.

Like I was, you know, when you talk about putting the body through its paces, I've done that. I've been there. I've done that mentally and physically. I've gone through my paces pretty darn good. And so, yeah, I was working this job and just in the warehouse.

And, you know, eventually I kind of got enough money to be able to get my own apartment. So I lived in an apartment because I was still in this, you know, confined position of like no man's land. I couldn't really have anything to do with my, my family wouldn't really speak to me. If I tried to call them, the conversations always turned pretty, you know, pretty toxic. And, you know, the priest visited me at work, I think it was like once a week to kind of see how I was progressing.

Anyway, they were getting pretty happy with the change that was going on. They were like, "Yeah, he's really changing, he's [softening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6245s)." The fact is you are physically breaking. Like you're, you know, you're going through a breaking point because you are physically and mentally so controlled. You are every day told how much of an evil, terrible person you are and have been and what your history is like. You never escape it. You're living it every single day that you become broken down, not morally, but you are mentally and physically broken down [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6275s) you cannot take anymore. And so this is exactly what's happening to me.

So they were pleased with progress. Anyway, I moved into this apartment and then, you know, later on in the year, they were like, "Okay, we want you to move out of the apartment and you're going to go and live in a suite with one of the priests who was actually my boss as well." So one of my priests was my boss as well. They said, "You're going to live in that suite because we're preparing you for coming back. Like we think you're going to be coming back soon." So anyway, they moved me out into this suite. And I remember being totally [busted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6306s) the first night that they moved me out into this suite because I heard that this girl who I'd been dating and we got in trouble, I heard that she'd already got back to the community and I hadn't.

And I also heard that I'd been chucked. She'd actually got to speak to Bruce Hales and I hadn't. And you know, we were both as much in this boat. Like she had a history as well. Like there were things that she'd gone and done that she had a history, not as lengthy as I did, but she had a history. But she got back in, you know, back in first and, you know, it really irked me. I was like, "Well, it's because you're born into it. You know, your family, Bruce Hales kind of knows your family pretty well." And I was [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6352s) annoyed about it.

And I remember saying to my priest that night, "Well, he doesn't, Bruce Hales doesn't love me." Like just, and that was like the worst thing that I could have said. You know, "He loves all the brethren." He doesn't even know half of them. He only knows what, you know, he knows probably what their bank balances are, but know them, I don't know. But anyway, so that was kind of another turning point where they thought I was ready to come back to the church and [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6382s) I started to make the boat rocky again because I was starting to say these things, like I was getting pretty outspoken about like what, you know, this is kind of dragging on now. Like this was coming up two years of me being out by this point.

And then they promised me that I was going to come back. They said, "Prepare yourself because, you know, we're going to meet with you. And then Saturday morning, you can come back. Like this Saturday morning, you're going to be back amongst the community." So I was like jumping for joy. I was like, "I'm going to see my family again. This is great. I'm going to, you know, I'm coming back at last. I've been through this long haul and yeah, it's going to be tough, but I'm coming back."

Then my family actually threw the wrench in the works because they were like, "We don't want him back in the house. He's too much trouble and he's trouble with his, he makes his brother's life difficult. So we don't want him back." So then the priests were like, "Well, we can't send him. He can't go home. And there's still a lot of turmoil there." But my parents wouldn't meet with me. They would only meet with the priest. They wouldn't meet with me. They would just meet with the priest.

So bitterness was growing because I knew it was them who were stopping it. Like they, that's, and you know, well, that's what the priests were telling me. Anyway, they moved me back out of this suite that I was in with the priest, who was also my boss. They moved me back out of the suite and I had to go and rent another place. So I knew that things were starting to get turbulent again. And I was back in for the long haul. And by this point I was fed up. Like I was starting to, you know, say things like, "I'm never going to get back," quite blatantly to them.

And I was like, you know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6473s) was starting to look at ways of getting back to Canada to my old, you know, to my old stomping grounds. I was, you know, I was doing everything I could to kind of shift away from trying to prepare myself for getting out. But I didn't know how. And I was, you know, I was petrified. I tried that once before and I failed at it. So anyway, I'd been in the warehouse job and they had this project going on in the company where they wanted handheld devices installed for inventory management, and then, you know, the system upgraded [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6503s) match the handheld devices for tracking the stock.

And they'd assigned somebody this project who was in IT, but he hadn't completed the project. So they, you know, they took a chance on me. They were like, "Well, try it, see if you can do it." And I completed it with flying colors. Like I nailed it. I had nothing else to do in my spare time at home, except go on and research how to do this kind of thing. So I killed it to the point that even the provider of the system was, you know, they were impressed at how I'd gone about it. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6533s) I completed this.

So in kind of as a reward, they upped my salary and, you know, obviously I was living in another place by then. So I managed to get some furniture and stuff, but they upped my salary and then they moved me into an IT/sales position. So I was like second in support for IT and I was in a sales position. 

Now, during the time that I'd stayed in the priest's house, there was a lot of things that I'd been doing behind the scenes. So when he was out at church meetings, I was going into their part of the house. Every time he was out to try and find his briefcase, because he's one of these older people that prints off every single email he gets and he puts it in a folder in his briefcase. And I had a file, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6576s) Fergus file that had all my stuff going on in it. So I was dying to get my hands on that file. That's all I wanted to do.

Anyway, it would actually happen the one morning he left and he'd forgotten his briefcase. He was very clever about taking it because he knew what I was going to do. He was not stupid in that sense, although he did do a lot of silly things. But anyway, he left it one day and I started to kind of catch on as to what the notes were, that they were having regular meetings about me, that this is what was going on.

Anyway, now that I was involved in IT was a very, very, very stupid move for them. And honestly, I, you know, I actually do congratulate them on their stupidity because it helped me a lot. But why would you allow, if you had the enemy in the camp, why would you let them have access to your IT? Like that's just dumb, isn't it? Like it's just really stupid. Anyway, the owner of the company who, you know, was my priest, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6635s) used to get a lot of IT issues and I would actually, you know, I would manufacture these IT issues for him. So as he got IT issues, so as I got the chance to get on his computer.

So for example, you know, like, I'll stop, you know, I'd unplug the printer, you know, just wiggle the plug in the printer so it wouldn't work. And then, you know, he'd call me in and go, "You know, my computer isn't working, can you come and help me?" And he knew that I was pretty au fait with that kind of thing. So I'd come in and while he was doing other paperwork, I would be going onto [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6666s) emails and printing off as many emails as I could from the priests and the other people that were, you know, part of my case to read what was going on. And he also had a Fergus file on his desktop. He had all this stuff going on that he was very, very, you know, silly about using. So as soon as I got the chance, I would work on it.

Anyway, that was when I managed to print off something that I knew what they were planning to do with me. They've been through this course of things and I just read in some of the meeting notes that,

 "What do we do with him to get rid of him? Do we fire him???"

 Because obviously they were worried about legal implications. But they, after that, they managed to get rid of me because of COVID. They didn't actually need any legal, you know, stuff. And anyway, if they wanted to have fired me, they could have done because it was [within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6716s) two years that I've been there. In the UK, you can actually get rid of somebody without any real reason.

And then I found a note from Bruce Hales, whether they tried to work, get me back, saying that, 

"He's thoroughly bad. Just leave him to stew in his own juice." 

And I was like, "Well, that's my destination." This loving, awesome man who is all grace and compassion and apparently so godly and aligned with scripture. That's what he says. Like, are you kidding me? Like everything that I'd ever, you know, everything that I try to keep up with all his ministry and all this kind of stuff just [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6755s) out the window overnight. I was like, "You absolute jerk, like you total and utter jerk."

And so anyway, once I read this, I started really preparing myself for like getting out of the community. Like I was, I was joining, trying to join on to different networks to people, but I was floundering pretty bad. And then I actually joined onto a Bible study group. And they were, they were devout Christians, great people who actually really taught me the love of God. Like they, so in September of, it would have been September of 2020, I came into work on Monday morning and they said that there'd been a lot of turbulence in the company all through this period.

You know, I was still carrying that, you know, that history with me and there was so much turbulence, you know, backbiting, I was sitting in trouble, all this stuff. So this was all going, yeah, and also I was fed up. Like I'd done my run. I wasn't doing and, and I was, you know, I was beyond it. So I wasn't really caring anymore. I didn't know where I was going to end up or what I was going to do, but I just [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6821s) caring. So anyway, I walked in one Monday morning and they called me into the boardroom and they said, 

"You no longer have a job due to COVID, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

They walked me up to my desk so as I couldn't take anything or do anything stupid. And then they escorted me out of the building and I went home. I was worried silly because my landlord got word of it and the first thing he wanted to do was get me out of there. Even though I wrote technically had three months, he was like, "Well, you can't pay it, so you've got to kind of leave." And I was like, "Oh no, I'm really on the streets now because nobody's gonna have anything to do with me." Like [family,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6868s) then my family were like, "No, we can't help you. You know, you got yourself into this situation. We're really sorry, but you got yourself into this. You got to, you got to stay with it."

And they wouldn't have anything to do with me. And I didn't really contact them to be honest. I was like, "You know, I'm kind of fed up with this. I'm not contacting you. You dragged me along like this. And I'm not, you know, I'm not having, I'm not going to call you or lean on you or whatever else." So I started to sell everything [up,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6898s) like all my furniture, everything that I had in the house. I sold up till I was down to two suitcases of everything that I had left. You know, I just chucked stuff. It was actually really hilarious.

One of my buddies who worked at that brethren company, obviously, they wanted control. They wanted to see me on my knees and they wanted to send me back to this rental location where I ended up with no money, no nothing. And then they wanted to see me on my knees. And I was like, "I'm not going to get myself into debt. I can't do this. I've got to get out of this. I've got to stay liquid somehow. And I'm not touching my savings. Like what I've got, what little I've got, I've got to keep that." So I started selling everything up, but I was really good [buddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6941s) with one of his warehouse guys.

And I was like, "Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you, can you help me move like on the weekend? Like I got to get rid of some stuff. And you know, I got other stuff that can you take it back to your place while it sells?" ‘Cause I, you know, I listed a bunch of stuff on like, it would have been like Marketplace and eBay and stuff like that over there. So he's like, "Sure." So he borrowed a company van to move my stuff. Now the owner of the company/priest found out about this later on and, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=6971s) know, just, he was, he was, you know, he was cooking about it. He was not happy because his van had helped me get out of my situation, which I found really funny.

But so I sold everything up and this guy that I'd met on the Bible study group, I said to him, "Look, this is my fix. I'm screwed." This is, he knew a bit about my background and my story. And he's like, "Hey, just come live with me." So I flew out to Dublin, Ireland, with two suitcases. And I lived at his house, I lived on his couch, I couch surfed for a couple of months. And then, it's actually so September, then October, like middle of October, I'm going, "If I'm going to get back to Canada, this is my break. This is the point that I get back because this is where I make that change."

But it's a super big challenge because you have nobody to support you on the other side. All your friends that you knew were part of this church and they're not going to have anything to do with you. So you're, you're again, a pioneer. You're going to try and fly by the seat of your pants. So I came out here in October with that and actually met up with an old school friend that I knew.

And they actually, they were, they're part of the First Nation people, actually. So that was, you know, they let me come out and stay with them. And I spent a bit of time on the reserve actually, which was, you know, kind of fun. So yeah, I spent some time with them but unsuccessful in getting a job. So I ended up going back to Dublin, Ireland. And all in this time, I've been applying for work back in Canada. Now this is bearing in mind in the thick of COVID. So this was getting, it was challenging to travel at the best of times.

So anyway, I got back to Dublin, Ireland, and I was still applying for jobs. And I applied for one. And the company that I now work for, they called me up. And they did the first interview while I was in Dublin. I told them a bit about my kind of, not really about my in-depth story, because that's very unprofessional. But then second interview, they did. And then they're like, "Okay, third interview, we're going to want to see you in the office next week." And this was like November, end of November.

And this is only God's provision because I was just praying my heart out that I got a job. And it was in the thick of COVID, people weren't getting jobs, they were getting fired, darn it. And I didn't have the qualifications coming out of the church where they don't let you go to college or uni to really, you know, justify getting the job apart from my experience.

 So I was like, "Okay, this is my dive." I booked a flight and they're like, "We want to see you next Wednesday." So I was like, this was like the Wednesday prior. I was like, "Okay, I'm out of here on the weekend." So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7126s) booked another flight and I was starting to run pretty low on cash at that point. Although I still, again, I had some savings, but I, you know, I wasn't going to touch that. And the whole banking issue was starting to get really complex because I didn't actually have access to it.

So I jumped on the flight and I paid for the hotel and the flight up front. And then I flew over with $600, just over $600 in my pocket, similar to when I, you know, moved into the hotel, I was in [cash.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7157s) And I flew over here. Now, obviously, I had to quarantine for two weeks. So I wasn't able to come into the office for that interview, which I let them know. So they did the final interview over Zoom.

While I was in the hotel, they gave me the job, but I had to accept a lower salary. They kind of counter offered me and took a risk on me because the exclusive brethren, some of the companies were giving me bad references so as I didn't get the job.

So they, you know, they were. And then that was when the whole story had to come out. ‘Cause it was like a talent acquisition lady. And I had to tell her the story. I was like, "You know, this is what's happening. This is where, this is what I've just escaped from. This is what I'm from." And she's like, "Oh my gosh, let me see what I can do for you. I'm going to get you this." And then my manager, you know, that company, I'm not going to mention their name, you know, just because for, you know, I'm not going to expose their name or the people in that company, but they were my [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7222s) friends outside of the church.

They were my first real friends that I, when I landed back in my hometown that I knew, and I literally kind of cleaved to. And if it wasn't for those people in my life, they gave me that real first hand up on the ladder in my life. Like, you know, they, it was amazing from people from like my manager who kind of heard my story to her VP, to, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7252s) the VP now she's like, you know, amazingly supportive in my life. The CFO, you know, I helped out doing things here and around there, around the company and the company was around, like, I think like around 500 people and the CFO would give me his time once a month, like the CFO of this global organization would give me his time.

And anyway, I got the job. Like I was over the moon. I couldn't believe it. I have benefits. I actually had a salary again and it was above anything that I thought I would ever get. Like I was, even though the salary was lower, I was over the moon, but I needed it. Like I had to stay in the hotel for two weeks with $600. It doesn't go far like when you're trying to do meals every day and you're, you know, you still got to pay for your taxi cab and stuff. So anyway, I got the job at this company.

Yeah, I ended up moving to a bed and breakfast for another two weeks. And that's where I actually started my job. I did my onboarding, you know, everything was online then because of COVID. So I did my initial induction in the office. And then I went home and I worked for literally, I'm not kidding, you probably, the room was tiny. You wouldn't have got a double bed in there. And then it went into a bathroom. So I was trying to work in there off like this old clunky desk. And that's [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7339s) I started out, which was kind of an upgrade to me from, you know, couch surfing in somebody's living room.

But anyhow, I, yeah, I started off there. And then the same lady who I was renting the Airbnb off, she actually had a rental property with rooms. So I upgraded again. I moved into this room, which was a whole story in itself. ‘Cause it was kind of a bit of a pothouse in a way. One of the guys there was super like, yeah, he had a lot of mental issues [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7369s) would like threaten to murder people. And that was quite an experience. There was mice in my bedroom and I was just like, it was, it started to like suddenly flow out of control, but I was actually getting, you know, I was spending most of my time at work.

Like I would literally go in there. We had a key card and it was kind of odd to the people I worked with that I was there from like 6:00 AM in the morning until sometimes 8:00 at night. Or they were like, "What are you doing? Like, are you crazy? Do you not have a life?" And, you know, not in a [horrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7399s) way, but they were like, you know, they were trying to help me to understand a work-life balance because this is all he saw, but it was my safe space. It was my getaway from my life. Like I had to get away from my life because it was too much of a mess.

Anyway, from there, in July of 2021, I bought my, no, June of 2021, I bought my first vehicle. So I was pretty pumped about that. I got my first vehicle and a work colleague actually drove me up to the place. It was like an hour and a half away on a Saturday to go get my first vehicle. Like they, they knew my story and they were helping out. I'll cover off on this later, but that company, like they've treated me so well. Like they've given me, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7445s) raises, they've helped me out like no end and really loved me. Like there is, you know, it's an amazing experience, you know, when you have a company like that around you.

But anyway, so I got my first vehicle and then I actually, this was another weird part of the story. I joined up with another church, but you know what they often say about people who leave a cult is they're attracted to a cult environment. So I actually was, I was attracted to a bunch [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7475s) Christians who were actually part of a church that follow William Marrion Branham's teachings. So his name, yeah, his name is William Marrion Branham and they call him Brother Branham. And anyway, I joined onto this church and really nice people, you know, they again helped me. And I ended up living with one of the older guys in the church, renting his basement off him.

So I moved out of this house that was just opposite work. And I started living in this older guy's basement who was part of this William Marrion Branham church. Now I didn't really understand a lot about the teaching or the leadership of the church, but they broke me in very easy. And I actually ended up getting baptized in that church. You know, I wanted to put a stake in the ground. Like I wanted to give my life to Jesus properly and start my own walk with him without a bunch of, you know, a bunch of baloney. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7528s) so, yeah, I joined this church and then some really weird stuff started coming out of the woodwork.

Like I was like, "Oh my gosh, this just doesn't stack up." Like, you know, they believed things like obviously Cain and Abel, they believed that Cain was because Eve had intercourse with the serpent. So that was actually the serpent's son, like stuff like that. And it was like, I was like, "Yeah, [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7558s) no." So I ended up slowly like started quitting going to that church and I was honestly starting to get really despairing because I was like, "Is every church like this? Like, is everything, is everybody just totally crazy? Like, does everyone want to follow some old guy at the top who's kind of just controlling and half lost his marbles?"

But I was starting to despair pretty good and I was still living at this guy's house. So I started like not really going to church, which he was obviously going to church. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7588s) he was already starting to get a little bit grumpy with me. And then I actually had a work colleague. So a work colleague said to me, we talked a lot. And he said, "You know, on the radio this morning, I actually heard of AM700, this church called Rocky Mountain Calvary Chapel. And their young adults pastor was giving a sermon." He said it was really good. And he said, "So I called them up and said, 'Hey, do you have a young adults group? Because I know somebody you'd like to join.'" And the young [adults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7618s) pastor said, "Yeah, sure we do. We actually got one this Wednesday. Tell him to come along."

So I went along to this young adults. And this is how I met the church that I was with now. And I went to the young adults. And again, it was another super nerve-wracking experience. You know, this is, you're trying to get to know people all over again. And it takes a toll on you. And then I went to their first, I went to my first Sunday service there. And the amazing thing was that I walked into that church and I [sat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7654s) under my first sermon. I don't say sat under, but I sat under the teaching. I heard the first sermon. And my heart and my soul just said, "This is it." There was no mistake, no doubt that this was it.

It was purely teaching from the Bible. It was no man's interpretation or slant. It was no rules or like control or, you know, "This is how you should do it." It was no, "This is how [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7684s) going to earn your faith by works." It was just the pure, when it speaks about a pure mantle milk of the word, that's what it was. And I was surrounded by people who were, you know, loved me and wanted me to go do things with them. And it was like, you know, I got to know the young adults pastor more and more and he was the one who kind of really helped me work through things. But I started meeting with, like he's invested so much time into me, you know, on a weekly basis he'd meet with me to help me work through things.

But you know, it was the first time that I really was like, "I [found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7714s) it." Like it was an insane moment. And anyway, I carried on living at this guy's house, but I was like, I was actually praying. I was like, "You know, I found what I've really been looking for. And I believe this is, you know, you Lord. So don't take me away from that. If I lose my home, if I have to go live somewhere else, you make that clear." And literally it was like the next week I got home on a Wednesday night. ‘Cause I wasn't telling my landlord that I was doing this because I knew that he'd blow up because I was meant to be going to his church, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7744s) was very closely knit.

And so I didn't tell him. And then I got home one night and he just blew up with me, just blew up with me. He's like, "What are you doing just living here getting cheap rent, hanging out with your trash friends? Like all these people are trash that you're hanging out with and you know, they don't even, you don't even listen to the message," which is like the message of their church. And I was like, "Okay." I was like, and then I went to him the next day and said, "By the way, I found another place." I literally went on Kijiji in the first place that I found, which is actually [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7774s) ranch out near Aldersyde, you know, it's about kind of 35 minutes outside of Calgary.

I, you know, I spoke to the people there and said, "By the way, I've got another place." So then he started throwing his toys out of the buggy. You know, he said, "Right. Okay. Well, next month your rent goes up like an astronomical amount. You got to pay 350 every week for cleaning." Like he just started being an absolute jerk. So I was like, "Whatever, I'll be out of here before then." And so I, you know, we got a trailer and we got me shipped out of there. And I [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7805s) living on this ranch and going to church and, you know, it was beautiful. Like I was starting to really get my feedback under me after so long.

Like you have no idea even, I was still even sleeping rough up until that point. Like I didn't own a bed or anything, even if it's other guy's place, I was still, you know, I was still sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I really owned nothing. I have my vehicle and, but I wasn't, I've never been the type to, you know, just splash [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7835s) money when I'm, you know, I'm trying to build myself back up. So I'm still trying to, you know, build my savings back up or whatever else. So it was still pretty rough.

Anyway, I moved out here and out to this place and she was a rodeo lady, you know, she had been on, she was a barrel racer and, you know, her sister's into breakaway roping and she was, you know, she was on the circuit and everything else. And I, yeah, I was like, "Well, this is my world. I'm going to go riding and roping all day long. Like, this is just, you know, when I was done work, I was out there with the horses." She had four, five horses. So I was, you know, I was just living the dream out there on the ranch, you know, living in the basement and, you know, kind of slowly, you know, I was actually really starting to enjoy my life.

I was going to a church that I loved, was working through things with my young adults pastor. And then I was there from, again, they would have been, [end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7890s) of November, early December, 2021\. And they heard my story and they, they really embraced me. Like they, you know, they took me to their Christmas party and stuff like that because they knew I was alone, like every Christmas, like at Christmas time, I would just go into work or try and work. So try and get my mind off it because, you know, you're with nobody, you're totally, totally alone. And anyway, I was going to this church and actually in January, January 1st, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7920s) girl from the church added me on Facebook.

And I was really suspicious at that point. I'd tried dating since I'd left the church and I was complex. My story was complex. People were like, "Who is this guy?" I was, you know, I was behind the times. I was, you know, I wasn't up to speed and so many relationships went bad. Actually, I wrecked one myself, which is actually a pretty funny story. I've always been into big diesel trucks. I love horsepower that's diesel. And so I was dating this girl or we were getting to know each other. We hadn't actually quite started dating, but we were getting along really well. And this was like one of my, it was the first girl I really dated outside of the church or was getting to know.

And so actually, so I was, yeah, I took her out for a drive one night and we went to a place called Glenmore Reservoir here in Calgary. And we'd been at the reservoir and, you know, we'd spent the day there. And then on the evening I was driving her home and I was like, "Do you want to see something really cool?" ‘Cause I'm a country kid. I was like, "You know, this is really cool." So I tuned my truck up like no end, like that thing was just, you know, that thing was just chewing horsepower. And it, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=7995s) was, so I just pinned it, you know, I took her down one of the main stretches and just pinned that thing.

And I did it so as, you know, it had high performance injectors and it just rolled coal. Like the whole street behind us was just black and there were cars you just see in the black smoke. And I turned to her and I was like, you know, looking for congratulations kind of thing. And she just goes, "Obnoxious, totally obnoxious." So that was the end of that. So yet most dates were kind of going [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8025s) that at that point. So anyway, this girl added me on Facebook.

And so my first response to her was, "Who are you? What do you want?" Like I was kind of, I was kind of blunt and rude.

And actually, no, I'm going to take a step back. Like just before that, not long before I'd started dating, like trying to date other girls, I actually had a phone call with my mom because I was, it was just before they withdrew from me. So I was withdrawn from, I'm going to say September of 2021 or October of 2021\. I can't remember the exact time or date, but they withdrew from me just like they gave me a call on the computer and they were like, "You know, we have to withdraw from you because of blah, blah, blah." And I was like, "Yeah, whatever. Like just, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8069s) whatever. I don't care."

And they were like, "So is that it?" Because they were like expecting me to kind of be blubbing and, you know, really have. Then I was like, "Whatever is what it is. Like, so what?" And anyway, so I'd actually spoken to my mom around that same time and she's like, "I want to tell you something else." "Oh, what's that?" And she's like, "Did you know this girl's getting married?"

And all up until that point, until, you know, everything, I still wanted to marry her. And although I left the church and everything, I still was like, "If I can marry her, I'll go back." If I can, you know, and it wasn't God's plan for me, but that was clear, but I still had feelings for her. And she called me out and said, "Yeah, she's getting married." And I was like, like, I was absolutely furious. I was like, "Who to?" And she was getting [married](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8124s) to the son of the guy, the elder in Maple Creek. And she had been living with him and his family when she had been in Maple Creek.

Supposedly, you know, getting ready to get married to me, she had been living with this family and she was engaged to his eldest son. And I was furious. I was like, "You sneaky, sneaky, sneaky sons of guns. Like you absolute sneaky, yeah, whatever else it was." I was like, I couldn't believe it. I was like, "You, you know, everything and okay, yeah, we majorly screwed up, but now your son, are you kidding me?” [Like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8167s) and yeah, it makes you wonder what was going on when she was living there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8168s)

Exactly. I mean, and he rolls that way, that whole family rolls that way. I mean, yeah, a perpetrator belongs in this family. They all roll this way. They're so, they have this face that they put forward with a whole other life that goes on behind them, right? It's just such split personalities with them. Yeah.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8194s)

And actually it was funny, mom said to me that like this girl that I was dating, she was super materialistic. And actually my parents had said to me, they're very, very, you know, you got a very good way of sussing people out and they were like, she's not the girl for you. Like she's gonna drain you dry. But I still loved her and you know, I would have had her. But and I was committed to still, although I was outside, I was still committed to, you know, someday I wanted to marry her and you know, I've been intimate with her and I [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8224s) wanted her. But anyway, I heard this, but actually mom said to me, she's like, so this elder in the church, he has three sons. He's the lead of Maple Creek. Let's just put it out there. He's the lead of Maple Creek. He's got three sons and his second eldest son, she apparently had feelings for him.

But when he bought his house, it was very pathetic in comparison. And it is kind of pathetic in comparison to his elder brother's. So she ended up going, so the story goes, she ended up going, "Yeah, don't like his house as much because she's quite materialistic, I'll go for him." So she went for the next one up.

And yeah, they were married up and settled down like it was probably a year after I kind of left the UK or like left the, like it was, no, they were engaged long before that actually because I was still, yeah, they would have been engaged probably six months after.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8289s)

So you can't tell me that nothing happened when she was there. There is no way. Yeah.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8295s)

You're right. And like that, the whole thing was they were keeping me, you know what I kind of figured out later on. I was like, that's why there was no real reason for me suddenly not being able to come back. That's why there was no real reason for me suddenly being moved back out of the priest's house and into another rental property by myself there. That's why there was no real reason behind it, because they were trying to keep me out of the picture while she married him. And I was like, "Dirty, filthy scumbags, you absolute filthy dogs." And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8325s) anyway, she married him or whatever else.

But yeah, on January 1st, this girl sent me the message and then we started messaging back and forth. Like I was like, he was quite a bit younger than me and she said to me like, you know, we really started messaging and she was like, "Well…

**Richard Marsh**

So, so this is the girl from your new church?"

**Fergus Howard**

Yeah. I would just keep keeping it to “girl.” I should put girl one, girl two, girl three, but yeah, let's see if you can get even more. So, she, [uh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8355s) yeah, she, we were messaging back and forth and, you know, she kind of told me her age and then she said, "You know, someday, you know, when you're next to church, we should meet up." And I was like, "Yeah, sure."

And then I was like, "This is stupid. Like I'm totally done trying to, you know, get a spouse, get a wife, fall in love. Like, screw this. I want to be on the circuit. I want to be following the rodeo. Like I want to be, you know, someday I want to go down to Arizona and be in the rodeo down there." And so that was my dream. I wasn't really following this. Anyway, she, so I just ghosted her for a week. I was like, "You know, I don't, I'm not doing this." I just dropped the line and I didn't message her back.

And then, which she holds over my head till this day. And when I'm six foot under the ground, she'll be jumping on my grave saying, "Remember that time you ghosted me, and you've done it again,” not really, but she, yeah, she, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8411s) went to church one day and then I just dropped her a message. I was like, "So where were you at church today? I tried to meet you." This is like a week later after I hadn't spoken to her.

And then we started getting back into the communication. So that following Wednesday night, she was at the young adults, so we met up and we talked. And yeah, then I, you know, I got to know her and I got to know her family and we dated for a year and I proposed to her this February gone and we just got married last, uh, we just got married last weekend, not last weekend, the weekend before. Yeah. So she is now my wife. 

But yeah, that's [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8448s) main of my story really. And this is kind of where I am today, but all through that time, you know, even when I was in a relationship with my wife, Faith there was still times where the community were like trying to contact me and, you know, to the point that I just shut my email down. I, you know, I just got rid of the email that they knew and all the communication. 

But yeah, that's the main of my story. But yeah, it's funny. The one thing that I would, I still would love to do is, you know, go back to Maple Creek, see my, you know, see my uncles, see my family, but there's kind of, not only is there a lot of heartache there now, but there's also the fact that the girl that did the dirty on me is, you know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8490s) cannot believe how sneaky they got.

Like I seriously will never fathom that how they managed to keep me out of the picture long enough to get her to, you know, fall in love and, you know, or married out to this other guy. And I know one thing, I, you know, I do stand to be corrected, but I do not believe that she truly loved him when she married him. ‘Cause I know one thing that family have a lot of kids and they love having kids. And the one thing Rilla never wanted, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8520s) it was one thing that she would, she would not get married on the basis that she had to have children. She did not want children. Well, she's got, she's just, you know, she, in March, she had a child. So I know that that was not the perfect marriage for her, but yeah, that's kind of my story.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8542s)

So one question, your file back in 2009, when you went to England, would he have been the lead that wrote that file?

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8550s)

Uh, I don't actually know who wrote that file at that point in time. Like I don't actually know. There was a lot of people involved. I more know the receiving end, but yes, he would have definitely been in, he would definitely been a part of it. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8569s)

That's what I thought. Yeah, it's, not saying his name, but I can tell you for the last 30 years, there's one sneaky, slimy snake and it's still the same person.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8577s)

Exactly. That's what I was just gonna say. They are, they're so...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8582s)

Richard's laughing at us, but it is the absolute honest truth. There is a, oh that...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8586s)

That family is so, that family is just so, so, it's how they've been able to cover up, yeah, that's how they've been able to cover up my perpetrator in there this whole, I think there's so, the face that they put forward is not who they are and they're very good at maneuvering both sides of the world. They would have had you convince Fergus that you were top priority, first priority, and all these things that they're helping you do. But in [behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8616s) the scenes, what about a whole other world that was going on?

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8620s)

Oh, yeah. And you could kind of see that happening. Like you could, there was, you know, talk about two-faced, you know, it was, or speaking with forked tongue. But yeah, I'm sorry, kind of, I guess, going back a little bit. Yeah, Faith and I got married and we're actually living on a, we live on a ranch now in Rocky View County. So we're not in Aldersyde anymore, but we've honestly, we're living the life right now. So that doesn't end, but it's kind of nice sometimes to just kind of, you know, wave the one finger salute back at the crowd and [say,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8650s) "Hey, this is where we're at."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8652s)

But I think this is like, this is the whole inspiration. It can be done. Don't let people run over you and it can be done.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8662s)

One thing I want to add to that as well is like, not only was I totally, utterly bankrupt, like I was, I was crushed and totally on my own. It's not like I'd even been planning to leave the community. I just did it. And you know, a lot of people plan it. They know friends, they have people that kind of draw them out and super helpful, but even, even like this, it can be done. But one thing that actually I forgot to say that is just to the point of how brainwashed you can become as a human.

In that church, now looking back, I can see how brainwashed I was. Because one of the things that I was told when they got wind in the UK that I was planning to leave, to try my best to make my life outside the church, they had a little priestly meeting with me. And one of the guys said to me,

 "If you leave the church, it will not be a matter of if, but it'll be a matter of when you end up in jail because of the type of person you are, the history you've had and who you are."

 [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8722s) then you're like, when you look back, you're like, "Okay, this fear mongering is taught on a way lesser scale all the way through, you know, the community." And you know what? I was so brainwashed by that. I believed it. I lived in fear of it after I left for so long.

It was, you know, it was up until like, it would have been until like November of 2021 that I was watching every single jail documentary that I could get my hands on because I wanted to understand what prison was like. I wanted to understand what jail was like because I knew that's where I was going to end up. I was working out like crazy because I knew that I didn't stand a chance since I had, you know, in clink. So it was, that's how brainwashed and how like, you know, scaremongered into things I was.

But it is no, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8773s) know, looking back at the insane loneliness you go through and the same turmoil and hurt and rending from your family, especially being like the one who came out from your family and them still being in and like not really, not having, let alone a geographical location, closeness geographically, but a closeness in that kind of that link with your family totally torn. I would honestly not wish this journey on my worst enemy.

 It's, is it a story to tell? Yeah. And is it when you look at some of those like on YouTube, like polygamist escape videos and stuff like that, you're like, "Yeah, done that." But it's, you wouldn't truly wish it on your worst enemy, but it can be done. And the funny thing is, there's actually more helping hands and genuine hearts that will [help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8825s) you out here when they hear your story than you're ever told in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8829s)

You're told that these people are on the road to hell and they're this and they're that. But it says that God weighs the hearts. And I've had so many kind hearts around me that, you know, people in my life that have helped me make this journey that, you know, I couldn't have done without them. And that's what people are going to take out of this podcast. It's those people that are still in there that could be in a predicament that you are in, knowing that they have to leave, knowing that they have to leave behind money, knowing that they have to take this leap of faith into this world of fear when really it's not. It's a world that has a ton of helping hands to it. Yeah. Go ahead, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8873s)

Yeah, I was just going to ask, there must have been some point. I mean, when you're brought up in the church, in the brethren system, you believe it is the church and that there is no other church and that Bruce Hales is the man of God and is your connection with God.

And it's a big, it's a huge milestone in leaving when you realize that that's not the case. When did that moment come for you when you realized that, you know, the brethren are a church or at least a religion or a cult, but they're no longer *the* church and that you don't have to fear for your soul? You know, you're not going to go to hell just because you leave the brethren. In fact, you might go to hell just for staying [there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8920s) When did that point come for you?

### **Fergus Howard**

That's a very interesting question. Honestly, it was a process over time. Like it didn't happen overnight. It was like, you know, it was, as my young adults pastor referred to it, it was like God turning over that stone in my life and like slowly dispersing all the dirt that was there. And a lot of it happened as I attended my, you know, the church teachings that I was under and I was like, "But so, you know, that wasn't true what I believed then and grace isn't [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8953s) that and God isn't like this." Like I lived in fear of God in my life as this ogre who was waiting to come down on me like a freight train. Like he was just wait, I was on the tracks and he was just going to come down on me when I messed up.

And I did live in fear of my salvation and, you know, I got to the point of despair, especially in the early days of when I left because you're in such turmoil of, "Have I made the right decision? What have I done?" Not only like your life, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=8983s) your, you know, your choices as to your moral choices. You know, that my whole goal or whole desire was to literally go and commit suicide somewhere. And they found my car in the morning because I was in so much turmoil as to whether I'd made the right decision. But, you know, as you feel it scraped away, as you actually see the Bible for what it is taught the way it should be taught. You get to know God for the God he is, not the God that some [man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9013s) perceives him to be and, you know, interpret him to you as.

And you're not even allowed to have your real own interpretation of, not an own interpretation because God is who he is, but you're taught to rely solely on what that man says and every word is right. But it's not. It's your personal, personal link with Jesus. That is, and that's where you understand who he is. But if, you know, that scraping, that took time. That [took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9043s) a long time. I would say, you know, it would have been, I was still probably going through that process, you know, up into early 2021\. Sorry, early 2022, I was still going through that process of, you know, realizing that I had made the right choice and that it wasn't the only position, but it took a long time.

### **Richard Marsh**

Yeah, that's interesting because I mean the church, the brethren centers very, very much personally on Bruce Hales as the Man of God. And I imagine it was a kind of a quite a shocking thing for you when you found that message from him saying, you know, "He's totally bad, let him [stew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9093s) in his own juice." That must have been a sort of a watershed moment where you thought, "Well, if this is the man of God, I'm done for, I'm finished." Or maybe he's not, and maybe this whole thing is an illusion, and I can move beyond it.

### **Fergus Howard**

Well, that was when I really truly realized the position was wrong, because I, you know, and again, I have to be very careful, because there are still things that are taught within that church and, you know, to Cheryl's point earlier is exposing maybe the system and like what is going on inside that that is [clothed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9126s) as a church. It's, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9129s)

Yeah, but the devil is very smart.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9130s)

When he does something, you know, he's always going to throw in little tidbits that are right and absolutely right. So as you did, there's always that point where there's confusion and that's, he's the master of confusion. That's exactly what there is there. But really when Bruce Hales rejected me, God was walking beside me. And he was opening doors when Bruce and the brethren were closing doors. And, you know, one thing to your points there that you brought up, one thing that came up in a church meeting not long [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9161s) I really started, you know, I actually got kicked out of Worcestershire and moved to Coventry was somebody said in one of the church meetings that, and it was believed that you could only come to Jesus through Paul. And that in itself is an absolute blasphemous statement because there is only one mediator.

### **Richard Marsh**

Where to explain to, explain to outsiders, when the brethren say Paul, they are referring to the apostle Paul, but they actually mean Bruce Hales, who they consider to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9191s) effectively the reincarnation of Paul, the apostle.

### **Fergus Howard**

Yeah. And actually just added to that, like last piece, and it was funny when you say, like you were kind of giving a bit of a definition there of how Paul, or sorry, Bruce Hales, the leader is so, you know, is almost seen above God in a way in the church. And they'll never ever admit to this, but it's true. And, you know, I actually figured this out once because I would [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9221s) blaspheme God. Like it was in my heart that I had a holy fear of God and I was not going to blaspheme him. I have my moments of arguing with him and wrestling with him and going through my turmoil.

But I remember being in the school in the UK where they went through a season of thinking it was cool to blaspheme. And so the brethren children would blaspheme. And I have never heard blasphemy like it. Like some of the things that they were saying were just awful. Like and my heart was [hurting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9251s) Like and I was scared. And, you know, I was hearing these things and I was like, "I'm not having a part to do with this." And because I was who I was, I turned around one day and I was like, "So what if I started blaspheming Bruce Hales? What if I said Bruce Hales, F this, F that?" And I did because I was in that stage of life. I was, you know, I kind of tore my head off about Bruce Hales and I was in the soup, man. Like all these kids turned against me. The parents got to know about it. The priest got to know about what I'd said because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9282s) had said this about Bruce Hales and yet they were allowed to say it about God and nothing was really done. Just a little slap over the wrist.

### **Richard Marsh**

Well, it's really interesting you say that because I saw the very beginning of that process maybe a year before I left. It was a bit of an eye-opening moment for me because I heard a young brother who was a respectable and looked up to young brother telling some long-winded joke about, you know, it's one of these jokes about when you go to heaven and this and that. And he was, Jesus came into the [joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9312s) several times. And I was really puzzled because I sort of brought up, you don't joke about things like that. And then it occurred to me, well, no one would ever joke about Bruce Hales. No one would ever joke about Bruce Hales. And yet now you're telling me that this has now moved to the stage where they will blaspheme and use God's name in vain, but they'll never, ever speak ill of Bruce Hales. I mean, that just tells you everything, doesn't it? It's a whole thing in a nutshell. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9345s) I think that's shocking, but fascinating.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9350s)

Absolutely powerful statement. Yeah.

### [**Fergus Howard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9354s)

Yeah. No, it is, it's incredible. Like your heart bleeds for a lot of the people in that church though, with genuine hearts because they don't realize how they're being taken. Exactly. Yeah. They don't. And you tell me that, that, you know, Gareth and Bruce have made their money by innocent, hardworking means. I'm not going to believe you in a million years. It doesn't make sense. And actually, if you look at all the other leaders [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9386s) until that point, why weren't they so successful? It doesn't stack up. And there's no way that a guy... Well, there's not no way, but it's a very slim chance that a guy like Gareth, who is in an office fit-out company has made his millions by the time he's 30\. Billions. Billions. Yeah, it's a competitive industry. It's not an [easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9416s) industry to break into. It's a very, very competitive market. And even if you do your research, which I did kind of briefly in the kind of Australia, Sydney area, it's still competitive. You've got to have funding from somewhere. Like yes, it doesn't make, you know, but they suck it up. Like this guy's got their good at heart. He's got nothing good at heart. Yeah, he's got his own good at heart. Yeah, or what passes for a heart.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9445s)

Thank you so much Fergus for joining us. I think that was a very well-rounded and full podcast that is giving a lot of tools to a lot of people. You know, I just commend you. I commend you for being able to come on and be honest and truthful and vulnerable and everything that you went through. It was a lot of insight and especially from someone who is a recent leaver, right? Like I mean this isn't just something that's, you know, was 10 years ago. This [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9475s) something that's very recent. So it's good. It's good to have those people that have had the most recent exposure to be able to come on and give their experiences. So we're very grateful for that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3bGmBx_JU&t=9485s)

Yeah, huge respect to you, Fergus. And, you know, it takes a lot of courage to get on here and speak about all these things. But it's hugely, it's an enormous help to everyone who's trying to feel their way into escaping from that system. So on behalf of all of us, thank you very much. We really appreciate it.

### **Fergus Howard**

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
