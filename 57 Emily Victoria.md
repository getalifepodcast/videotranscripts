## Summary

Are you thinking of joining the PBCC?
In 2014, the PBCC, in their charity commisions review, declared that they would allow outside members to join and attend their meetings. Emily Victoria gave up her friends and family, got rid of her TV, jewelry, wore dresses and headbands, and sincerely wanted to join the PBCC and reunite with her boyfriend that wanted to marry her. Unfortunately, she was denied in every way and cut off of contact from the love of her life. Could it be that her boyfriend's family was looked down on, or was it the sneering priests that thought she was a joke? Either way, the PBCC are showing the public they aren't holding to their agreements they laid out with the Charities Commision. Join Emily as she shares her meeting with the priests, screenshots of their messages, and heartwrenching audio of her emotional pain after being denied what she wholeheartedly gave everything for. Can the Charity Comission hold the PBCC accountable for their misuse of their charity status? We certainly hope so!

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=9s)

Welcome to another episode of the Get-A-Life Podcast. We are joined by Cheryl and Abby. And our special guest today is Emily, who is going to tell us her story about her interactions with someone from inside the PBCC who was... she was essentially dating. So I'll hand over now to Emily to tell us her story. Welcome, Emily.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=34s)

Thank you. So I was working for a PBCC company. I started in January and I met this boy and we quickly became friends, and he started telling me about what life was like in the PBCC. Eventually, we started dating each other and it was pretty casual at first until he got to the point [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=65s) he said, "Hey, actually for the right girl, I would consider leaving." And that kind of changed the dynamic of our relationship and made it a lot more serious.

So we started discussing how he could leave and that he would move in with me, things like that. And then eventually his priests got suspicious about us. I ended up getting sacked from my job. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=95s) called him into a meeting and he said that he wanted to leave and they convinced him not to. He sent me a letter breaking up with me and blocked me on the spot. And so that was over.

Then for the next six to nine months, we stayed in contact. So he would block me one day and then unblock me the next. He would say, "I really [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=125s) to come out, I want to be with you, I love you." And then he'd have a meeting with his priests again and he would say, "I need to get right, you're wrong, I can't be with you, I need to do right by my community." He blocked me again.

And then we met up again eventually and he got shut up for that. He got shut up for four months in total. And then when he got back [in,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=155s) he told me, and from then we spoke kind of sporadically and it ended a few months ago.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=164s)

So how serious did it get? Like when you were dating, how serious were you guys?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=174s)

I'd say we were really serious. I mean we worked together, we sat next to each other, so we'd spend all day with each other. Even at work, we would keep texting each other. And then when we finished work, he would wait for his family to fall asleep and then he would drive to come see me and spend all night with me and go back to work without having slept at all. We obviously spoke about him moving in with me once he had [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=205s) the brethren. So yeah, he was quite keen on the idea of marrying me as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=213s)

And at this point all along, he was planning on leaving. Had the subject ever been brought up maybe about you joining them?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=227s)

Him leaving came up on his own. I didn't want to influence him because I knew it was a huge decision that had to come from him, and I kind of went along with that once I knew he was sure.

In respect for me joining, that was at the point when we had got caught and it was obvious he didn't have the strength to leave. And I thought to myself, "Well, how can I ask you to leave for me if I'm not willing to join for you?" So I said, "Well, you know, should I try?" And he wanted me to, and he kind of coached me on how to get in contact with the elders, what to say in any of the meetings and the communication, [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=270s) the hopes that I would be able to go in and then marry him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=274s)

And did you get a hold of the elders, the priests? Did they ever contact you or did you ever get in contact with them?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=283s)

Yeah, I did. So at this point, I had been sacked from my job and luckily the CEO of the company I worked for was also an elder for the church. So I emailed him as if I was talking about a work-related thing and then once I got a hold of him on the phone is when I said, "Hey, I want to join."

So that continued with a lot of back and forth of me chasing him, sending him WhatsApps all the time. He kind of fogged me off a lot, but eventually, it did lead to us meeting in person.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=317s)

And what was that meeting like? So interesting to hear what it would be like as an outsider trying to get in because it's unheard of, right? Like you don't hear people joining ever, right? I mean, even though that they state that they're a mainstream Christian church, they are a very closed cult that, I mean, you would probably have to jump over a lot of hurdles I would imagine to try and get in. What was that like for you?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=345s)

Yeah, so when I met with them, it was two elders and just me. I could tell that they were very shocked that I wanted to and they were very careful in what they were saying. I could tell they didn't want to slip up and say the wrong thing, but ultimately they were quite condescending and rude to me. They definitely spoke down to me [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=376s) looked down on me as well.

I just got this overall sense that they were quite annoyed that they've had to take time out of their precious day to talk to this, you know, silly girl that wants to join. And it was very much a, "How can we get rid of her as soon as possible so we don't have to do this again?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=395s)

Yeah, what kind of things did they say where it made you feel like they were talking down to you?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=402s)

So they asked me where I was from and what my family life was like. And when I was sort of explaining that, one of the elders kept sort of laughing to himself or smirking. And as well, he asked me if I knew my Bible and I said, "No, you know, I'm new to reading it." And he did actually laugh at me and I think he said, "Oh, figures." [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=432s) yeah, just they kept sharing looks amongst each other and there was just a vibe that I really wasn't welcome. Yeah, you're a laughing stock, I suppose.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=451s)

Yeah. How long did you get to actually sit with them?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=456s)

It was about 30 minutes. I was late to the meeting, so they really tried to rush me because it wasn't going to be long after that people would have met at the church. So I think they wanted me gone before everyone started to come in for their worship that day.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D480s)

So your meeting was done at the meeting hall?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D483s)

No, it was done at the company, but the meeting hall was next door.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=485s)

Oh, I see. Okay, I gotcha. Yeah, yeah. Did you believe, like was there a part of you that believed that you'd be able to get into this church?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=495s)

I think deep down I knew that I wasn't going to, but I was trying to convince myself that I could do it. I was so passionate about it and I didn't care what anyone said. Like, you know, Gilli really tried to convince me not to and I was like, "I don't care, I'm doing this. I don't care about what anyone says." But after that meeting, it's when I knew, like, there's no way I'm getting into this.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=521s)

Do you think that looking back, do you think it was a bit cruel of the guy that you were dating to give you some inkling that you may join? Do you think it was a bit cruel of him?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=535s)

I think he genuinely thought I could join. I don't think he knew, well, he doesn't know what it is actually like. And he's very kind of, he thinks it's, you know, a great place to be and he doesn't know what goes on on the outside of it. So I think he genuinely thought I could.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=560s)

Yeah, it's quite naive because in, you know, the past hundred years, probably the only way that you can actually get in there is either if you're born into it or if someone, like my mum, she left the brethren, married my dad, and then she wanted to come back. That's the only way my dad could actually come in. Like, I only know of a [handful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=591s) of cases in the last, you know, 20, 25, 30 years that that's actually happened. I could count on one hand.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=600s)

So there was someone that a brethren that worked at this company that he'd done the same. He left, married a girl who actually also worked there, and then came back with her, and I think they had a few kids. So this boy I was dating had spoken to him, so it kind of felt like he thought, "Oh, it'll be easy because this person did it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=622s)

Yeah, and that's how I'm hearing this, is that this boy that you were dating, because love does crazy things, right? It does. Like when your heart yearns for someone, you're going to do anything and you're going to believe anything to be able to be together with that person. So I could see how he would hope. And if he's reached out to someone that was able to do it, right? I could see how he would have had that belief.

And you know, honestly, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=653s) any of these people that are in there and they're reading the articles that are being printed or they're keeping up to date with what's happening out here, they are very firm on the fact that they're this mainstream Christian church and that they are not this closed, exclusive sect that we are all painting them to be, right?

So I could see how there would be this part of him that would feel maybe something's changed, maybe this could happen, right? It just really [goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=683s) to show you though, the picture that they paint themselves in articles and in reporters' eyes and in the eyes of their interactions that they have in the public does not match something like what you're talking about, right? And that's the sad situation, because if it was a mainstream Christian church, there would have been no problem with you joining and marrying the love of your life.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=708s)

Yeah, exactly. I do remember having a few conversations with this boy and him sort of trying to sell it to me of like, "Yeah, you know, it's great, it's a community, everyone loves each other, we're all there for each other. You know, we have a charity, we do charity work. And you know, my dad's such a good guy. You know, we pick up people that need lifts and, you know, he's so great." And it's like, you really don't [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=738s) anything, do you?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=742s)

They're so naive, bless them. But the whole marriage thing, you know, as a church, like we go to a church now and marriage is actually a godly thing. So for them to even reject the fact that you wanted to marry him, like they're actually rejecting something that's godly.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=765s)

Yeah, so with the elders, I only met with them the once, so I didn't have the opportunity to say that me and this boy were dating. We didn't really get to that point and I don't know if it really would have made much odds if I had said that. But at that point, he was convinced that we should have hidden the fact that we wanted to be together. I think he was kind of convinced that if I did get in, then if they knew I had the intention [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=795s) being with him, they would kind of punish us and wouldn't allow us ever to be together. So it had to be hidden until I was in.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D802s)

Makes sense. Yeah, come back to your comment about you'd obviously based it on, or he based it on someone else's experience. And obviously, I know we had quite a lot of conversations about this at the time. But it was, I think if I'm right in saying that the person that you were basing it on was from someone that was of, shall we say, a higher-ranking family.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=831s)

Yeah, that's right.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=832s)

Yeah. And it just highlights the different ways people are treated, depending on what their surname is and what their status is in there, because essentially you were in exactly the same situation, but it, you know, it just wasn't even entertained.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=854s)

Yeah, so there was a point where we were talking about him leaving, us getting married, and then joining together. And he was really scared. He was like, "Look, I'm just not a good enough person in there. They won't want me back if I leave and that's a huge risk for us to take." And he was also pretty convinced that our marriage wouldn't mean anything to them unless we had children. And he was like, "I don't want to just have a kid just to bring you in. Like, that's not fair." And that's not something I was willing to do either. So we kind of just left that [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=884s) there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=885s)

So I'm gathering that he was not high up in the hierarchy in there. He was more of one of the lower down families.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=895s)

Yeah, that's right. Very much so.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=900s)

Wow, which is, you know, it's just so sad that someone else with a better surname will get a far better treatment and their situation looked at more positively, just purely because of what their surname is and who their parents are.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=923s)

And how rich they are.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=925s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=926s)

I remember him saying, this is when we were just friends, he was saying that he felt like he would never be able to find anyone or get married because he said his eldest brother was like the golden boy in the family and he really struggles, he struggled to get married. And he was like, "You know, I've messed up already. You know, I've already been in trouble. No one is gonna want to marry me. Like, my life is over in here." And he [especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=957s) felt that after he had been shut up because he was like, "You know, I'm dirty now. I've been touched by a worldly. There's no way I'll ever find love. That's it now."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D968s)

That's so sad. I want to go back to the priests again because to me, the priest visit was a pivotal decision. To me, it was the make or break in all of this, whether he was able to leave, because they would have convinced him, right? I mean, we already know that the priests were, you know, caught on to the situation and were convincing him to let you go. But to me, the priests were the actual fulcrum of what was going to happen in this situation.

Do you think at any moment, like I know that you said that you felt that they talked down to you, but do you think there was any moment in there where you felt that they sincerely were listening to you? Or do you think they just wrote this all off as a joke?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1017s)

It's hard to say because one of the elders, the one who was the CEO, I knew him a little bit. He was a lot nicer to me and I don't know if it was a case of like good cop, bad cop situation, but he did compliment me a few times. He said it was really rare to see someone that, you know, had turned to Christ and that my devotion was very admirable. And he was like, "You know, keep at it. It is very inspiring to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1047s) someone so young have this love of God."

And I feel like that felt genuine to me. And I think I did get the sense that if it were just him, he probably would have tried to help me. He has a really good relationship with this boy and I feel like he wanted to help him too because he has helped him out in the past with giving him a job and things like that. But [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1077s) other priest, he was the one who was really quite rude. So I think it probably was more he was in charge and the other one was just along with it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1089s)

Yeah, yeah. And I mean, that's just sad. It is sad. I mean, all of us ex-members can sit outside here and say, "You know, you dodged a bullet." We can say that, right? And we can say that, you know what, you don't want to be in there. But that's the point of this. This isn't the whole principle of why we're doing what we're doing on this podcast, is to really show here's somebody young who is mostly willing to [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1120s) up absolutely everything to join and they denied it, right?

Like that choice, they took your choice away at a very pivotal moment in your life. And that is what I think the Charities Commission needs to know about. I think it's just they're not following what they've been set out that they said they would do since they lost their charity status back in, when was that, 2012? I think it was 2012\. Yeah, because [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1150s) the point. You are willing to give up everything to be able to go and do what they said to do. And here you sit down with two priests and they wrote you off.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1164s)

Yeah. So, you know, the thing I struggled with at the time is that it was a real sense of rejection. But, you know, I'd spoken to this boy and he had said, "You know, there's a lot more men in there than women." So I was thinking like, "Well, if you need women in there, and I'm sure they kind of needed like, you know, fresh blood in a way, because I know that the bloodlines have kind of crossed a little bit and they're having problems with that a lot." Yeah, I was like, well, this boy, just two [cousins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1194s) wanted to marry each other and I was like, "Hang on a minute, that's not allowed." But yeah, I got the sense of like, why won't you let me in? Like if you think, "Hey, this person wants to leave, but he'll stay if she comes in," surely that's easy. You know, we would have got married, had a few kids, and then he wouldn't be a problem anymore to them and they'd have an easier life of not having to watch him all the time. I just didn't understand their choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1221s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1222s)

So Cheryl, you touched on the Charity Commission thing and going back to my point of it possibly being a bit cruel to give you an inkling of being able to join. I myself, the wool was pulled over my eyes because I believed that when the review and the Charity Commission matter, as they called it, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1252s) going on, I believed everything had changed. Like if you left, you'd be able to contact your family. If people wanted to come in, they could, because that is what was, that was the picture that was painted to us, to all the young people.

And then the charity was introduced, which started some form of interaction between inside and outside. And so I believed everything had changed. Now I know it completely has not. But maybe that's where the naivety on his part came from, in that you could join. Yeah, because [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1302s) what they painted to us. And I don't think the Charity Commission realized that actually, well, they're starting to realize, but I don't think they fully realize that actually nothing's changed.

The other question I have is, on what basis were you actually sacked from your job? Do you think it could be classed as unfair dismissal if you took it to an employment tribunal?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1327s)

No, because I was still on probation, so they just ended the probation. So you don't really get any kind of grounds with that. I did look into it at the time because I was pissed off about it, but yeah, you just don't get any rights.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1346s)

Yeah, what was it, I mean, yeah, obviously you don't have any rights on probation, but what was their actual reason? What did they tell you, why did they tell you that your probation wasn't continuing?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1358s)

It was quite an awkward meeting, actually. So my manager, he was the one that was kind of realizing that me and him were talking to each other and kept telling us off. He was very nervous, like I've never seen him shake so much. He kept having to swallow as well as he was talking. Like, "Are you having a nervous breakdown? Are you okay?"

But I think he knew it wasn't fair and it was wrong. But he literally just said, "[Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1388s) this isn't working out, is it?" And I was like, "Excuse me, what? I've taken on two jobs here because you've got rid of another girl. You know, I get on with everyone, it's fine. What is your problem?" And he was just like, "Yeah, the board has just decided that you're not fit, so I'm sorry, you can collect your stuff and go." And that was that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1409s)

Wow. Shocking. Well, and they're Christians.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1417s)

Yeah, you know what, I actually had a conversation with someone this morning and we got into the conversation about again, how they paint their picture to the outside, right? Where there's this mainstream Christian church, they use the word "Christian," they have "Christian values," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you go back to actually what you're taught inside there, right, they don't use that word inside there.

Like, they didn't when I was in there. I don't know when you guys were in there, but that word "Christianity" wasn't really used. Like, to me, they didn't call themselves Christians inside there. What it is, is that you're in a holy fellowship with God's son, right? And they believe [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1459s) you're sovereignly placed in this holy fellowship with God's son. And if you give up that right, that's why they withdraw from you, right? Is because you should not give up that position.

But it's all about, it's literally just all about following the man of God. You don't, like, I went to other Christian churches after I left and it was just so different, the way that people talk, the way that it was presented than when I was in there. And then this girl I was just talking to this morning was just mentioning to [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1495s) that we've got to quit calling them Christians because they don't, they just present that. But when you're inside there, that word is not used. Like, was that word used when you were in there, Abby and Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D1507s)

Barely. Yeah, I mean, but yeah, again, barely. It would occasionally come up, but certainly not, yeah, like you say, it would have been all about the fellowship, the testimony, everything else.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1519s)

Exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D1520s)

Right. Man, it's, I guess I just, I take this back to your story again, Emily, is that they have this superiority about them, thinking again that they are the top. And why would they just take someone off the street? I think it was a real test. Like your situation, Emily, was a huge test for them to see if they had changed, right?

And so hearing your story and hearing how [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1552s) explain it, you really see that they have not changed. They have not taken the review that they had back in 2012 to heart. And like, you were one of the sweetest people I've ever spoken to. And why, it's just, it just doesn't make sense why they wouldn't have allowed you in there. It just doesn't make sense to me.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D1574s)

You sound more committed than me, gal. I mean, that's not hard, but yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1581s)

It's true what you were saying, Cheryl. You know, you walk into any church, you don't have to have a meeting with the elders before you go in. Yeah, where does that come from?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1598s)

Like, that's what I mean. You should have just been able to start showing up. You shouldn't have even had to meet with elders. It should have been, if they are an open mainstream Christian church that doesn't have to pay taxes on their properties of the churches, doesn't have to pay taxes on all these things, those church services should be open to the public. Because that is why you get your charity status.

I've had a conversation with another ex-member on this, that we should be able to just walk up and be like, walk in like any other normal church. If you're going to have closed doors and you're going to not allow people to join, you should not get free taxes. You should not be able to have your taxes wiped away on all of those church properties. [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1645s) if that's the case, I should be able to just open something up in my basement and not have to pay taxes on my house.

So here's the thing that got me riled up about the whole thing with you, Emily, is because they freaking took your choice away on such a pivotal moment of your life. Like, I'm a sucker for love. I am a sucker for a story like yours. I really am. It just, I get so invested in it and it breaks my heart that that choice was taken away from you. And now you, I mean, yes, you've had time to get over it, but [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1682s) shouldn't have been.

If they are who they say they are, and because they have the charity status that they have, this should not have been an issue. And when you sat down with those priests, it should have been, "Yes, we welcome you. You want to learn about the Bible, you want to learn about Christ's teaching, we welcome you with open arms. Come on in." That's how it should have been if they have been really repairing the damage they did pre-review, [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1713s) they got the charity status taken away. Yeah, yeah, it's not right. It's just not right because this is your heart. This is your heart we're dealing with.

So I want to read to you, this is what was one of the amendments for the Preston Down Trust that the PBCC agreed to uphold. Number one: 

"The services of worship conducted in each gospel hall included in the property of the trust, other than the Lord's supper and services convened for a particular family or by a visiting elder minister, [servant,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1743s) or evangelist for the benefit of a congregation gathering by way of special invitation, should be open to all properly disposed persons who wish to be present and observe such worship."

"Properly disposed persons are members of the public, whether members of the brethren or not, who, one, respect the gospel hall as a sacred place, two, do not threaten the safety or privacy of the assembly, and three, come to the service in a spirit of gravity, genuinely wishing to learn from the teachings that are given there."

"[Two,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1774s) we should ensure that a gospel hall in every locality displays prominently outside its premises a sign indicating how persons from outside the community, including former brethren, can attend a hall for worship. Three, we should offer to people who attend our gospel halls for worship from outside the community, including former brethren, the opportunity to better understand our faith and services through literature or in person."

So what I have to ask you, Emily, [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1804s) you genuinely wanting to learn the teachings of the PBCC?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1808s)

Yeah, yeah, I did. So when they said to me about, you know, I had to read Paul's writings, I had no idea what that was. So, you know, I asked them for mentorship because I was like, "Yeah, I have no idea what I'm doing or what any of this is and I'd like some guidance. Yes, I can read it on my own, but I'm not gonna understand it." But yeah, they didn't give that to me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1834s)

And you understood that their meeting halls were a sacred place. You weren't a threat to them.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1840s)

Yeah. No, not at all. I did say to them, like, "You know, I would sit in on a meeting, even if it's like, I just sit in the back. You know, you have people guard me if you want. Like, I just want to see kind of what it's like and if it would be for me." But they just completely ignored that when I said about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1861s)

Yeah. See, they're just not, they're not adhering to what they said that they were going to do when they got their charity status back. Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1869s)

And you know, if you had gone in, it would have all been edited for a public audience. So they say. So the people that would be preaching, because they normally go to, well, in the old days it would have been at five o'clock, I don't know what it is now, and they would say to the preachers, "We have a member of the public coming in, you're not to mention Bruce Hales's name in your preaching. This has got to be a gospel preaching."

[Now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1899s) it's a gospel preaching anyway, so why do you even need to say that to the people that would be preaching, to not mention Bruce Hales's name? Because they put Bruce Hales up with Jesus. So it would have all been edited for a public audience anyway. I just feel she should have been allowed to get in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1922s)

100%. Yeah. I'll attach a copy of the Preston Down Trust, the whole, everything that it contains. And it's really good for those of you that are in there to look through it and realize you have a lot more freedom than what you're being given right now.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1939s)

And anybody over the age of 18 is supposed to have their own copy rather than have just seen it once and signed it and given it back.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1951s)

That was what the agreement was.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D1953s)

The agreement with the "Living Our Beliefs" or whatever the document is called. The agreement was that everybody over 18 is supposed to have a copy and keep it. What the peeps actually did was, it was read out, one copy was given to each household which was told they had to read it and then give it back.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1978s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1978s)

Nobody has actually got, no, everybody over the age of 18 is supposed to have a personal copy of it. Nobody over the age of 18 has actually got their own copy.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1990s)

I've never seen, I know.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=1991s)

I know this because I challenged my own parents on it and they haven't got one because they had to, they were allowed to see it once and were told to give it back because they don't want people to read it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2004s)

Asked us for it because he didn't have it and he said the exact same thing, that they had to give it back. I'll attach it into the comments and you all can download it, print it off, and keep a copy hidden somewhere. And then when you are having your priestly visits and get questions on things that you've seen inside here that you're allowed to do, show it to them. And if they still don't let you do it, contact us.

I want to go back to, I want to just go back to your relationship with this guy. How invested were you? Like, I want you to get really, like, how invested were you in this?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2044s)

Very. I think it's the most thing I was committed to, to be honest. So I told all my family and friends about it. I was like, "Look, I'm not gonna be able to speak to you anymore once I join." I started limiting contact with people just so I could get used to the transition for about three months when I was trying to get in. I was only wearing dresses and a headband because I was like, "Yeah, I took all my jewelry out."

I was like, "I [need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2074s) to start living in this lifestyle now so I can get used to it and it's not going to be a shock." You know, I was reading the Bible every night just to try and get an understanding of how these meetings are going to go. I didn't use my TV. Just any rule I could try to follow, I did.

And you know, I was trying to contact the priests like every three days. So I was constantly on their case of like, "Hey, when can we meet? Hey, I tried to call you. [Hey,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2104s) what's going on?" I tried my absolute hardest.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2110s)

Wow. I didn't realize you were that invested where you've actually told your family. We have some screenshots here of your messages with the priest. Maybe just walk us through this. So these are some messages that you've had between you and the priest.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2128s)

Yeah, so as you can see at this point, my messages are the ones in green. I was kind of fed up, so that's why I say, "Well, is there anyone else I can talk to? Feel too busy." Because I was like, "Hey, there's got to be more than one elder. Like, you're off to Australia, right? Where's someone else? Like, this is my life I've put on hold here."

And I told him this on the phone. I was like, "Hey, you know, I'm not talking to anyone in my life at the minute. My life is on hold here and I kind of want to get in as [soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2158s) as possible so I can start making new relationships with people because I'm lonely. You know, this is really hard to not have contact with anyone and live in limbo and I'm constantly chasing you." So, and I say there, like, "Sorry to bother you, you know, I'm just keen." It was obvious that this is something I was passionate about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2181s)

And here's another one. It looks like they're referring you to another person here, Rod Buckley.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D2190s)

So yeah. Do you know who Rod Buckley is? Yeah, he's kind of like the PR guy, isn't he? And he's like the peeb lawyer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2200s)

Oh, so he's not even a priest?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2204s)

No, he's local in Torbay, like in the southwest of England, nowhere near where they'd have been from. Wow.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2216s)

He's essentially been a peeb spokesperson for probably pretty much since 2011, 2012\.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2226s)

Oh, it's before that because my parents were involved with him when they were going through their shit. So it'd been a long time. Wow.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2236s)

Any press inquiries or anything, you know, they all, or if a TV crew ever turns up anywhere, he'll get stuck in front of the camera, basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2246s)

And did they know at this point how far you had gone, that you were wearing dresses, that you had given up all of these connections to everybody? Did they know that you had gone this far?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2260s)

Yeah, so I said all of that in the meeting and this screenshot we're looking at was after the meeting, so they did know all of this stuff. I also kind of want to point out, you see in this screenshot at the very top it says, "I'll catch up with Dean, he's caring for his parents at the moment." So that's one excuse. And then a few messages down, he's like, "Oh no, he's had an operation." It's like, these are quite extreme excuses.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2289s)

It's October 22nd and then November 9th, right? Yeah.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2295s)

Yeah, it's delay tactics, isn't it? Well, I think I started talking to them in August and then it ended in November.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2309s)

The thing is, truthfully, we know here they just didn't have a clue what to say, did they? No, they had no idea how to handle this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2318s)

No, because it never happens. Yeah, it never happens. You were the perfect person to just be this person coming in who you wholeheartedly believed in what you're about to come into. I mean, the fact that you were wearing a headband, that you had switched to dresses, that you got rid of your TV, that you had told your parents and your family that, "Hey, I won't have any contact with you," like Emily, just shows the level of your commitment.

I am just absolutely shocked they didn't take the bullet on [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2356s) that they didn't take you. I'm so shocked. So shocked. I wanted to show the listeners and viewers how committed the guy that you were dating was. So walk us through this exchange here, Emily. Like, what prompted this conversation here?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2373s)

Yeah, so at this point, I had just said to him, "Look, I've tried to convince you to leave for me, and I'm going to give you the same opportunity of you can try and convince me to join for you because I think that's only fair." And these are the messages that he sent me to try and convince me to join. And there's a lot more to this conversation. We spent literally a whole [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2403s) talking about it and me going back and forth and asking questions. And then it was at the end of this conversation that I said, "Okay, I'll join for you. What do I have to do?" And he spoke me through what to do next.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2416s)

Wow. So for our listeners that aren't watching through video, I want to just read this out to you. So he responds, "I want to make a family with you, build a home of love and encouragement for our children. But I want to enjoy... I just asked before that too. Want to make your life happier than you ever thought it could be. I will be there for you through everything, consoling you and looking after you through the bad times, working through solutions to our problems together and making the happy and good times happier and better by giving you every [ounce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2446s) of love I've ever had in me."

"Loving you unconditionally every day from before I wake up to after I fall asleep for the rest of my life and having fun, making experiences with you, making you laugh, seeing your big old grin would be the highlight of my day every day no matter how many I live, doing everything together as one because you are my person as much as I might not have treated you like it. Please tell me what you're thinking."

So he [sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2476s) very committed, right? Like he was very committed into the situation and this wasn't just a fling, right? This wasn't, I think that's the biggest thing I want to get through to people is this wasn't just a one-off fling that was happening. It was a very committed, serious relationship. Did you guys speak of marriage? Did you guys have the marriage conversation?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2500s)

Yeah, so there was a point that we were looking at houses that we could buy together. So he had a deposit saved. So he was like, "You know what, like he did want me to be more of a traditional housewife." So he was like, "I will give you the money, you buy us a family home, you find whatever you want and we'll do it together." So yeah, there was a point where we were looking into that and he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2530s) very keen on getting married. But he wanted us to just have time in this marriage to ourselves and really get to know each other and have a lot of fun memories before we had children. But he was very keen on having quite a big family with me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2548s)

So that seems like it was very well thought out. That it wasn't just this, you know, jump into something, let's get married and have kids right away. It feels like this was very well thought out. You know, when you're putting that much thought and effort to knowing that you should take time first, right, to build this, it is a very well thought out plan. It just doesn't seem like it's something that just was sporadically happening. We have, when he, we have some messages from when he cut [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2578s) off with you.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2579s)

Whilst you get them up, can I quickly ask how long it was that you'd actually been in a relationship before you got messages like this from him? Was it pretty quick or so?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2599s)

We had met up once outside of work and that was kind of what changed us from a friendship into more of a relationship. But he didn't ask me out straight away because I said, "You know, I'm not sure on this. You know, you're in this religious group and I'm not sure if we can have a future together." So he didn't ask me out for quite a long time, but we were basically in a relationship. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2630s) then eventually that's when he said, "You know, for the right girl, I would leave." And I said, "Are you talking about me?" And he said, "Yeah." And that's what drove us to say, "Okay, let's be in a relationship." So there was a chunk of time where we technically weren't together but acting like we were.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D2649s)

Okay. Can I ask you, when he did ask you out, how he actually did that? Because, and the reason I'll give you a reason why I ask, is because dating as a whole in the brethren is a complete hash. Because you go through periods of no contact or you're not allowed to meet up unless supervised or [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2681s) I was never actually asked out, so to speak, in non-brethren terms in the brethren. So I'm really interested for you how that was different to perhaps your typical non-brethren asking out.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2698s)

So it was such a random moment that he asked me. We were just laying in bed together. I was literally just about to fall asleep because obviously, we stayed up all night together, so I was very tired a lot of the time. And he just blurted it out, "Will you be my girlfriend?" And I was kind of like, "Huh? Did I hear that right or am [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2728s) dreaming?" And he was like, "Oh, sorry, I probably should have planned something romantic, but I just, I feel like I love you. Will you go out with me?" And I was like, "Yeah, of course. I kind of thought we already were, but yeah."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2741s)

You're in my bed, darling. Wow. Yeah, no, that's interesting. So it's pretty normal. You know, you did quite well on that bit. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2753s)

So this was an exchange, an email exchange between the two of you. And is this after, this is after he cut it off with you, I'm assuming?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2766s)

Yeah, so it's after he cut it off, but just before he was shut up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2770s)

Okay. So I'm just going to read this for the listeners. "I have read, I think, every single word you said. It's correct. I know you haven't forgiven me and I don't expect you to, but I need you to know I am so, so sorry for what I've done and how I've affected your life. I truly am. And if I can, I will someday repay you. I love you so much. Still been so worried about you. I went to McDonald's on the off chance I'd see you. I'm sad that I didn't. I was searching for yellow cars."

"P.S. You won't be blocked on this email, but please don't talk to me. It's open for emergencies, physical, mental, [emotional,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2803s) financial, spiritual, but please only for use in emergencies. Although I understand if you don't think I'll be of any help or if you don't want to talk to me, but not for anything else. And although I'll always help in any way I can, it will be just as someone who loves you and cares about you, but not as a partner."

"I pray for you every night and morning and throughout the day and I think of you all the time. I've been sat refreshing my emails for quite some time, to be honest. Until we can speak again, I love you, Emily, and I miss you so, so much."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2833s)

Oh, that's so sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2835s)

It's just, I hope that people who are listening and watching this can understand the gravity of the situation. And I know I'm not the only sucker for love. I know I'm not the only one out there. Like, this is someone's heart that they were dealing with. This is someone's heart. We have a voice recording of a note after he broke up with you. Are you okay if we share that?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2875s)

Yeah, that's fine.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2878s)

I just want people to understand the level of pain that you went through after this all went down.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=2889s) **voice note**

“I knew it. As soon as I saw it, at like midday, I knew. And I messaged his actual phone number instead of WhatsApp and I just said, "Have you blocked me?" And he unblocked me on WhatsApp and he just said, "Hi, do you want the good days or the bad days?" And he just there. He just there. Oh my God. And I just said, "You're my friend aren’t you?" And he said, "Yeah and I can't risk it, I can't risk it." And I really, really tried to be nice and be good at and then it's all for me to see.. And now you have your whole family back and I have nothing. And he said, "I told you we were just friends." That's on you. But we weren’t  just friends. That's what I said. When I was your friend, you got shitty with me about it, about treating you as that, so I stopped. And it was like, "Yeah, but you led into it. It takes two to tango and you knew the risk. You knew that I wanted to get back and you knew that I wouldn't risk it again and I'd have to cut you off. Why did you string me along then? Why did [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3024s) talk about what our family would be? Why did you say all the things that you have when you didn't mean that? You just gotta say it. But it wasn't right. If I could choose who I'm in, I would have chosen a…You had to get right and you didn't think you weren't right. And then like, it didn't matter if I was a duff or what because that kind of thing doesn't matter.

I'll do a screen recording of the conversation so you can see it all. But I kept saying, "You hurt me so much. I'm in so much pain and you just seem so cold."

And he said he was in pain too and he just shut off. And they said to him, "Like, what, were you just not gonna tell me that?" And he was like, "I'm here now, aren't I?" And I was like, "I'm quite, you don't see that you can't just cut us off." And I'm like, "Well I'm talking to you, you do know I could have just left you alone." As if that's meant to make me feel better.

And then he goes on to start bitching about, "Oh, well, I'll probably never marry someone." Or, "You could have married me. I would have been there for you and I loved you. I would have done it all." He's going on about his shitty family, his shitty community, but they don't fucking love him to or why would they put him through all this shit.

I don't know what to do. But it's the thing I can't do. He said he won't block my number and if I ever truly need him, I could message him. But he said, "As soon as you talk to me to catch up, then I'll just block you without saying anything." And I kept saying to him, "I don't want to end on a bad note. And I'm not trying to be mean to you, but I'm just in so much pain. It's just so much. I don't mean too… It's not okay. I mean, there's nothing I can do, but I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say or what to be or what to feel. It's just real pain and it just happens. Because I try to, I try to, I try to…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3219s)

That's heart-wrenching. What's going through you right now having to listen to that back? I don't even know what to say. It's got to be so hard hearing. And I think this is the part that just really frustrates me, is that you did give everything, right? You gave everything for this situation and that choice was taken away from him and that choice was taken away from you due to priests that are not a part of a mainstream Christian church. They're a part of a cult.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3272s)

Yeah, so there was a lot of feelings of like rejection and like, "Why am I not good enough? Why can't I join? You know, why am I not good enough for him? Why won't he leave for me? Why don't they want me?" You know, listening to it back, I mean, that was like six, seven months ago now. And I can't believe that I was that upset. You almost forget. And hearing it back, I [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3302s) want to give myself a hug.

Yeah, it brought tears back to my eyes of like, "Wow, it really was that bad." And it's always like, I've shut myself off from it because it's like, I don't want to acknowledge how difficult it actually was. And actually, there is a little sense of anger, to be honest, because you know, this was after he was let back in after being shut up. And he went through the [whole,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3332s) "I can never speak to you again. I'm not going to want to risk it." And literally three days later, he messaged me saying, "Hey, how's it going?" And I thought, "How dare you?" Like, if you knew what I've gone through and you just casually spoken to me as if none of that happened. And yeah, I think...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3354s)

They're used to that level of trauma in there though, especially that particular family. I think it would just be like another day, another drama, another thing that makes you feel a bit shit. And the head fuckery is just next level. I mean, and it's not necessarily just him actually fucking with your head, it's the priests and the people that are above the priests trying to give the advice on how to deal with the situation.

And I think it's really important that we also bear in mind that the amount of pressure that that lad would have been put under would have been ridiculous. Like he would have been in so much emotional pain as well because of what he would have been told. You know, he'd have been told he's going to lose his [family,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3416s) he's going to lose his job, he's going to lose his money, he's going to lose his, you name it, he'd lose it. Like that was the threat that they put on him. And yet here was you on the opposite side ready to give all that up anyway to go and be with him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D3431s)

That's what I mean, right? That's the whole ludicrous part of all of this, is that it wasn't like the obstacle wasn't you, Emily, and the obstacle wasn't him, right? The obstacle was the set of beliefs, what they call morals. It was priests, it was, it's just, I again, I just get into no words because I get so frustrated and passionate inside about what they present to the public versus what is actually happening inside there.

He did send [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3471s) a message, a letter, it was a handwritten letter when he did end things with you. When did you get this letter?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3478s)

So this was a few days after he broke up with me. So he texted me saying things are over, I can't give up my community. And that day or that evening, he wrote the letter because he had my spare key, so he had to send it back to me. But he did confess to me that they told him what to write. So it wasn't actually his words, he just copied it down and yeah, he sent my [key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3508s) back.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3508s)

Okay, so this is the letter that he wrote you and he told you that the priests helped him write it?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3514s)

Yeah, that's right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3516s)

Yeah. So I did block out his name for a certain reason at the end. It says, it's dated July 14th of 2022\. "Dear Emily, I've come to it that my place in the community and my link with the Lord Jesus are too strong for me to turn my back on it and continue my relationship with you. I wish you all the best and happiness in your future." Such a typical peeb letter, right?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D3542s)

Yes, it is. Like such a typical carbon copy of what they would say.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3548s)

Devoid of any feeling.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3549s)

Totally cold. It's just the opposite of what you would normally find inside a mainstream Christian church, right? How did it, like, what went through your head when you received this?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3566s)

So when he actually broke up with me via text, he blocked me for about an hour and then he unblocked me and he was like, "I will talk to you, I just need to keep you blocked." So he did at that point, me being the dramatic girl I am, I had already jumped in my car and he lives 45 minutes away. So I was driving to his house like, "I'm not going to go without a fight, sweetheart."

At that point, I convinced him to come out and we [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3596s) speak face to face in my car about it and he said, "Okay, tomorrow I'm gonna tell them I'm definitely leaving." That did not happen. But he told me, "I've sent you a letter, by the way." So I knew it was coming. But when I actually received it, it was different. Like there was something about me getting that key back that felt very final of like, "Oh, this is actually over now. Like he's not coming back." And it was [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3626s) upsetting.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3627s)

This is the thing that they don't realize. They're playing with people's mental health, actually. And it, this could, for the wrong person, this could, you know, lead to, dare I say it, suicide if they're that invested in a relationship. And you've listed the things that you'd have done for this lad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3656s)

It's love. That's what I mean. It's like the thing that everybody on this planet searches for. We all search for love in some way, shape, form, or matter. We all search to be loved and we search to learn how to love ourselves. That is just the human thing. They interfered with a choice that is, like I say, I'm going to reiterate it, it's one of the most pivotal choices that anybody makes in their life, right?

It's just, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3686s) what I think the whole Charity Commission needs to get a hold of, is to understand that here's a prime example of somebody that was willing to give up absolutely everything that she knew, full-fledged, wanted to learn their ways like, "Introduce me, I want to learn, I want to know about all of this." And they didn't allow it.

And this is, it doesn't matter if there's people out there that don't think that you should have joined. That isn't the point that we're trying to make here. The point is, is that this mainstream Christian church said, "No, you cannot join. You can't come to our meetings." They denied you that opportunity. They should not have a charity status. They should not have a charity status.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3728s)

Did you feel that he was being forced to break up with you?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3733s)

Yeah, definitely. There is, I think there is one of the screenshots that I sent you where he says about the power struggle in these meetings because he did say, "Like, I really wish I advocated for you more." But he was like, "You don't understand what it's like in those meetings. Like, I just have to sit and listen to what I'm being told. I can't say anything back."

And just going back to like mental health, at this time when he broke up with me, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3764s) didn't eat anything for two whole weeks. And it took me two months to actually be able to eat like one or two actual meals a day. I wasn't sleeping, I didn't leave the house, and I cried every single day. Just like that voice note, I had a bottle of Rescue Remedy, it's a thing that calms you down. I was literally, I took that every hour because I couldn't cope. I was a nervous wreck.

And [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3794s) one point, my hair started falling out. I lost probably like half a head of hair, to be honest. Like, I was so stressed. So yeah, it really did affect me in a way that nothing has ever affected me before. And I just was so at a loss. I didn't know what to do because, you know, I've never been in a situation before like this and no one understood it in my life. They were like, "It's just a boy, get over it." But I just couldn't.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3824s)

You'll never be in a situation like this again. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3830s)

What were you going to say, Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3834s)

No, I was just touching on your point about the Charity Commission thing. There's obviously the side from Emily's point of view and obviously, you know, I can remember I was getting daily, multiple messages a day of that kind of message of how she was feeling. But I was just thinking that when you read out that email from the lad, you can tell in the way he's writing that email, it's a complete, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3864s) I remember saying this to you at the time, Em, that it's a complete battle between his head and his heart.

Yeah, because you can tell in those, what the words he's using, he obviously desperately wanted to be with you, but he knew the years of brainwashing had done to him, had, you know, it was creating this problem for him in his head where [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3894s) just couldn't, he thought he couldn't get past it. And you know, I only related it to my experience because I was in a similar situation, granted it was the other way around, but I was in a similar situation when I left. And it is just a complete and utter, it messes with your head so much. But like, you know, come back to your point about the Charity Commission, why should he be making the choice between church and love?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3920s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3921s)

Why should that be the choice that he has to make? You know, you think of, like coming back to your point about mainstream church, if you were to go to any church, you know, any other mainstream church and you were in a church and you brought along somebody or your new partner, they'd go, "Hey, great, you know, it's another opportunity for us to reach out to someone else." Yeah, yeah. Tell me that that kind of attitude of, "[Yes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3953s) great, it's another one to add to our numbers," not that the church is all about numbers, but that kind of, you know, as opposed to the whole, "No, you're not good enough for us, we're too high and mighty, you know, we can't, you know, we're not going to mix with you."

And I remember, I remember talking to you, Em, about after that meeting you had with the elders and some of the things you told me that they said at the time, I just, one, it brought so many memories back, but two, they were just so [condescending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3983s) and just, yeah, there's just absolutely no element of true Christianity in that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=3999s)

Not at all. Do you remember some of the specific things that they said in that meeting?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4006s)

Yes, I have some notes next to me of what they said word for word. So I wrote it down after the meeting so I wouldn't forget. So you actually said it earlier pretty much word for word, the sovereignty of God to where you're born and like the holy fellowship. They actually asked me at one point, they said, "What makes you good enough to join us?" And I was like, "I don't know what to say for that."

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4036s) you know, they were lucky because they had the “wonderful knowledge of the truth of man and the love of the scriptures.” And they gave me a step-by-step guide of how I could have a wonderful transaction with Christ. And that I had to confess all my sins and, you know, be cleansed of the dirtiness. But yeah, they, oh, it's so messed up, man. Yeah.

They ultimately ended with, "You know what, it's not up to us, it's up to the Lord. So we'll pray and, you know, once we get an answer, we'll get back to you. But in the meantime, you need to have, my soul needs to be at peace and I need to have this transaction, I need to have a sign." And, you know, ultimately they're not qualified to make such a decision, but they'll pray for me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4108s)

And [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4109s) they pray with you?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4110s)

No, no, they didn't, actually. I did say to them at the very end, I was like, "Can I have some mentorship? Because I know that, you know, women kind of have a lot of guidelines and I was like, I don't know what to do, so it'd be great." And you know, with reading the Bible, they said I had to read like Paul's teachings and I was like, "You know, great, can you explain them to me?" And they just said, "Oh yeah, we'll be in touch with all that." And then they just probably because they didn't know them.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4138s)

Yeah, probably. Yeah, that guy, Gilli.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4147s)

I was just gonna say, what a question. "What makes you think you're good enough to join?" Really?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4155s)

And they don't really deny over and over that they're a cult. That is like, that's just, that is not a mainstream Christian church. Like after I left, I just walked into a Catholic church, I was received with open arms. It just wasn't for me. And then went to, I tried, I think it was a Baptist church, I've tried a United church, everybody received me with open arms, right? Like it just, it's so crazy that they can hold a charity status the way they do, [yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4186s) have closed doors and deny someone as beautiful as you are, Emily, inside and out, and deny your access to the teachings.

Yet when you sit here and look at their frequently asked questions on their website, here's what comes up: "How can I become a member? Our evangelical work is intended to lead people to Christ for the salvation of their souls for now and eternity. Any that are prepared to be committed to our beliefs and way of life may choose to join our church."

Which we are having a whole account here on this podcast where someone's been trying to do this and they're not allowing it because they [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4230s) that they are the special ones and only they that are born into it should be allowed to do this or be a part of this. And this is where the Charity Commission needs to hold them accountable because they're not holding up their end to their agreement.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4245s)

Yeah, so they kept really reiterating that they are a special vessel and this is not joining a club. You don't sign up for a membership and walk in. No, no, you have to be a certain type of person. They kept saying, "You know, we've only known one or two people in our lifetime that's done it. You know, it's so difficult, you're going to have to give up everything." And it was always that, it's trying to scare me. And I was like, "Yeah, well, I'm already doing that."

And then that's when they were kind of looking at each other thinking, or probably [thinking,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4275s) "Oh no, what do we say now? You know, we're not, we're not dissuading her easily." And then that's when they kind of, honestly, they would say something, I would reply, and they'd sit in silence for like 30 seconds and it was so awkward. And I was like, "What do I do?" But they obviously were thinking of something to say. They were like, "Oh shit, she's persistent." But eventually, they just kind of fobbed me off with the, "Yeah, we'll pray for you and hopefully something will happen."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4304s)

Those awkward moments in priestly visits, do you guys remember those? Oh, yeah. Sometimes I can give me the knife, I can cut the air, right? That's your typical. So who were the priests that you sat down with?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4322s)

So it was Dean Bowie and Johnny Beattie.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4328s)

Boom shakalaka. That makes sense.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4337s)

One of those was your ex-employer, right?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4339s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4341s)

But that's so messed up how they're mixing the two as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4347s)

Exactly, right. And that's when we get into the situations that we get into every day, right? That's why we have the situations that we have, is because so many crossovers. People talk about the bullying at OSG, right, at their schools, is because these kids, they never get a break from them, right? It's just there's never a break.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4372s)

I was just going to ask you if anyone made you aware, other than obviously like the ex-preacher Facebook groups, about any of the other stuff that goes on in there, such as the different kinds of abuse. And did he ever explain any traumas to you in terms of what had gone on in the church locality or family or friends or anything like that? Was [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4402s) of that ever mentioned to you? Like if he wanted you to fully know what you were getting into, was the extremely dark side of the brethren explained to you?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4424s)

He told me about his experiences and what his family have been through and put him through as well. So yeah, I do know about the dark side of it. But you know, when we were talking about me joining, I think we both kind of just politely ignored that because neither of us wanted to acknowledge that side of it. Because you know, we were so desperate, it was like, "I can put [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4454s) with all this stuff if it meant I was with you."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4458s)

Yeah, and that's what they're all doing. Yeah, they're all just, they're all just politely brushing over it as if it's not there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4465s)

So has his family been through quite a bit? Like, his family had been through quite a bit of trauma?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4470s)

Yeah. So I know that he's from a lower family, so they were just kind of bullied a lot. I know that his dad is an alcoholic and used to hit his wife and his children. I know that there was like sexual abuse that went on as well, and I think his parents split up for a while. So he was severely [bullied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4500s) at school because that's not normal for parents to split up in the brethren.

I know that he had a lot of problems with his sister as well. And his sister, when she moved out and got married, she turned him away and was like, "You're not welcome in my house." And there was quite a lot of brethren houses he couldn't go to because he wasn't welcome because of his family status. And his mum did kick him out for two years as well, so he had to stay at other brethren's houses, just because he used to get into fights with his dad all the time.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D4534s)

You know, it blows my mind that he didn't leave. It literally blows my mind because I am aware of his background and for various reasons, like he's got a girl like you willing to do anything for him. And this just shows how deep the indoctrination is. This shows how brainwashed those poor people are.

Like, how blind are these people? And you know, when this podcast is launched, I can see that it could come back on him, but I just pray that he's brave enough to get the hell out of there because it's never going to get any easier for him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4591s)

Do you have hopes? Like, do you still hold out hopes or are you over this?

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4600s)

Well, he is a year younger than me, so there's a part of me that thinks, you know, if he just grows up and matures a little bit, you know, when he maybe gets to 25 and his brain starts working properly, maybe, "I've made the wrong choice here." I think I will always have hope that he will, not to come out and be with me, but just so he deserves [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4630s) much better. Like, he deserves a full life out here and just happiness and, you know, love, whether it's me or somebody else, and just not to go through this abuse all the time, every day.

I think, you know, I don't think I can be in contact with him. I don't think it's healthy for me to be. But I think if he, I'd say to him, you know, "[Leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4660s) and then come and find me and I will help you and we'll see where this kind of goes." But yeah, I think, I mean, there's always going to be that what if, because we never finished our story. So I think I will always have hope and I think I'll always love him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4676s)

Yeah. Oh, bless you, Em, you're such a sweetheart. I want to share one of the text messages where he talks about the pressures of the meeting. This is a message that he was talking to you about the meetings and stuff. Walk us through what this conversation was about.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4696s)

So I basically said, like, I wish he would have advocated for me in his first meeting when he said, "Hey, I want to leave," and they were like, "Absolutely not." I wish he would have really fought for me and said, "Well, you know, can she come in then? Like, is there options here? I love this girl." So I was just trying to get across, like, "I really wish you would have tried because, you know, I've gone to all this effort [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4726s) like, you know, going to this meeting and chasing the elders and all of that."

And I feel like you've just kind of sat there and not really done much on your end. But you know, they probably would have worked with you and they would have, well, at least I thought they might have received me better at this meeting if he had said, "You know, I am pretty adamant. I want to be with this girl and she is willing. Can you help us?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4750s)

Yeah, I agree. So I'm just going to read this out for the listeners. So this is him speaking. "The power balance in those meetings is whack. Don't be too harsh on me. And if I say the wrong thing, they might just say, 'Nah, we're not meeting you next week. You can't join the Zoom meetings anymore and you need to find a new place to live.'" And I mean, that is true. That is literally, it's just, they can cut you off just like that.

So he says, "I definitely agree with you, I do, but just wanted you to understand how little [bargaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4781s) power I had, if that makes sense." And you responded, "Yeah, I understand." And he says, "But yes, I wish I'd been more definite about you." And you said, "I wish you would have tried." And he said, "You are right." And you said, "At least in desperation, yeah."

And I mean, it is a sad situation because he wouldn't have had a lot of, when you're under that kind of indoctrination, right, you don't believe that you have a choice. You don't believe that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4811s) have the power of yourself to say, "No, this is what I want," because they can strip your whole life away from you. And that again is what makes this a cult and not a mainstream Christian church. Is that when someone holds that kind of power over their members, they are no longer a mainstream Christian church. They're just not. And again, I'll say it, they do not deserve a charity status. They just don't.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4837s)

I remember him saying with the first meeting he had when he told them about me, he didn't really even get the opportunity to say that, "Actually, I want to leave for her," or anything like that. He just said, "I have a girlfriend, but she's a worldly." And then that's when they were like, "Okay, we're helping you cut this off. You know, you need to write this letter and you need to block her," and all of this. It wasn't even a conversation of, "Okay, you know, what can we do? How can we help you?" It [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4868s) just like, "Nope, that's not allowed. She needs to go."

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4873s)

That's also the, you know, the lack of, the complete lack of feeling they have for anyone that's not part of them. And it goes back to that what you were saying earlier about, you know, he blocked you, cut you off, you know, through your heartache, and then three days later he's back on the scene going, "Yeah, hey." And it's just that thing which is a common theme amongst the peeps of, "Well, you're not one of us, so you don't have valid feelings." You know, it's that disdain for anyone who's not part of them. It's just so rife that they just happily drop someone and then think they can pick them back up whenever suits them.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4922s)

Yeah. And that's what annoys me about with some of the RRT stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4927s)

That's where I want to go next.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4929s)

Yeah, like seeing them having a meeting with the Prime Minister at Grenfell where they'd probably, like the people that lived in Grenfell, bless them, were probably of a lower class or a different ethnicity to a lot of people. And you know, stuff like racism, stuff like taking the piss out of homeless people is across the board [rife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4960s) in there. Like, because I was brought up in there, some of the words that I came out with, I've had to be corrected since I've come out. "You don't say that." Because and yet they're being like all charitable, "Oh, here's some water, here's a this, here's a that," when inside they take the absolute piss out of these people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=4983s)

It's the charity, the RRT charity is for everybody listening and watching, it is just a mask. It is a mask for them to keep their charity status. We have an RRT podcast coming up soon and we're going to unpack all of the RRT bullshit. And hopefully, it will shed some light for those that are [thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5013s) of supporting them to not support them, right? I don't care if it's a charity. When you support RRT, you are supporting what they believe. It just comes down to that.

I think there needs to be cleaner lines drawn now. I think that we need to quit pussyfooting around some of the things that we've been treading water around. There needs to be cleaner, sharper lines drawn in the sand where you just don't support them. You don't support them on any level.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5049s)

Yeah. Even the companies that are offering rebates to them, like if you actually knew what you're supporting. It's not just like a "fund the kids to go to school" thing like they put out, like "Fuels the School" and all this. You're supporting people that will sweep pedophilia under the carpet. They ignore the wives who are in domestic abuse situations. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5080s) know, I could carry on. Bullying in schools, they just ignore it, pretty much.

Yes, they've got all the right documentation for, who is it, Ofsted? They've got all the right documentation for that, but you think you're not implementing, and I can talk from experience on this, in a recent experience in the Coventry locality of which I left, none of those pieces of paper mean anything. [They've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5112s) got the boxes ticked like they always do, but it means nothing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5118s)

And I mean, yeah, go ahead, Gilli.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5122s)

No, I was just going to comment on that, which is exactly what they've done here with Emily. They've ticked the boxes. They've had a meeting, they've spoken to her, they've given her the PR person's contact details, for what? Yeah. They've done their dutiful part with absolutely not a shred of genuine interest.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5146s)

Yeah, and also on their meeting room signs, they got changed over the Charity Commission stuff. I'll have to take a picture of them, go past. They all got renewed. Yeah, they all got changed to it being a mainstream Christian church and it's got a number.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsPARTq2Qops%26t%3D5168s)

Yeah. So why Rod Buckley? Do you know what I mean? Like why all of a sudden the other end of the country when you've got these people's names that you can contact on the meeting room?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5184s)

Yeah, because it always used to be the local trustees. That's it. Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5192s)

Yeah, but that's the thing, isn't it? It's like you say, a box-ticking exercise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5196s)

And it's all just a facade. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, Emily, your story is a perfect example. It is a perfect example of no matter what you're willing to give up, you cannot get in there, right? Everything else is just a mask and a face that they have to present in order to keep their charity status. The charity status needs to go. That's all I have to say.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5216s)

Yeah, so I looked up on Google whilst we were talking what the definition of "mainstream" is. And the meaning is "normal, conventional, or ordinary." Like from your experience, Emily, I think we can see that this is no normal, conventional, or ordinary mainstream Christian church.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5242s)

No, not at all. And just quickly actually going back to the charity, sorry, I just remembered my guy actually did do some work for them. It was like the hottest day of the year and he had to go to London and hand out water bottles. But I remember it was our boss that told him he had to do it. And it wasn't a case of, "You know, we want to help people," or, "You know, people are suffering, you know, it's going to be really hot." It was, "[We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5273s) have to do this. We have to send someone. You're the one that doesn't have enough work. Can you go and do it?" You know, there was no compassion for the actual work that was being done. It was just, "We need to tick this box, you're going," and that was it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5285s)

Yeah, I've heard that quite a bit inside there. And usually those with the lower status, right, the people that have, you know, they're the ones that usually have to end up doing the volunteering at Campus of Compassion or are the ones that get sent out to the RRT locations.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5301s)

Yeah, I've got countless emails of, "We need X many volunteers, we need this many. Look, it's tomorrow now, we need this many still." And like, it reduced by like one number. Like, no one could actually, no one was being charitable. It was like, "We need this many. If you're free, please just do it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5324s)

And you know, they really miss the whole point of charity, right? Like charity, we don't sit here and talk about all the families that we're helping out. We don't talk about, like, you're not sitting there broadcasting about all the charity that you do or the money that you handed to some homeless person or the water. Like, you don't, charity is not about flaunting it.

And you know, I'm really excited to do this RRT podcast. I'm really excited to be able to dive into some of the numbers and [dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5354s) into the absolute hypocrisy of what they call their charity. And hopefully, it comes crashing down. Yeah.

Emily, we are very, very appreciative of you coming on and being so authentic, vulnerable, and bearing your heart and sorrow to us. Our heart goes out to you. I know you're in a much better place now, but I'm sure this is hard to revisit. And I really hope that out of you coming forward, some changes might be made, whether that happens now or later on. I know your story will be very impactful. [It'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5398s) be impactful inside the Charity Commissions and I know it will be impactful for those that are watching it. So we are very grateful that you came on and shared your broken heart with us because it was well warranted. I hope we can mend it a little bit for you, babe.

### [**Emily Victoria**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5418s)

Yeah. I think I'm okay, actually. Like, I mean, we're now coming up to almost a year since this happened, so it's been a long time and a lot of healing. I did do another podcast the other day and from that, another guy has reached out to me to say, "My story is exactly the same as yours. I'm with you." And you know, that's beautiful, worth it because it's like he felt like, "Oh, there's someone else like me." And I felt the same. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5450s) you know, the fact we've connected is great. So even if I just helped that one person, it's worth it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPARTq2Qops&t=5454s)

Exactly. Yeah, and that's what this is for, right? If every podcast helps one person, right, you know, the domino starts going. Yeah. Oh, much love to you. Thank you so much. Thanks, everyone, for listening. And until next time, much love to you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
