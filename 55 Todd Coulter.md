## Summary

In 1978, after the Jonestown massacre in which 900 people died, police searching the cult’s compound found tens of thousands of doses of  mood altering drugs, both legal and illegal, that were used to control members who were considered to be insubordinate.
We have long been aware  of the extensive abuse of prescription drugs by the brethren’s “in-house” doctors to dope and medicate troublesome cult members – including the illegal and brutal attempt by Australian PBCC doctor, Mark Craddock at “conversion therapy” in which he tried to chemically change a gay member in to a straight one, using the chemical castration drug, Cyprostat.
Could the brethren sink any lower?
Yes, they can and did. Get-a-Life hears the story of Todd Coulter, who was “prescribed” Cyprostat for years, at his own expense, by Detroit brethren doctor Phil Truan. The doctor admitted that the drug was illegal in the USA, and arranged to have it shipped direct to Todd from the UK. After years of obediently taking the drug, Todd developed painful lumps in his breasts, requiring expensive surgery.
What was the justidication for this drastic and illegal medical intervention? Listen to this shocking episode to find that out – and much, much more.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### **Lane Admiraal**

Hola amigos, welcome back to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We're here with the original OG crew and a special friend of mine, Todd Coulter. Um, me and Todd have become really close over the last little while. We weren't, we didn't really know each other in the church but we've been talking a lot and Todd has some crazy stuff to share. His life has been wild but he's such an amazing person, so I'm really happy to introduce him and he also has some some news [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=87s) the PBCC that he's going to share with us. Go ahead, Todd.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=91s)

Well, obviously I'm Todd Coulter. I'm from the East Coast of uh, United States. Um, I came from a big family of 10 people, uh, 10 kids and obviously the parents, so it was 12\. Um, so before I go on to my story, um, I would like to share some news that I got on Sunday from a good friend of mine, Jonathan Thomas from Australia.

He reached out to me and asked if he could chat with me and it sounded quite urgent.

So his daughter left in 2019\. She wanted to pursue college and a university of some sort and so she just up and left. Didn't let her parents know, left a note and off she went.

The Sunday after that, they were all in the Sunday meeting and whoever was taking the reading at that point brought it up that they caused their child to leave of some sort, you know, whatever the wording was, I don't know, but they all looked at each other, Jonathan, his ex-wife now, Carrie and their son, which has special needs, all closed their Bibles in the middle of the meeting and got up and walked out.

And that was it.

So they obviously have been, you know, gone through a lot. Since leaving, he has always been gay. He, he um, knew it in there but he knew they were looked down on, so he was forced to be married to a female, which they did have two children. Um, but when his daughter left, he, she for some reason has put a restraining order against [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=210s) um, for never, for him never to have contact with her ever again. Um, so she's, you know, pursuing college and everything. And after leaving, I've actually had a couple Zoom calls with both of them before they got divorced and everything. Um, and then he came out and told them that, told me that they were getting divorced and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=240s) he came out as being gay and, you know, they were going to separate.

Um, he still had legal right to his son because he was very close to him, so they saw him. Um, and he has now pursued his dream job of being a flight, a flight attendant at Qantas, which he is doing very well at.

So, they separated.

Unfortunately, the brethren stepped in and had paid for all her court costs for the divorce, which was a red flag for me right in the beginning.

So, he called me on Sunday and told me that his ex-wife and his son went back to the brethren.

His son texted him and said, "Father, I will not have anything more to do with you. I am back with the brethren." And he was badly treated in there because of his condition and stuff like that. So he obviously is going through an extremely tough time right now. And one thing his ex-wife told him is he would never go back even though they're paying for the court costs. Um, so pretty much he will never have contact with his son again. Um, and his daughter, there's always hope. There's always hope. There is always hope. Um, but that that has hit me pretty hard over the last, yeah.

A few, you know, a few days.

He also told me that there was somebody over there that was also gay that left about 20 years ago. And he is going back to the brethren.

BDH just gave him a pile, an envelope with $10,000 in cash and paid for some five-star hotel helping him get back in.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=365s)

Um, bribery upon bribery. Yeah, it is. And and the thing is, it's sad becausea lot of these people have been taught to just love money, you know, and so they judge success by money. So as soon as they get into a tight spot, it's like they feel like shame for having no money and then they go, oh, well the brethren's got money, right? And the brethren just knows that they can just offer the money, put them up in a hotel like that. It's so sad.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=396s)

Well, that's what I told Jonathan on Monday night. I said, unfortunately, she knows she's going to be taken care of in there. She's not going to have to worry about a job ever again. She will probably have a place to live. Unfortunately, her son is always going to be treated badly regardless.

And even worse now that he was gone for, you know, two or three years. Um, so he's obviously devastated. He's, you know, obviously pretty low. Um,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=425s)

So you know, sometimes Todd, sometimes, I mean, I thought about going back once, right? Now I wasn't planning on staying back. I just wanted to get my green card to the States. But I think once it's opened, once the door is opened a little bit, right, you might go back. But permanently stay back, you're the chances that you'll permanently stay back are less. Not saying they're, you know, they're gonna leave again, but the chances are lower [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=456s) they'll stay back in because it's hard to rewire the brain back to that way of thinking, right? Back to this judgmental hatred of other humans and thinking they're, they're better than them and and thinking that only matters is money and and all that way of thinking, it's hard to go back into that. So I hope, I hope that they learn when they're back there. I hope they actually listen to what the brethren say in the meetings, read the bible, read what it [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=486s) says. It's terrifying. You don't want to be in there. There's no fun and joy, right? It's, so they might go back for temporary, but I really hope that they, that they learn from their time back in there.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=498s)

Well it's, you know, from all I've learned since I've left, um, which actually marks six years on Friday. Oh, wow. Congratulations. Thank you. Um, it is becoming more and more how BDH wants to twist the scriptures to suit his financial needs and his, his wealth and how he can control 50,000 people.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=525s)

Yeah, and this game, this, this game is so old. It's being played a million times by a million other cult leaders throughout history. Just read it. And he's just like all the other ones, uses the, the words and he can twist them and make anything out of it. And it's so easy to do. It's so

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=547s)

easy to do, right?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=548s)

Well and yet,

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=549s)

Go on. No, I was gonna say I met my uncle, which is 76 on, on Sunday for breakfast and I told him, he's very, you know, he likes going to church and I, if that helps him, that's fine. But I told him, you got to remember one thing. We, me and you could read the exact same verse of scripture and I will interpret it completely different than you. And I said, that is what's happened in there. You've got to remember that scripture was produced by [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=580s) man. And and re, the bible was rewritten by a man and it was his own, it was his own thinking. It wasn't word for word on how you cut, whatever bible he read it from.

Um, so you know, he obviously thanked me for that, but it's still, you know, he's been out for 40 some years or 50 years. So, um, but yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=610s)

So where, when, when did you leave? Let's start off with your story and just maybe let the viewers know, um, where you're from.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=618s)

So I am from Westfield. That was the locality I was from. Okay. Um, so I was from a family of 10 children. I was the third in line. Um, and um, I just, you know, from a young age, I have to say it wasn't that way growing up. It was, you know, pretty standard practice. But obviously as the years went on and more technology came [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=652s), you could see the scriptures being twisted and more was about BDH and John Hales and just everything started twisting more about BDH, his sons. It wasn't about the scripture, it was more about them. 

Um, I was in his presence three times and never felt anything. It was the biggest joke I've ever had. Um, you know, one time I, I was completely drunk. I don't remember [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=683s) thing because that's what they did. You know, the minute you walked through the door, you were handed a hard drink. It was just what it was. I mean, it was, you know, um, unfortunately, I think they used alcohol to inebriate people. So they didn't really, you know, they sort of just went with the flow, um, of what was going on.

But, you know, unfortunately schooling, as I grew up, schooling was just starting, you know, so we were in local rooms, we were, you know, in people's basements, we were, you know, there was no true teacher, there was no principal. So kids really just, really did what they wanted. Um, and unfortunately it never gave me a fair chance. Um, I never got the proper teaching I needed. Um, you know, like teaching like,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=730s)

…like education, like high school education you mean?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=732s)

You know, proper reading, proper, you know, writing. Um, I have trouble writing. I mean, I'm, I'm pretty good at it, but I had trouble writing, but if I knew what I know now, if I was in a proper school, I wouldn't have those problems. Yeah. Um, so it was, it was that way all, all along. And then, you know, they took me out of brethren, brethren school for a little bit, put me into public school in middle school and it just neverit never really, you know, got myself into trouble, you know, looking up stuff on, you know, the computers because all of a sudden I realized you could go into the library and pretty much look up whatever you wanted. 

Um, and we weren't taught what was right and wrong. So, you know, you didn't know anything about computers. So I just thought, great, let's just go start looking stuff up, you know. So I was caught with looking up, you know, pictures of naked women and, you know, all [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=793s) a sudden I was kicked out of school and they're like, oh, this guy's got a problem. And, you know, when you look back on it, you didn't have the proper health care, health education and what was right and wrong, you know, you only knew what was wrong, you didn't know what was right. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=810s)

What what young boy doesn't want to look up some titties and naked women, right? 

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=814s)

Like no, I and that's the thing, but it's like they didn't, they didn't guide you and like, you don't do that in public school. No, exactly. You know, you don't, they don't, they don't guide you like, hey, you shouldn't be doing that, you know, you're wrong women, you know, yeah. Um, but then from a, it just started, it really started in uh, you know, middle school. It just, you know, I, I actually enjoy talking, you know, I have better conversations sometimes with women than [men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=845s), unfortunately. Not that I do, don't say,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=848s)

Yeah, that's fine. That's totally fine.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=850s)

But I mean, I have great, I have great guy friends too, but I just sometimes feel more comfortable chatting with a female. Um, so even that was looked down on in, uh, in the church. Like I would be chatting with a married woman at church or even a single woman and I got chastised for it. You know, why are you talking to that lady by yourself? It's like, I can't have a conversation. Excuse my French. Oh, no, that French is allowed on here. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=881s), I can't have that chat with that lady. It's like, you know, it's not like we're going off in a car together or, you know, but they always assume way more than what was actually happening.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=892s)

Do you think Todd that's because they oversexualize everything?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=895s)

Yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

So it just really started as a young age. And then it just, you know, just kept. And then, you know, I got to the age where you could masturbate. And, you know, obviously, that was looked down on quite a bit, and very much so.

And then even looking at women walking along the road, you know, my father would chat, you know, just beat it into me, why are you looking at her, why are you doing this, why are you doing that. Um, you know, anytime I did masturbate, it was, you know, you had to bring it to the priests. Um, so it just really just kept, it was just non-stop, non-stop. And then obviously as I got older, you know, I wasn't allowed a Blackberry. I was only allowed a flip [phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=948s) because you could look up stuff on BlackBerrys that you couldn't look up on flip phones.

I couldn't have a BlackBerry. So it just, it just was nonstop. I was, I actually got fired from one of my last jobs, second to last job in there because, I'm going to use his name in here because he's a prick, pretty much. Jay Mornan made up a story about a woman that was working in the office to Garth Walker, who I worked for, that this [lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=985s) was scared around me and she does not want me around her anymore. I happened to hear this and I actually faced the woman with it. And she said, I never made up any of those stories. I don't know where this came from. So I challenged both of them.

And on the day I was fired, I actually, Garth Walker was standing in front of me and Jay Mornan was standing behind him. And it made me realize actually how much of a scaredy cat he was. And I told him right to his face. I'm like, you have to, you have to hide behind Garth, because I'm going to beat you.

That's how mad I was at him. And I said, you made up this story to get me fired because you knew how good I was for you.

And, you know, that was the end of it. I packed up my stuff and walked out. Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1046s)

How old were you at this point?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1050s)

Uh, that was about 2015, so I was, you know, early 30s. Um, and I just, that was it. There was no, you know, nothing else. I knew was a whole crock of, I told my father it was. So it just, it kept going. Every job I had, it was just the same thing day in, day out. It's never...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1074s)

Bullying time.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1075s)

It's straight up...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1076s)

Bullying you receive.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1077s)

They never would let me have a sales job. They always said I was, that, that's not meant for you. Um, they, when I, my last job, I worked for Bruce Trucker Miller and I was put in the warehouse making $17 an hour and working 70 hours a week. And that was on salary, that wasn't hourly.

And, and it just, it just was work wise. It just, you know, my brother that was younger than me is still in there. He was like second in command and he was making a shit ton of money. And I'm like, what the hell was, you know, it just shows you, you kiss people's backsides and you, you bow down.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1125s)

For the listeners, right, like when you're inside this cult, you don't have a choice to get a job on the outside, right? You can't just be like, I'm done with this work, I'm gonna go find work somewhere else. No, you are limited to Plymouth Brethren

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1141s)

businesses. You have to work for one. This is a good point that you just said, Lane. When I was fired from Garth Walker's place, we're set up to find me a job. So I literally sat at home and I was told not to do unemployment because it would be a detriment to the company. So I literally did not do unemployment. I sat at home unpaid for literally three months till these two clowns found me a [job.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1171s)

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1172s)

So they bullied you into not taking unemployment. Yes. That can't be legal.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1177s)

I know. Oh my goodness. And that actually was not only one time, there was actually a, when I used to work at Allmark Door Company, which is Gilbert Markham's company, I think they've sold it now, that happened to me too. I, I, Andrew Markham called me into his office and just said, you're done. I've heard bad reports about you, you're done. And I'm like, what reports have you heard? And he's like, I can't tell you. I've, and my brother, which is older than me was one of my bosses [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1207s) I went to a couple other ones that were above me and I said, have I done anything wrong? I just was told I'm not working here anymore. And they all looked at me like, what the hell are you talking about? I'm like, yeah, I was just told by Andrew Markham, we had some really bad complaints about you and we're letting you go.

That was it, done.

And I was told then also not to, not to file unemployment because it's going to be bad against, against Allmark Door Company.

Firing you, they tell you not to get unemployment as well. The audacity of these people. Yeah. So you know, and then through that time, you know, um, so that was one side of it. Then I had, you know, my personal side, you know, I had the sexual drive, I had, you know, the just like any man and woman have desire to look at women, for what women to look at, good fit men. I just tried to find any way I could to enjoy life and that was just thrown at me like a ton of bricks. Um, I remember probably about 2017, uh, 2014 right [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1285s) Roy Symington married Rhoda Markham. Um, I remember a priestly with him. I think it was because I was caught with a, a phone at one point. I was caught many times with illicit phones.

Um, and he, I think it was about the phone, but it might have been about me masturbating or something like this. But he, I remember sitting in his living room, it was my father, of course, numbers was everything for them in priestlies. The more men they had, the better they were. So it was Roy Symington, Dave Patterson and my father and me. And this one sticks in my mind [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1332s) most because Roy stood up out of his couch and the look on his face scared the shit out of me. It was like he had flames coming out of his eyes. It was like his face was beet red, his eyes were beet red. He looked like the devil coming at you. And I still remember getting in the car and I'm like, I, I still was puzzled, like I still was puzzled what was going on. And my father's like, did you see how upset [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1363s) is by, by you doing bad things?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1367s)

What were these bad things that he was so mad about?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1371s)

I probably masturbation or, you know, I masturbated and was caught with a phone. It was probably one of those things. I was caught with a phone on a regular basis. A word they found, you know, an illicit phone on a regular basis. I, I could, I lost count on how many phones I got caught with.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1388s)

So Todd, you literally were a normal, normal child, a normal kid. And this leader of the church, Roy Symington, who is a top dog, right, gets furious because he hears a young boy masturbates? Well buddy, you are, yeah, sorry. Well that is…

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1412s)

…then, then, then the thing is then you hear stories now coming out that you got men like him that have young women that make that woman, young underage woman touch their private parts and masturbate over them. Now how is that right?

Explain.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1436s)

Yeah, see, and that's the problem, right, is that they don't, they don't educate people on the physiological part and the maturity of puberty and what people go through. If they, if they had that education in there and they would educate people on what the body's responses are, what it wants to do and how it's not bad, it's not bad, we wouldn't get these older men doing that kind of crap, right? 

And that's the whole hypocrisy of it in this kind of a situation is here you are, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1466s) know, a young man that's got its desires and needs and all those kinds of things that happen with any human body without any education or anything behind it. And I mean, we hear about this often when people have masturbated and stuff, that they've got to stand up and they've got to be able to repent and they've got to hand it over to the priest. And those priests are sitting down there taking all this juicy information down and then those priests are turning around and having complete the most hypocritical behavior that happens behind the scenes. [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1496s).

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1496s)

Yeah, it's just, um, it really is sad.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1498s)

Why would you ever, why would you ever ask the child that question and ask them if they masturbate? That is wrong. It should be illegal. It is disgusting.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1518s)

Yeah, it really is. Um, so then, then I got to the age of like 17, 16, 17, then the whole psychiatrist thing came into the question. You know, obviously everybody had depression in there, everybody had anxiety in there. Um, and their best way of dealing with it was finding a psychiatrist that they could basically pay under the table and have him just dish out medications.

So I, I started taking medications and, you know, going to a psychiatrist, everything wasn't covered by insurance. So it was like endless money, pissing money away. Like, you know, like when I mean, pissing money away, I mean, you know, $300 to see him, $500 in medications a month, but that are not covered.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1570s)

Sorry to interrupt you, Todd. I, I just got a question. Did they tell you why they wanted you to go to a psychiatrist? Did they tell you that something was wrong with you?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1579s)

They told me that you have, um, ADHD is what they said. That's what the doctor pronounced it as. Um, every doctor I have, any psychiatry, any therapist I have seen since has said, that's a crock of, basically, you know, you, you were a normal human trying to have your desires and they were suppressing your desires.

So then, you know, I switched through psychiatrists, you know, they even had psychiatrists come to my parents' house and talk to each one of our, my brothers and sisters. Like we would sit in the patio and talk to them one after the other. It was like this fucking, you know, you're waiting for the bus, you know, okay, you're done, next one out. He'd get in his car and leave, write down numerous prescriptions and off he goes. Who paid for that? Me, me. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1638s) forced you to pay? Oh, I paid for everything. I paid for everything. Unbelievable. And now this is where the story starts getting really, you know, once the medication thing starts happening, this is where the story really um, then I, so then…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1648s)

One more question before you go on. Did you choose that psychiatrist or did they provide...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1653s)

They, they chose it. They chose it for me. That's very typical and it's usually extremely expensive. And a side note, I was never allowed to see a female doctor. I was told that was a no-no. Wow. Take that.

And I even got chastised for having a woman cut my hair at a barbershop. My father said that is a worldly woman touching your head. Explain that to me. These disgusting freaks.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1700s)

It's a small window into to the weird thoughts that go on in their minds. 

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1705s)

I look at my father, he produces 10 kids. So I don't know, you know, he obviously figured out the birds and the bees pretty quickly.

Sorry, honey, go on though. So then one of the times I was caught with the illegal phone, I unfortunately, it was a mistake on my part. I left it on my nightstand and my mother came to wake me up one morning and both phones were sitting next to each other.

Um, so they let me go and I, um, but I remember him, my father went into his room and said Todd has been caught with this and he's wanting to leave, because I was at that point trying to figure out a way of leaving. And, um, I still remember to this day, came to me, this was not long before he left, this was probably about eight months, and he said, why would you ever leave this beautiful position and and throw everything away? And within eight months, I realized he was gone.

Um, so, but anyway, they let me go to work. I was, I got to work, I got settled in and I was unloading a truck full of doors and, um, I got, I got somebody from the office came out and said you need, can you please go in there, they would like to have a meeting with you in Andrew Markham's office, which was Gilbert Markham's brother. And I go into the room and I have Andrew sitting in his desk, I [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1802s) Roy Symington sitting there. I have my father sitting there and I have, I believe, Dave Patterson sitting there.

And here's Andrew Markham, not much older than me. You know, we're probably only a few years different in age within five years.

And he's my boss. And they bring up, now this is a priestly, they bring up in his office that I was caught with an illicit phone and so we had a whole fucking meeting and everything and guess what Roy Symington ends up saying to me, he says, Todd, hand that illicit phone to Andrew and he will take care of it for you. For thinking I was doing what was right, I handed it over to Andrew Markham which was nobody at [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1851s) time, you know, I don't know what he is doing now, but and my father at that point was going to be going out with the, with a couple of the younger kids and my mom for the day. And Andrew said, you can go with your father for the day and I'll pay you for the day off. So I walked out of the office, went for a whole day with my father.

And the next day I continued at work and just kept working. And I still to this day don't know why I handed the phone over. You know, I do because I, you know, they were told, I was told to. Um, but then it really, that's really where the turning point was for me. Um, and then you know, time lapsed, you know, seeing psychiatrists, being put on four or five different medications, um, and uh, then probably about, this again, this was probably um, I got, I saw a different psychiatrist again. We changed psychiatrists because the one that we saw moved, moved out of town. He went to work for a military, the military or something. 

Um, so another psychiatrist that they saw, you know, I guess they probably had a meeting with him and, you know, paid him all kinds of money to do what he needed to do, which I never felt any help from anyway.

Once a month, I would see him and we would pretty much talk about the same shit. He would ask about how my family was doing and my brothers and sisters, which all saw him too.

And I have a younger brother that was seeing him as well.

And I remember the psychiatrist asking me about him quite a bit. We, me and him actually at home didn't get along very well. It wasn't anything personal, it was just probably because of the toxic, you know, family stuff, you know, there was no TV to watch, there was no radio to listen to, there was no nothing. You know, you sort of sat there and looked at each other and got pissed off at each other for day in and day out. Um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=1990s) unfortunately since we've left, we've actually come very, very close. Um, so it proves, proves to you what the environment of that cult does. Um, but so day in and day out, I saw him for years. Um, then this was before my other brother left in 2013\. Um, I was told my younger brother and we're not getting along very well. So [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2021s) of a sudden one day I was told I had to move out, shipped off to another older couple in the city because to make the family work is what they said.

Again, I was on four different medications and drinking very, very heavily because that's all they did in there, which there was never anybody telling me that, you know, you might not want to drink that alcohol because you know the medications you're on. 

Nobody ever stepped in and said that, not even the doctor, like, hey, this medication you're on, you might want to watch your alcohol consumption. Nothing. Just kept going. Um, so all of a sudden one one day I was whisked out of the house, packed up all my stuff, moved down to, I'm going to say their names because I don't think they were, they're alive anymore, um, [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2076s) what I know, uh, Keith and Mary Lock, which probably a lot of you know who they are, which they never had kids because, just a little side note here, she had some difficulties producing eggs, I believe. Now that I know what I know now, she never told Keith that she couldn't have kids before they were married. So they got married and he found out he would not be able to ever have children. So that's another thing there that irks me a little bit. So I [moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2113s) into their basement. I was not allowed to have a vehicle there. I was not allowed to have a personal phone. Um, so I shifted in there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2120s)

Were these the couple's rules, like this couple?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2122s)

No, no, this is rules I had. No, no, this is the rules the priest set out and my father set out. Um, so I had to get picked up every day and taken to work. And it was a long way for my father to come. Like it wasn't like, you know, three or four blocks away. It was a good 20 minute drive in the morning.

So I'd get picked up every day. I'd get dropped off from somebody that lived near there that I worked along with would drop me off. Which Keith was a pretty big pervert anyway.

And so then I lived there and it just was toxic. Endless just, you know, I, I was sitting in the window one day looking out, looking out the window, just enjoying the view and it happened to be a beautiful woman walked by, you know, jogging or walking by. Didn't realize it at the time, but Keith was standing behind me and said, Todd, what are you looking at that woman for? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2188s) I'm like, I turned around and I said, Keith, how do you know I was even looking at that woman? I said, I was looking at, I was looking out the window long before she even came into my view. 

So I said, that might be your, yours. You saw the woman and is and is putting the responsibility on me for looking out the window. So I said, stop blaming me for stuff. And it just never ended. You know, they tried to control what I drank there, like day in and day out. I could have one glass [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2218s) wine, uh, at a break. I remember one time there, I had a glass of wine at lunchtime on a Sunday break. We got invited out to John Markham's for Sunday dinner and I was told I could not drink any alcohol there. You know what I told you? You're in your 20s. Oh, I was, I was, I was late 20s at this point. I was well legal age to drink. There was no, it wasn't even a question of that.

And he said, you will not be able to drink any alcohol tonight at dinner because you've already had a glass of wine at lunchtime. And I said, Keith, I am not here because of an alcohol problem. I'm going to tell you, I don't really know why I'm here.

But I said, I am not here because I have an alcohol problem and you're not going to stop me from drinking. So guess what's going to happen? I am not going out for dinner tonight. I am going to my room and that's where I'm gonna be. Unfortunately, they never left. So I stopped them from going out to dinner. I said, screw it, I am now.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2279s)

They stopped themselves. They stopped themselves. But man, like the manipulation they try and put on an adult, that's mind-blowing.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2288s)

 And and then from Mary's side, she was a very unique individual. Um, and then it went on from there. Food I ate, I wouldn't eat some for vegetables sometimes. Like just, I didn't feel like a carrots, peas, whatever it was. I just didn't feel like them that night. And I, it just got worse and worse as I stayed there. So I, one night I, I didn't eat food. I, it's something that she made. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2318s) didn't want. And she's like, yeah, she got all pissed off and started screaming and hollering at me. Like, why won't you eat your food? I don't know how your mom ever did it. And I'm like, guess what? My mom never chastised me or blamed me because I wouldn't eat a vegetable. I just didn't feel like eating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2333s)

Are you how old at this point? I feel like...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2336s)

I'm probably in my late twenties.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2338s)

Like this is just ridiculous. I'd like treating you like a 10 year old.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2343s)

And then I said, I truly said to her, I said, Mary, my mom would not treat me this way because I didn't eat a vegetable she put out. I was like, remember we had 10 kids in our family. So everybody is, they're each individual human. They can choose what they want to eat. You know, my mom would tell me, you, you really need to eat some meat or, you know, something, you know, you can't just, you know, have a plate full of potatoes, you know, as a mom would do. Yeah, but remember this is not my mom.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2372s)

Yeah, I had no grown adult. You're a grown ass man.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2374s)

I'm a grown ass man. So, um, and she stormed out of the living room, she stormed out of the dining room, wouldn't even eat. So I said, I said to her, I said, guess what? I can see why God never gave you any kids. And Keith said, Todd, stop it. And I said, hey, I'm just stating facts. If she's going to treat me this way, how would she have been treating her children? And said, Todd, Todd, stop it. That, that's mean, that's mean. I'm like, Keith, nothing against you. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2404s) would have been a great father. But I said, her, I could see why God never gave her the ability to have children. You would not, I do not treat a human that way.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2412s)

Todd, when someone gets bullied over and over and over and they come out and say something mean back, guess what? That's life. It was words, okay? Don't feel bad about it. It was words.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2426s)

So then when I moved in there early, uh, another side note that she did, she tried to push me down basement stairs one time because of some other outrageous thing.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2436s)

I called my father. The story. What's that, tell the story.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2441s)

I don't even know what happened. I, I think again, it was something to do with food. I wouldn't eat food and she got up from the table and I was standing with my back to the basement stairs where I happened to be sleeping. And she literally pushed me, like literally forcefully pushed me and thankfully I grabbed the door frame and stopped myself from falling down 20 stairs. And it wasn't a big landing at the bottom. So I wouldn't have been, I probably would have ended up in the hospital, to be quite frank. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2470s) called my father and I said, Dad, this is outrageous. I'm coming home. And within an hour, my dad and Roy were at the doorstep calming me down. So I stayed there for another little while.

But when I was there, this is where things really start turning, um, well I mean they were pretty bad then. Um, I obviously still had a sex drive and still enjoyed, you know, women in general and that type of stuff. I got told I needed to go see Phil Truan in Detroit. Um,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2502s)

Now he's a brethren doctor, right?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2504s)

He was a brother doctor. He was a certified doctor, brethren. It was the same, it was all the same error as like Dr. Kirkpatrick and a couple other ones, Phil Craddock and, you know, that all pretty much you used and abused their powers of being a doctor. Yeah. Um, so I happen to just have surgery, I think on my foot or hand, my wrist actually. I had some, some kind of a surgery on my wrist, so I couldn't use my hand. So here's two grown adults trying to help me get [dressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2536s) that I don't even know. It's not my father, not my mother. So I'm like, you know, half naked trying to get dressed out of a shower and I can't use one hand because it's in a cast, which was very weird, unfortunately. Um, but I was flown out to Detroit on my dime. I paid my father, father's flight, my flight, rented a car, all on my dime, flew out to Detroit, drove to Phil Truan's house, all in a day. Phil flew out there, had, you know, never discussed any medications I was on, never discussed anything about it. Well, even if we did, he probably didn't know anything about the medications because he was probably drunk, but he wouldn't have known anything anyway. So he prescribes me this medication.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2584s)

And so, hold on, I got to pause you there for a second because this is a doctor prescribing you a medication without asking what other medications you were on.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2595s)

Yes. That is insane. And no, I was on four medications at the time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2602s)

Who prescribed those? Who prescribed your other medications? Was it the psychiatrist?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2607s)

Yeah, the psychiatrist. Yeah. For ADHD and all that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2610s)

And so it was the therapists that were chosen by the brethren that was prescribing you the medication?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2618s)

Which never accepted any insurance, so everything was paid out of my pocket. And at any given month, I could spend it close to $500 on medic, on medications. Um, so that, that was another thing. It was just like, I could never save money. It was just being pissed away, you know. And money was all controlled at, at one point, I didn't have any control over my bank accounts. It was actually a priest in the, in the brethren that had a full control over my bank accounts. My father and mother were, my father and mother were on the accounts to get me money.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2654s)

So they just come and take your bank cards away or?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2657s)

Oh, they just said, we're gonna, you know, to help you save money, [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2661s) gonna, you know, assign this man to your, to set up an account for you and this is where your money is going to be. I had no access to it. I had nothing. I didn't know anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2672s)

Did you sign anything to say, to say you approved that happening?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2676s)

Not, not really. I don't remember.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2678s)

No. So, so what they would have done is make the account in their own name and then claim that the money is his.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2683s)

Yeah. Um, and then my, when I needed cash, I would have to ask my father and think, what do you need it for? So I would, I would, um, give it, you know, he would give me his cash.

I was never allowed to carry a credit card and my father and if I needed it,um, my mom would have to give it to me. Um, she would control my credit cards.

Um, so I had this meeting with Roy Symington, Dave Patterson, my father, and they, before I went to see Phil Truan, and they had me sign all these documents about this medication that I was going to be prescribed, but I had to see Phil Truan in person before he prescribed this medication.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2731s)

So they made you sign documents before even prescribing it. Uh-huh. That's a big hint, folks listening right now. That's a big hint to try and make you sign some documents before a doctor even prescribed it to you. Something might be up. Um,

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2747s)

In the United States, we have this law, it's called a HIPAA law. And HIPAA wouldn't, would not accept that. So just, um, so I flew all the way out to Detroit, saw Phil Truan for 20 minutes, turned around, back to the airport I go with my dad…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2769s)

... What did he say in that meeting? Sorry. Do you remember anything he said? Did he prescribe or tell you the medication that you were going to be on, where they were going to get the medication from?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2779s)

So yes, they, he did go over the medication I was going to go on. Um, and he did state that it is, it is illegal in the United States. So we will be ordering it from England.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2792s)

Well, there you go folks. The doctor admits that the medication is fucking illegal. Sorry, go on.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2801s)

No problem. Um, so I fly back home with this prescription and here I am, I go on this medication for three, four years, something like that. I forget. I don't even know till I left. I was on it till I left. Um, sometimes I would stop it because I just knew.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2820s)

Um, you remember the name of it? Can you say it on here?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2823s)

I do not know. It starts with a C. I actually talked to Craig Hoyle, I think. Isn't he, he's another one that went on a, an [illegal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2831s) medication. Yeah, yeah, or something like that. Um, so it was a chemical castration medication, which it was, they didn't state that to me.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2838s)

So folks, I want to, I want to repeat what he just said because I want the listeners to clearly take that in. They put a young man on a chemical castration medication because he masturbated.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2857s)

And I had too high of a sex drive, I think is the name.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2860s)

No, you had a normal sex drive.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2862s)

Something like that, Rich. So then I went on this, but I was also told not to tell my psychiatrist the medication I was on. I was not allowed to tell any doctors what medication I was on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2882s)

Okay, so just for the record, HIPAA laws do not allow priests to administer paperwork for you to go and get med. They are not allowed to keep that paperwork and they are not allowed to administer paperwork like that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2895s)

And sorry, I interrupted Richard. I want Richard to say the name of the medication so we get that on the record.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2901s)

It's Cyprostat, C-Y-P-R-O-S-T-A-T.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2907s)

That actually sounds familiar. Yeah. The spelling of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2911s)

It basically changes all your hormones. So if you were on it for long enough, you would basically be completely feminized. You'd start growing breasts and your testicles would shrink and you would basically become feminized. You won't produce sperm.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2925s)

So Todd, is the reason why they placed you, is the whole issue they had with you, was it to do with your sex drive? Was it to do with what would be your natural sex drive? That's what their issue was with this whole time, was just your sex drive with porn magazines and you know,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2944s)

ridiculous. It's so heart-wrenching because you're how old at this point in time, do you know? I mean like this is just...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2952s)

…mid to late 20s. I've almost thought...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2954s)

This is, this is absolutely so heart-wrenching to know that this is the brain mentality that they have still in there because you, you said you're almost coming up to your six year anniversary of leaving, is that what you said?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2968s)

Friday, yep. And I actually do state this, I have not been on one single medication since I've left.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2974s)

Oh, I, I can imagine.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2975s)

I'm not either. I'm, all my antidepressants are gone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2978s)

And actually, all my therapists have told me you don't need them.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2980s)

So, yeah, I mean...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=2982s)

One thing, one thing just for, for people who've never been in the brethren that, you know, it's obvious to us, but it won't be obvious to you, is that of course you're not allowed to have a girlfriend in the brethren. If you're a young man in the brethren or a young woman in the brethren, you can't have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. You have to be celibate until you're married. And so this is the position Todd found himself in. He couldn't just do what every other normal person would [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3009s) and have a girlfriend, nor could he...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3013s)

Well, well, hang on. Yeah, go on. Hang on. I did have a girlfriend from 19 to about 20, 25\.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3022s)

But were you allowed to have any sexual relations with her?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3026s)

No. No, exactly.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3027s)

I can talk to her, that's not a... month.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3029s)

Well, her name was, she's actually not with us anymore. Her name is Janelle Devinish, which a lot of you probably know. I know Lane, you probably would know her. She passed away from breast cancer, unfortunately. Um, and that was not long after we split up and she, within four months, she was married and pregnant. So um, and unfortunately, the sickening part about that, they had a kid, the kid lived and within five months that man was married to her younger sister. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, anyway.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3063s)

Um, but, but the point is, you don't have a legitimate outlet for your natural feelings. So if people are saying judgmental goodness, wow, he was looking at porn and so on. Well, the guy couldn't have a girlfriend. He had no [legitimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3082s) outlet, no normal outlet for normal, natural, God-given feelings. Yeah.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3088s)

So then I was on this medication for quite some time, and I started growing lumps in my breasts.

Yeah, I bet you did. Very, very, very uncomfortable, I have to say, very uncomfortable. Um, I went and got mammograms, I went and got tests and there were these growths coming up. And and of course you were not allowed to tell the doctors. I did, I did tell the surgeon. I did tell the surgeon. I did, I did actually give the surgeon the name of it of what because he's like, I gotta know what's going on here. Like this is, these aren't just going to grow [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3126s) just lumps growing in your breasts. Like, come on. 

Like, and I just opened up to him. I'm like, this is the medication I'm on, FYI. But I was never allowed to tell my psychiatrist because I think about it, they could translate it and realize that something's fucked up here, excuse my French. Um, so then I went and saw a plastic surgeon because they were painful. They had to be removed. They were extremely painful. I went and had, went to [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3156s) plastic surgeon and got them removed. And I will tell you to this day, you would never see those scars. I would have to point them out to you to show you where they were.

So that again, plastic surgeon is not covered under insurance. So here again, I dropped $7,000 to get those lumps removed.

And the audacity here, I went to Dave Patterson and told him, because he's in the medical field, I said, this is not covered under insurance. And this cost me $7,000. Is there any way somebody can help me with that bill? Because it's not my fault, because it was this medication I was put on.

And you know what he turned around and said to me? You should have just used a general surgeon and it would have been covered under in, under insurance. Think about it for a minute.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3216s)

And like the, it's, I'm so sorry. I don't even have, like how you are still sitting here today talking to us and able to say it without even breaking down, man. I have so much respect for you. Like I just can't fathom what you went through, dude. It blows my mind what they did to you.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3240s)

It's uh, this is, I'll tell you one thing, the woman in my life is, once I opened up to her, she,because it's the audacity that he has to do something like that to an actual normal human.And unfortunately, Roy and Dave are just puppets in the show.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3260s)

Yes. And so, you know what, people ask us, you know, why do we, why do we go after BDH so much? Why is it always BDH's name that we use? Because he is the puppeteer. He is the one at the top that everybody answers to. So we could sit here, like he's the one, he has the one that, he's the one that has the power to change absolutely everything. He is the one calling the shots. He's the one calling the medications. He's the one calling and telling everybody. We know that from Heidi McCamley's stuff that he is the one that they go to [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3291s) the advice. They just get the direction. It is, it is everything. BDH is responsible 100% for every 53, 54 podcasts that we have done. BDH is, has to take responsibility for because he is the one that is in his Man of God position. He is the one that everybody answers to.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3308s)

Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, again, for those who haven't been in the Brethren, BDH is Bruce D. Hales, who's the current leader of the cult. And he has absolute final control over every single individual in that cult. But he will not take responsibility because he claims to be infallible. He pushes it off on somebody else, Richard. Yeah, he has scapegoats. Because he claims to be infallible, every time [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3338s) gets screwed up, he has to find someone else to blame, because being infallible, it can't be him. Yeah, so, yeah, we're calling him out. We're telling him where the buck stops.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3347s)

Yep. Well he brings back people that he uses as his fixer and Roy happened to be one of those fixers. He brought Roy back when his, his own family said they would have nothing to do with the man. He was so evil.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3361s)

Yeah, he would throw temper tantrum. I legitimately wouldn't have anything to do with him anyway if it was my [father.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3369s) Yeah, your description of him with the flames coming out of his eyes is, is so familiar. And his own kids would tell you that. But Bruce needed him. He needed a fixer. So he brought him back. He is somebody in this. Despite the fact that I had 25 court cases against him. You know, usually in their world, you would not be allowed to sit through a meeting with a court case pending against you. And Roy had 25 and he brought him back so that he could continue to torture everybody. [Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3399s) he was sent all the way up to Regina to chew me out. Yeah, and yeah, I mean, he's an ugly guy when he's happy. But when he's in a bad mood, those little piggy eyes go blood red. Boy, it's an ugly sight. Satan himself, eh? Looks like a pot-bellied pig.

**Todd Coulter**

Yeah.

Um, so yeah, so then Roy really had nothing to do with that. I never really talked to him about that surgery and that, because I went to Dave Patterson because, you know, he had the medical, you know, he was in the medical business and, you know, he had, you know, maybe waste of getting around that. But then it just kept going, you know, same thing, day in, day out, you know, masturbation, you know, priestlies and, you know, you know, stay in the clear, everything will work out, your pay [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3450s) get better, you know, things will work out, you'll get married. And I tried it for a couple years and it just didn't work. I was like, this is like, that's the whole thing is a crock of, I'm sorry, I've talked.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3462s)

And did they keep you on this medication? That's what, so you're still on the medication at this time?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3469s)

Oh yeah, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3471s)

Even after you've had surgery, they kept you on the medication?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3473s)

They kept me the medication. And and they told me, if you get married, you can come off the medication.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3481s)

How did they get the medication to you?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3483s)

So it came, it was ordered from somebody, some distribution center in England or Great Britain, somewhere, I don't know what country, but it was England, I think. Yeah. And and that cost, that cost to get like a three-month supply was like 500 bucks.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3501s)

And you paid for this?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3503s)

Yes, out of my pocket.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3505s)

Was there a doctor in England that prescribed it or?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3507s)

No, Phil Truan described, prescribed it. And I guess he knew the ways of getting it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3512s)

So that's my question, can a doctor from America have prescribing authorities in the UK? So anybody that's in that medical field could you know, message us and let us know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3523s)

I know, I know an American doctor cannot prescribe in Canada, and a [Canadian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3533s) doctor cannot prescribe in America. So it's not least, it seems...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3537s)

I don't know how they, obviously never told me how they, how they, how they would acquire it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3542s)

So was this actually shipped to your door like FedEx?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3547s)

Shipped directly to my house, my parents' house. Wow. Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3552s)

Okay. Keep on going on.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3555s)

No. So, so then, then the surgery happened and, you know, recovery and, you know, same thing, same bullshit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3561s)

They tell you that you can get married.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3564s)

Yeah. They, I could get married, you know? So then, you know, me and Janelle, Janelle Devenish were going together at that. We split up before that. And that was all guidance from BDH. Um, so we, we were going together for a number of years. I was 19 and she was 17\. She happened to stay at our house. She knew my sisters quite well. And that's actually how we got a liking for each other. And we started talking and then we were controlled. Minute, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3595s) knew we liked each other. It was, you could talk once a month for 15 minutes. And, you know, then finally in 2007, January 2007, we went up to Edmonton. My parents, me, my sisters, believe another one of my brothers went up there for a weekend fellowship meeting or something like that. I forget what it was.

I stayed at her house, but she had to go stay at her aunt's house at night because they were worried we were going to do something.

So then it was just like the same thing. You could sit next to each other, you couldn't hold hands, you couldn't give her a hug, you couldn't, you know, none of the, you know, romantic, you know, what uh, in a relationship you should be able to do. Um, then we went to Jasper for a day and me and Janelle were sitting next to each other and we were doing stuff, you know, under blankets and because of winter time, it was January. Um, we landed up there, just step back a couple. 

We landed there and me and her sat next to each other and there wasn't enough room for all the suitcases. So we put a suitcase on our lap, which gave us the chance to hold hands. My sister is next to me, she saw us holding hands under the suitcase. [She](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3679s) went and told my dad. My dad came and said, why were you holding Janelle's hand? I'm looking at her, I'm like, well, isn't that what you're supposed to do in a relationship?

 Um, so then it just really started, you know, you know, we hung, hang out, we could never be by ourselves, we couldn't be, you know, what it was, you know, like a, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend could do. At one point, I was thinking about moving up there, um, relocating [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3709s) get married and relocate and live up there. Um, but that ended. I shipped all my money up there. Calvin Devenish actually held the most of my money for a good couple years.

And it just never happened. It never. So we shipped it all back. And then BDH was in Vancouver and her uncle, Janelle's uncle, Calvin Devenish, set up a meeting with, for Janelle, because we were out of state, you know, we wanted to get married and we wanted to proceed.

And um, she talked to him as he was leaving Vancouver and he said, sever your connections and get the Lord's mind. So she wrote a letter to me. I actually had bought her her ring and everything, like an engagement ring or a birthstone ring. She shipped everything back to me and wrote it in letter, in writing that this is what BDH said. And I already knew at the time that there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3776s) a guy up there that had the hots for her. Um, I forget his name, Jeremy something or other.

Um, so I already knew and I told her, tell him if he does anything with you, I'm gonna kick his ass. Like, no, you're mine. This is it. Anyway, BDH said this, so she ended the relationship just like that. No questions, no, like, no, this is not right. I love this man. I want to be with him. I want to be married to him.

And within six months, she was married.

I think it was within six months, she was married to this man. He had bought a house and BDH approved it and off they went. They got pregnant with their first child. And I was actually living at Keith and Mary Lock's at the point at that point and I heard that she had breast cancer and she was pregnant. She was very close to about eight months pregnant and they thankfully, the baby, they get, they [brought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3838s) the baby and within four weeks, she was, she passed away. The breast, the cancer took over. And I heard this, I wasn't even at home and I heard this, that my sister called me or something. Um, so she was passed away and then within six months, I hear that he's marrying her younger sister because she was taking care of the son and BDH said they should get married. So now they have [kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3868s) together. Think about it, it's like this family affair just going through sisters like you know.

So it's just like one of those things. So it's just like, you'll be whatever BDH says goes, you know.

So then I moved on from that, you know, obviously she still holds a special place in my heart because I really did love her and I did care about her, but you know, she's not with us anymore. Um, so then just things just kept spiraling out of control, you know, just, you know, I, I was at a point that I let my parents put a tracker on my vehicle because they didn't believe anything that I said and what I was doing, nothing, absolutely nothing. 

Um, I would have, I had to start calling when I left work [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3919s) they could track how long it would take me to get home because they sort of knew how long would take. I would have to call when I got to work. Um, so I started being able to play the system and leaving, knowing I wanted to go do something, I would leave and then when I got to my next appointment or, you know, whatever I was going to do, I called from there and said, hey, I'm leaving work. And I would be able to drag it out and, you know, sort of pass time that way. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3950s), but then it just got, but then I got so angry one night, I threw my phone across the bedroom because my parents challenged me about something.

 I forget what it was, but they challenged me about something that wasn't true. And I just got frustrated and threw my phone across the UBT phone, threw it across and the thing obliterated into a million fucking pieces. Good. And so I was like, I need a phone. My parents wouldn't give me another one. So I said, screw it. I'm going to go to Verizon, which that's who my carrier was, and I've got [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=3980s) phone, fully opened, unlocked phone, nothing. I was like, screw it, this is mine, I'm doing it. Um, they couldn't try, it was still under my number, but they couldn't track it. I found that out.

But then I knew I had an open phone, so I felt I was doing something guilty, unfortunately. Yeah. Um, so then they had this thing that they could put on new phones that they could track everything. They could set up an app or something, I forget what it was called. So I set it up because obviously I was doing my stuff on there, you know, watching YouTube videos and watching porn and, you know, doing what guys do, single guys do. And, you know, um, so then I met, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4023s) was in 2016\.

Uh, 2017, actually, early 2017\.

Um, I met a woman at a rest area. Unfortunately, it was right down the street from where I worked. And we started chatting and, you know, we exchanged numbers and, um, I never had her where she lived, but um, she would look, she wanted to meet me and I was like, maybe this is my way out. I knew I was at a point where I just like, I have to be free. I, I can't live my life like this because I knew I wouldn't get married in there. I was at a point where, you know, I was told by my father, you're too old, no, no woman's gonna want you, you're too old.

 So I'm like, okay. Um,um, so, um, it happened to be a Thursday night. I was heading, I told my father the night I was leaving, I told my father, I'm bringing my vehicle, I'm  extremely tired, I am going to go to church, I'm going to leave right after church and go home. And in the meantime, heading up to church, I was texting with this woman trying to get her address and figure out where we could meet and, you know, yada yada. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the app that [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4095s) put on there, they could track every text message and every phone call that you did. 

So I'm on my way to meeting Thursday night, tearing up the road and I get a call from my father and I'm like, well, I don't know what, I figured I sort of started reading between the lines and he's like, we just realized you're texting with this worldly woman, what is going on here? So I said, that, I'm done. I literally did not go to meeting. I got on the [highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4125s) and I just started heading west, fuck it. I said, I'm done. This is it. This is the point, turning point to me, I'm done. So I stopped at it, I happened to go right by where I worked and I knew there was an Applebee's down the road. Um, so I stopped there and I had a couple beers, um sitting at the bar and this lady called me. Unfortunately, we got disconnected and I never got to talk to her again.

So I never did meet up with her. But I'm like, I'm at this point now.

I figured the only way out is to go have intercourse with somebody. I don't care who it is, just somebody, because I figured if I did that, I'd get withdrawn from.

So I went to a strip club and I'm like, I'm this far now, let's go. So I went to a strip club and hung out. Unfortunately, it was across state lines, so they put a hold, my bank account put a hold on my credit card because I was, most of the time if you don't notify them, they'll put a hold on your account. So I went all out. I was in, you know, VIP. I was, you know, rocking up the bills in the bottle service, having the time, you like, yeah. And I knew I could have, I knew I could have, I knew I had what, I knew, you know, credit limit I had on my card, so I knew I could pretty much run that up. Unfortunately, you know, we were starting to, you know, go up to the VIP and they needed to run the card and it was frozen. So because I used that card to pay to get into the club, didn't realize it was frozen. So the only one that would unfreeze that is my father.

So I'm like, fuck this. I'm calling my father. Unfortunately, he still had the tracker on my phone. So he knew exactly where I was.

So I said, listen, I need the passwords to unlock this so I can talk to the bank. I need to pay this bill and I'm coming home. Nope. I'm not giving you that card. I know where you are. I'm coming to get you. I'm like, father, you're not going to come out here and get me. I know that you will not find me by the time I, by the time you get here, I will not be here. I can guarantee you that. So I knew at that point, I'm turning off the phone. I figured that's the best way because once the phone is off, they can't track it. 

Yeah. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4265s), unfortunately, I never did, I never did, um, pay that woman. They, my father refused to give me the accounts and I never paid that woman. So it's, so we never ended up doing anything. It never did end up going. You're forgiven. You're free. Um, but you know, I felt bad about it. I held this lady up all night. And, um, so then [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4295s) slept in my car overnight because it was a decent drive home. It was probably about two hours away. So I slept in my car overnight and then I, um, I figured I've gone this far, what can I do just to seal the deal? So I went to a massage parlor the next morning. I knew what time they opened, I knew which one I could go to to get what I needed to get. So I, so I went there and I, I thankfully, I did get all [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4325s) account information so I could withdraw cash. So I drew cash, went and did what I did.

And I needed clothes. I didn't have clothes. So I was like, screw it. This was a Friday morning. I went home, went into my bedroom. And my father stayed home from work. He was doing work from the kitchen table. So I stayed in there, got sleep, did what he did. So I went home and then my dad came into my room at some point, Friday night or Saturday or something, and said, you need to write everything down that has happened, and you know, I'm going to go to the priest about it. So I did and [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4363s) I did and uh, within 24 hours on Saturday, I um, I figured I'd go home, I'd go down and get, I needed lunch. 

So I went to a restaurant and got lunch and I got a call from my father saying, I need you home, we have a place for you, you have to move out, we have a place for you to go. So I went, I went home, packed up some stuff. My father had rented a hotel room for me [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4394s) I went there and I, um, that's the really the beginning of it. I mean, the beginning of my new life. Um, so then I just started getting harassing emails, you know, emails from different members because I had already got a new phone and a new email address.

And my father already knew it. So he was handing it out to like, you know, older people in the church that I knew that I may have gotten along with. And I started getting all these emails from them, you know, sending me quotes of scripture and, you know, stuff like that. And so for the first two months, I lived in a hotel, you know, because I didn't, I quit my job because I was like, I'm, you know, where my brother lived, I had, it's a peeb business, so they were all there. 

So it was going to be, I couldn't start a new life being there because it would have been too much [pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4445s). Yeah, yeah. Um, so I just quit the job. I didn't go back. Um, so I started racking up credit card bills, you know, running myself out of money, which I didn't have a lot of it anyway, because I never was paid very much. Um, and then I, um, so then things, I finally reached out to my brother. I found him through social media. Um, and that's really when things started changing. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4475s) was able to get some money from him to pay for my first place to live.

And I found a job. And then, about three weeks later, I met the woman I am with now. She was renting in the apartment below me. We bumped into each other. And, you know, we started chatting and we've been together ever since.

I have an amazing job now, um, and you know, I am, I'm here today.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4511s)

You just need to be compensated for all those years that you had to pay for your own prescriptions.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4514s)

Um, yeah. But, but I, I actually, a side note, I, so in 2000, I had just left recently. BDH must have come through in about 2018\. My father must have had a meeting with them and they decided to withdraw from me.

Um, early on, then I did say to my father, I said, father, did you look into those meds, that illegal medication to see what it was going to do to me before you approved that them putting your son on that? And he said, no. And I said, father, do you realize that was killing me? And he said, they did it out of love. Oh, he wouldn't, he wouldn't let us not make it all right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4556s)

That does not make it okay no matter what emotion you felt doing it.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4560s)

It was illegal. Yeah. So I said to him, I was like, father, that is not love. Yeah, that's control. It's not love. Yeah. Um, so then in 2018, he wanted to have a meeting with me because obviously BDH said that we would withdraw from you. So I said, fine, we'll have a meeting. I was like, would you want to go to like a Starbucks or a Dunkin' Donuts or something to sit down? He's like, me and mom want to meet you, you know, somewhere. And I was like, fine, we can [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4590s) meet in the morning and have a cup of coffee and chat. I have no problem with that.

 So my brother came with me, um, because obviously they like numbers, they like to come and, yeah, I have two or three guys and, or guys, girls, whatever they are. So he's like, no, we'll just meet in a parking lot. I'm like, great, that's a great way to have a meeting, meet in the middle of a parking lot. You know, four guys standing outside this car jabbering away and, you know, people driving by like, who the, what the hell is going on here? Why don't you go into the Dunkin' Donuts? So [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4621s) pull up and my brother, my, we pull up and my mother's not in the vehicle. So I'm like, okay, I guess something changed. 

My father gets out and says, mother couldn't make it. It had been too difficult for you, for her to see you. I was like, okay. So I walked up to my father and tried to give him a hug and he pushed me away. He said, I cannot hug you due to your position. I was like, okay, no problem. If that's what you want to be. But my older brother, my older brother, my oldest brother was [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4651s) as a witness. Um, so he went and stated what we were gonna do, you know, withdraw from you based on 2 Timothy 2 or whatever the crock of shit is. I don't fucking care at this point. Um, it's all just words to me anyway. 

And I said, that's fine, no problem father, I knew it was coming, I had no problem with that. But I said, can I say one thing? He's like, yeah. And I said, father, the one thing that's wrong with, with the, the brother, I said, is you have to go through a man to get to God, have your link with God. Yeah. And I said, that is not right. I said, I can have my own link with God. And he said, Todd, I'm stopping you in your [tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4700s), I'm not talking about it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4703s)

That, folks, is what a father says to a son that is being completely brainwashed since birth. They choose their faith and their stupid beliefs over their own children. It's disgusting. And they call it a beautiful Christian mainstream church. A family, family. What they did to Todd.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4733s)

Yeah. So values of, what is it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4735s)

Love, care, and compassion.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4737s)

Something like that. So then, you know, unfortunately, me and my brother, oldest brother look almost identically. You would think we were twins. And so when we went, my younger brother's wife was with us in another vehicle with my fiance now because they wanted to see my father and my brother.

And we look so similar that my fiance now couldn't pick me and him out. He thought, they couldn't recognize. So that's how similar we look. But, you know, I asked, I asked him how, how his kids, wife and kids were doing. And, you know, it was sort of just a blanket statement.

So then we sort of just went back to the vehicle and left. You know, we at that point we went to a restaurant and hung out and had some drinks and stuff. But it was just like, yeah.

But that, that's really where the end was.

And then it just, I sort of found my new life. You know, I have an amazing woman in my life now. She would take a bullet for me. She would do whatever it took to take care of me and vice versa.

But, you know, I really don't talk to my father ever, neither my mother.

Um, and unfortunately that is, I felt that it's easier that way than, because every time I have talked to him, it's the same, you know, that's hard, we're praying for you and...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4835s)

Yeah.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4836s)

Yeah, yeah. Um, so yeah, it's, uh, it's been a journey, I have to say, but, um, it has been an amazing experience. So…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4848s)

How long did it take you to come off of those medications? Obviously you left and did you come immediately?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4852s)

I stopped the medications immediately, yeah. Um, I stopped the illegal one, you know, a little bit, you know, I would get off it for, you know, a few weeks and then all of a sudden, you know, something would come up and like, oh, I better get back on this medication. And, um, um, it was, um, but I can see now what I know now is why there is so many screwed up, yeah, marriages, relationships in there because there is no health education, there's no sex education.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4887s)

And prescriptions like this should not be handed out and this legally needs to be dealt with. And so I would love for every, Bruce, when you're watch this, just know this will all legally be dealt with. This is, this is not okay. You cannot, you cannot be given permission for this kind of thing to happen and it legally needs to stop. We legally need to do something about this so that this does not continue.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4911s)

Yeah, agreed. You know, and I just want to put this out there, Todd, like we've gotten to know each other over the last couple months and you know, I've heard your story and and I am amazed at what a loving, kind person you are after all that you've been through. You're the nicest. You send the nicest messages to everybody, all your friends, all the time. You are just [positivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4941s) and love. And after what you've been through, to be so full of love, Todd, after what you've been through, it restores my faith in human beings. Because that's what I think.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=4950s)

I try to. I've, I've come to what I have come to is that I need to be, nobody needs to be treated the way I am. I need to be a very positive, I try to be as positive person, sometimes it's very hard to be, but I try to be as positive a person, and try to just send as much love as I can to anybody.

And just give somebody a hug, say hello to somebody, tell them, you know, we love you, you know, and in there, that is so wrong. Like I remember one time in there, my cousin, we were doing work at her house, and she was down about something. So I just put my hand on her shoulder and tried to say something positive to her. And the look I got from her, that I actually put my hand on a woman on her shoulder, no not, not like on the butt or [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5000s) know, nothing, on her shoulder, and I felt like it was, this look I got, I felt like I did something awful. Yeah, I get the same thing. Um, so I just, I try to, I tell my therapist the same thing. I've come in contact with an amazing therapist that has, you know, I've only talked,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5015s)

Makes all the difference, doesn't it?

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5016s)

Yeah, she has been an amazing help. Um, so yeah, I try to be, you know, send as much love out to people. Um, obviously everybody [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5034s) is left, um, all has, you know, challenges and difficulties and, um, we all have challenges in life, but what I've, what I've taken from coming out is try to show as much love as you can. Try to, try to tell somebody, say hello to them. Like I even at work, I always thank somebody for how hard they've worked for me. 

I, I go through and say goodbye to every person in the office before I leave, if they're there. Um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5065s) in the morning I try to go in and say, how you doing, say hello to all the guys, my bosses, everything. I just try to be a positive person towards my customers and it just, amazing. It's, I feel it's the only thing I can do to somebody, some of the stories I've heard and people have come in contact that have left,just to show them, you know, tell them, you know, we love you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5091s)

It really is about us banding together though, isn't it? Like it really is. It's, I find that too, some of the greatest solace comes out of those messages when two, three of us are all hurting together. And we just, because we understand what that, the heartache that that other person is coming, is going through, that it is really, truly about us coming together. And it takes a village. It literally does take a village for us to be able to create [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5121s) break through what we need to break through with this movement. I have no doubt in my mind, no doubt in my mind anymore that we won't accomplish what we set out to accomplish.

BDH needs to be held accountable. That is the whole purpose of this, is accountability has to happen because without accountability, no change can happen. And it isn't about, this isn't about destroying the PBCC. It's not about that. But there are awful, horrific things and practices that they have in there that need to be stopped. BDH needs to be held accountable and it needs to become just a mainstream Christian church. That's what it needs to come.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5159s)

Right now, I have no problem...

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5161s)

I have no problem with no, with general Christians, no. But it's what it's led into, like, and I've said this to plenty of people, when in the 90s, I don't remember it like this, you know, you, they were like general Christians and, you know, like you read the Bible more and all that. But like as BDH took over, it was more about reading the white books. They pushed the white books, his ministry pushed his ministry and, and it wasn't all about the Bible anymore. It was about what he said, what he talked about, what his sons [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5192s) about, you know, what they did in business, all of a sudden business seminars, you know, you know, look what he does, look what, you know, and it just became so commercialized. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5206s)

Even from, go ahead, Richard.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5208s)

No, it was, I was just going to say it's human worship, right? It's human worship. That's what it is, that's what it's become. But that's been around for thousands of years, but I think under Bruce Hales, yes, the cult became even more prominent in its worship of, of a human.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5223s)

Right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5224s)

And it's really gross in this day and age to have that level of worship of a human being.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5230s)

Along with greed, right? Like they become so greedy.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5234s)

Yeah. Well that's, that's the other thing. I still remember dumping all this money into these baskets and you like giving the care, care meetings and the amount we would give and most of it, good portion of it would go to BDH every month. Yep. And it was just like, you know, where is, where's the your own concern for your own family, your own, you know, everything was about what you're going to put in that basket. And you know, I take Abi Thompson or whatever her story, you know, when she told and how she broke down because she came out so recently, it has become like a business. Yeah. It's not about Christianity and, you know, trying to spread good word. It is all about business and how they can make [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5281s) much money and suck everything out of any individual in it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5286s)

And some people don't have it. I mean, we have, we talk to people that are just being bled dry.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5292s)

I don't know how my father did, I don't know how my father and mother did it because my father was, he worked, he worked very hard but he never made anything. I mean, I don't know what he made but I could tell you right now he didn't make him make a lot. But he, you know, I wouldn't be where I was and act like I'm acting now if it wasn't for my father. I give him that credit. Yeah. Um, and I don't blame my leaving on my father. I blame it on the church. I don't believe him because of him. Um, unfortunately, he is very brainwashed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5320s)

Exactly. They're just a product of the, yeah, they're product of their environment.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5325s)

Yeah. They're very brainwashed. And I want to touch on a point before we close out today.

And that's about masturbation. Okay.

It's totally normal when done privately. Okay.

There's nothing wrong with it. If you're in the brethren and you are wondering if you, why you want to look at girls so much and you're a young boy, that that's a normal feeling. Okay. I'm not telling you to go look at it or anything. I'm just saying that's normal. Also, if you're above 18, you're allowed to have sex, consensual sex, but use protection. Be smart. And let me tell you a little secret. At no point do you need a piece of paper signed [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5372s) front of judges or God's blessing on having sex. Consensual adult sex is completely fine and healthy, and you're allowed to do it long before you get married. 

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5383s)

And actually on that note, I have to say, I have felt so much better. Um, and actually my fiance has known a major difference from the first time we, we metfrom all the medications I was on to what I am at now. Yeah, she, you could, it's night and day. And, and it is an amazing, it just shows you what God made. That's what they made him for. Like that's, you know, to have that consensual sex, it is healthy for you. It's actually good for your body.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5427s)

Yes. That's what I've learned since I've left. Yeah. It's great for your [endorphins.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5430s) It's actually very healthy for you.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5434s)

Um, I gotta add something else today. I just want to speak directly to members that are still inside that feel the urge to say things to us. Death threats are taken very seriously. They're, they're given to the police immediately. If you, if you send a death threat to any one of us, we have to contact the authorities immediately. And it helps paint a picture of how crazy the [cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5465s) is. If you send harassing comments and emails that are disgusting and allegations completely false, we have to send these on to the police and they actually help paint a picture of how incredibly sick some of you are in there and you need help and you need to talk to therapists about it. But there's no room for harassment or death threats. We won't tolerate it at all.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5494s)

We don't, we, a note there at Lane, we don't do it to them.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5498s)

Exactly. We don't send them mail like that or letters or emails.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5503s)

No. I surely tell the truth. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5509s)

We tell, no, and for a Christian community, some of the stuff, some of the emails we get and some of the messages that I have to take off of YouTube are pretty violent. And just so you, when you go underneath anonymous names, the police can figure out who you are, right? So that all has been sent, everything that comes our way. So when anybody sends stuff our way, it immediately goes to the police, right? So we're not, anything that's...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5534s)

Anything that's harassing, we're not replying to you...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5536s)

We're not going to engage in your, in, in this, this stuff. It just goes straight to the police. So just so you know that when we don't reply to you, it's because it's gone to the police and we're not going to engage in it. It's just, that's not what this is about. This is about that's what I've been abused coming on and telling their stories and whatever you've been told in there, whatever goes on in there, and I know Bruce gets you guys riled up with this whole removal and praying for everybody's [deaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5567s), right? I understand that that probably puts pressure on you, but you have to ask yourself, is that what a true Christian does? Does that show care and compassion? Because that's what you guys stand for. You guys stand for this care and compassion. That isn't care and compassion. So you need to have care and compassion for those people that are on here.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5585s)

I agree. And we know, we've heard all about these prayers that things are going to end for us. And I want to say, if they are working, they're working in very mysterious ways because a guy came up to me yesterday and handed me a cigar on the street for free, and the margaritas, the pool and the Caribbean sun, God is really punished me, me in very mysterious ways.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5612s)

Cheers.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5615s)

Yeah, but they've had all these extra special prayers and prayer meetings apparently that we're going to be removed. And I, I did have a slight headache the other day, so maybe, maybe, maybe something's getting through, but they'd have to try a little bit harder.

Yeah. No, that was the prayers hitting the ceiling and coming back down. That's what made me mad.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5642s)

Just clarifying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5643s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5644s)

You know, I believe what you put out into the world is exactly what you will get back. If you put out hatred, judgment, if you hate the world, well, guess what? The world's going to hate you back and it won't be comfortable. You know, if you put love out into the world like Todd is, okay, his friendship and his love that he just pours out of them, that's why he's doing so great. That's why he's fucking loving life.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5670s)

You know what's gonna happen? The brethren are gonna pray and pray and pray for wicked people to remove and then one day Bruce Hales is gonna disappear. They'll never be able to figure out why.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5679s)

And you guys did it, right? Like I mean, that's the whole thing is that you got to be watching when you're praying for evil people that you know, people might start dropping left, right and center in there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5688s)

You might get what you asked for.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5690s)

Well, sorry, I had to.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5693s)

That's all right. That's okay.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5696s)

I just wanted to add on that when I got back on, um, you know, people, I think about it quite a bit. Why is there so much sickness in there? Why, really think about it. How many people, like my father texted me a few times about somebody passing away from cancer or something like that. And I'm like, but then I have a brother and sister that got married in there, you know, and I'm like, why can't, I said to him, why you tell me about this? Why can't you tell me something positive about [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5726s) family?

And he's, no reply. But there, if you think about how many people have come down with illness, sickness, cancer, something, you know, and they always try to have an excuse for it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5741s)

It's the stress, it's the abuse.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5742s)

It's the stress and the pressure of their lifestyle, 100%, 100%.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5746s)

Yeah, I agree. There's no doubt about it. I mean, you could, doctors could prove us right on that. I mean, it's...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5753s)

There's been studies, okay? You can make yourself sick with hatred, okay? It's absolutely possible.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5761s)

Yeah. Hatred is an acid. It does more damage to the vessel it's stored in than the vessel it's poured on. Yeah. Very well said. Very well said. We'll exit it out at that point.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5773s)

Well, thank you so much, Todd. We really appreciate you coming on and sharing your story. Um, I, I just got to process it. I, I think that we will see in the near future, um, ways to be able to hold accountability, um, for situations like yours. I, I know that this will go somewhere. I have, I don't have any doubt in my mind.

### [**Todd Coulter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5797s)

I just hope, I just hope, like I told Lane privately, I hope all I hope is that somebody in there that might be going through the same thing or very similar, just to bring some awareness to it. I'm not here to judge anybody, but it's got to be awareness so it stops. It's exactly, you know, I'm not out here to start pointing fingers at everybody. Obviously, we know who's wrong, yeah, but if you don't have some awareness towards it, you know, I'm not out here to try to, you know, pick a fight or any of that. I'm more trying to bring awareness to what has happened and what is still happening.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5830s)

And awareness brings change, right? That's the whole key is we're trying to bring this change. We have, there has to be change in there. And because our families are in there, right, we can see it now that we're out. And that's why it's super important for, we are their voice right now, right? That's what it comes down to is we are those people's voice. So, I mean, in this case, if you're taking the drug that Todd was put on, don't take it. Like, do not, that's horrible, horrible, horrible for your system. Don't take it and you don't have to take it. But yes, okay, thank you so [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2UWP-ntXWs&t=5862s), Todd. We really, really appreciate you very much.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
