## Summary

This podcast is a 2 part series, Ep. 74 and 75, where ep.75 extends into Richard's story and rebuttal of their accusations.
The battle of Barrington ended in a resounding victory for the residents as the PBCC fled the field in disarray. Never a cult to accept defeat graciously, they then lashed out at their critics in a series of newspaper articles, social media posts and a dedicated website. Having told the Barrington Residents a month ago “We long to become your neighbors” the PBCC now accuses them of “shameful behavior” and “religious bigotry”, and claims that the opposition to their giant 2000 seat meeting hall, school and superstore was “instigated by CONVICTED LIAR Richard Marsh”.
Lynette Diener, Get-a-Life’s indomitable representative in Illinois was on the spot with her camera at the fractious public meeting where the conflict reached its dramatic conclusion – making for a truly riveting podcast!

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=7s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we are joined by Carman and Richard and we have Lynette on again. We are going to dive in very thoroughly to the Chicago Barrington meeting room deal that was cancelled and unravel a lot of the lies that the PBCC set forward, as they always do. So we're going to jump literally [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=38s) into it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=39s)

The story up till now is that the Chicago Brethren congregation have been trying to purchase a 33-acre site for a meeting hall in the Chicago suburb of Barrington. This proved highly controversial. The residents didn't want them there.

The story to date is that there have been two public meetings where the Barrington residents are meeting with their councillors. At the first public meeting, the Brethren presented their plan, and the residents also spoke opposing the plan, which I think took the Brethren by surprise.

Now, before the second public meeting happened, the Brethren tried a very sneaky move. They tried to close the deal the day before the second public meeting took place to kind of forestall or preempt any further opposition.

The residents got themselves a lawyer and managed to get an emergency injunction halting the sale. So at the second public meeting, it was very tense because suddenly litigation was involved. The residents were, well, they'd got a hold on the sale and potentially they were suing their own councillors for the way that they had proceeded.

So the Brethren responded with some very vicious articles and a website they published accusing the Barrington residents of religious bigotry and all sorts of nastiness. These are the Barrington residents that they had been kind of trying to woo and saying, "Yes, we are longing [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=163s) be your neighbors." And the minute they get pushback from the residents, they turn against those same people and accuse them of all kinds of misbehavior, which is completely false, completely unfounded.

So that's the point we kind of reached, you know, more or less at the end of our previous podcast about this. And then the thing we're specifically covering today is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=193s) there was a third public meeting, which Lynette was at, which was very dramatic, and that's what we're going to show you recordings of today.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=210s)

So on your screen you'll see, actually go back to the first one, this is an article by the Daily Herald, and the title is,

 "Bullying, threatening critics led South Barrington Park board to cancel land deal, officials say.  
 In a statement issued Thursday, Fourth Avenue's Russell McAbery said the group is disappointed the Park District breached its agreement to sell the land. McAbery also accused opponents of the group's plan of religious bigotry and called their actions shameful.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=240s)

So the result of this third meeting we're talking about today is that one of the councillors resigned and the other councillors voted unanimously to cancel the deal to sell the land to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Now, they didn't go down gracefully. They all voted unanimously to cancel it, but at least two of the councillors gave some quite unpleasant speeches attacking their own residents, their own constituents, [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=280s) connection with the matter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=282s)

The second article that I pulled up here, it says;

 "’During the park board meeting, the commissioners each spoke at length about the upstanding character of our congregation and how fairly and openly we conducted ourselves through this process. These positive testimonies confirm that those attacking Fourth Avenue did so on the basis of religious bigotry, not fact,’ Russell McAbery wrote in the statement.”

 So we were going to play these videos for you, and I want you guys to [view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=312s) for yourself whether you think this was religious bigotry.

I guess one of the biggest things that frustrates me in all of this, just by pointing this out, is that they resorted back to calling themselves their Gospel Hall Trust hall names instead of PBCC. Like, you notice all throughout the world now we had that graveyard desecration thing. They were using the gospel trust name there. This one, they're using the gospel trust name. And that's just been recent. That's not been a current thing, right, Richard?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=337s)

Yeah, it suddenly happened this year that on their planning applications they're actually concealing the fact that they're Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which is shocking. It means that their newly minted brand of Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which they only invented in 2012, is now so tarnished that they don't dare use it and they kind of hide behind the names of their individual gospel hall trusts.

And I mean, just in connection with that last extract you read out, that was a statement given to the press by Russell McAbery claiming that the councillors had given a wonderful testimony about their congregation, which is entirely false. You can listen to the–we're going to play you the recordings. You can listen to the councillors; they do not give a wonderful testimony about the Brethren congregation. So that's the context of that quote.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=397s)

Okay, I have a thought about using everyone, like each locality, using their own gospel name. It makes it seem more individualized and not a universal... It seems like each... So the Chicago people are on their own little island and they're called the Fourth Avenue Gospel. Over here they're called something like, so now they're no longer this universal Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. It's just a way to spread the blame.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=423s)

Yeah, and it's a way to not make them look like there's this one leader, one church. Now we've got hundreds of churches because they're all different names by their gospel hall trusts.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=435s)

It also helps their fiction that their rooms are just used for the local numbers. So you know, it makes them look like a small church and people see it and they don't anticipate that, yeah, they're going to cram 3,000 people in here and have a massive circus tent and be serving $100,000 worth of alcohol. It just looks like your little local church. It's a clever, clever strategy, but it's going to backfire every time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=465s)

And while you're watching these videos I want you to see if, so one of their claims they made was that these attacks from the outside were coming from ex-members versus the community. And I want to reiterate to the PBCC, not the Fourth Avenue Gospel trust, but to the PBCC, that we only got involved in meeting, was it meeting two? Meeting two we got involved, and no there had [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=495s)...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=495s)

There had been a lot more meetings before this, exactly. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, there had been a lot of stuff going on that even the residents weren't aware of because that's what one of the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=507s)

That's right.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=507s)

One woman, remember when she was after, she said why she was canceling the sale, she goes through it how you weren't here for this, you weren't here for this, and all these different meetings that took place. The audience, the chairs were empty and it sounded like from 2020 or something like that. Like it just went on for a long time without the residents even realizing that this was happening.

And then this one woman on the commissioner's board, the park district board, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=537s) saying that you guys weren't here, where were you? They didn't know. Yeah, they didn't know that this was happening. So they're also using that against the residents of, "Why weren't you here when we were still in the planning processes of this?" Well, the residents as far as I know didn't know. So that's also something to think about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=559s)

Okay, so our first speaker here is an actual Barrington resident speaking.

### [**Barrington resident 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=566s)

“I want to start tonight by thanking the commissioners in motion to vote on canceling the area and sales contract. I know the issue has intensified over the last few weeks and even requesting the vote is a courageous step on the part of this board. I'm not sure what motivated each of you to join the Park District Board, maybe to provide community service, improve certain park facilities, but I'm guessing it was not to have universal animosity directly towards you from your own neighbors.

I'm one of those neighbors who has not been thrilled with the events surrounding Area N over the last couple months. I moved to South Barrington five years ago. I live on Acadia Drive, ten houses away from the entrance to area. I appreciate Noel’s comments tonight and those of the PBCC and I believe fully in religious freedom and I'm not asking for anyone to discriminate tonight.

I sent my own kids to Noah's Ark preschool at the United Methodist Church. I go to Willow Creek's carnival with them every year. They attended the Park District [summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=631s) camp this summer, and they learned how to swim just down the hall. We love the community, we love our neighbors, and we plan to be here for life. But I'm not just any resident, I'm also one of the nine plaintiffs litigating against you, apparently with baseless claims.

And we're not just nine random opposition members in the community. Our legal bills are publicly funded by 65 other neighbors and they're part of more than 350 neighbors that signed a petition requesting each of you to vote to cancel the sales contract tonight. These neighbors, importantly, are from all across South Barrington, [representing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=679s) more than 30 different subdivisions within the community.

I'm speaking to you tonight, neighbor to neighbor, against our lawyer's advice. I'm making a decision to do what I felt was best for our community because I'm asking you to make a very difficult choice and do the same thing by canceling the sale with a unanimous vote.

The actions of the last 18 months were intended to get some much needed revenue for the park district. The vote to cancel tonight is prudent because the park district avoids the expenses of certain litigation with the community it serves. It also recognizes the renewed viability of residential development on the land, which is likely to bring both higher sales revenue and an ongoing stream of tax revenue to the district. This board will not be discriminating against a buyer. It will simply be following the precedent you established back in 2020 when you rejected a previous bid on Area N in pursuit of a higher sales price.

I think most importantly is beyond the tactical reasons for a vote to cancel the sale. The reality is a vote to cancel tonight does something immeasurably beneficial. It puts nearly the entire community behind you. If you want to pursue a future tax increase, we have marketing experts who can help you explain to residents what the benefits would be. We will campaign for it. If there's a new buyer of Area N, we have community [organizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=798s) that can get everyone to show up at plan commission meetings and advocate for those plans to bring you ongoing tax revenue.

If you want to start fundraising galas, we have event planners that would much rather work with you on that than on continued opposition rallies. If you need corporate sponsorship like some of the other local park districts have, many of us work for some of the biggest employers in the area. The list of possibilities for collaboration and community [engagement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=829s) goes on and on.

When I look back on the last eight weeks, what I'm most impressed by is the power of our community. It was not always demonstrated or deployed perfectly, but we're all now more aware of local politics than we were two months ago and we're motivated to bring positive change to our parks and to our village. We want to work with you to deploy that newfound power within the community and propel the park district forward in the months [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=859s) years ahead.

It begins tonight. It starts with the four of you. On behalf of a lot of the people in this room and many others who could not be here tonight, I ask that you each vote in favor of canceling the sale despite any concerns of future litigation. These residents fund the park district through our taxes. We will be the one shouldering any future burden. In taking this vote, you vote for the future of South Barrington, the power of your community and your constituents, and we move forward together as one.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=897s)

So here's our next video. This is another South Barrington resident pleading his case. Again, so far we've not seen any signs of religious bigotry.

### [**Barrington resident 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=908s)

“I don't think any of you folks on the Park District office would get to the point that it's gotten. I mentioned at the last meeting that this was so avoidable. I've been in your shoes in a higher elected office that I held for many years in Massachusetts, far more difficult issues, eminent domain, major zoning changes, significant issues affecting our tax base. But you know how you deal with those? Proactively, by speaking to your neighbors, having public hearings, and being fully transparent in your process.

I voted for that ballot initiative. I'm pretty familiar with ballot initiatives. I put many on the ballot myself. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=959s) you had to make sure that you maintain the right proper language when you do it. And I found that when I went back and looked at it, it was deceptive in terms of what actually had transpired and what was in that ballot initiative. I think you all know that.

So I also spent time when I moved here, I have been here three years, attending a couple of meetings in the village board on the comprehensive plan. This proposal does not meet the requirements set forth that the town of the village spent numerous dollars in developing in terms of the proper use of that land, and you all know that. There will be no tax dollars generated from this development, none. So, this ends up in the lap of the Planning and Zoning Commission and then the four Trustees. The question will be, why did you spend so much time on a comprehensive plan that you're not following?

But I think it all could have been avoided. And I understand that the Park District, like every other municipal agency, when you look at your tax bill, even District 220, you're strapped for funds. We keep seeing tax dollars, levies going up, and tax increases. But if you speak to your neighbors and your residents, you'll find that they'll be receptive to that, whether or not you have to issue bonds or you increase your tax levy, you would be supported by your neighbors. So I'm asking you, please do the right thing. Do the right thing [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1070s) your neighbors, for your residents, and for the taxpayers of South Barrington. Thank you.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1079s)

So I mean, that just speaks for itself and we're not hiding anything from you. These were the two resident speeches. This is all that the residents had to say at this meeting. And can you imagine any more decent, reasonable, democratic, helpful people than those two residents? There was nothing whatever that you could characterize as religious bigotry. They expressed their concern, they expressed their appreciation and support for the [council,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1109s) they put out perfectly good, sound reasons why they didn't want the sale to go ahead. And they did it in a very polite and respectful manner.

And this meeting and these speeches were characterized publicly in the press by the PBCC, by Russell McAbery, PBCC spokesman, as shameful and religious bigotry. [Now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1139s) of course, what Russell was counting on is that no one would have recorded what actually happened at the meeting. So they thought they could tell this lie, this horrible defamatory lie against the Barrington residents and get away with it because no one would know any different.

But thank you very much, Lynette, for being there and taking the recording and redeeming the reputation of all the residents of Barrington and proving that there was no religious bigotry, there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1169s) nothing shameful about this at all. This was simply a really shining example of democracy in action in a free country like the USA.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1180s)

I have that definition of religious bigotry and I'm going to read it out. 

“The fact of having and expressing strong unreasonable beliefs and disliking other people who have different beliefs or a different way of life.”

Now, how many ex-members can stand here and vote to be the recipients of that from the PBCC? Like, it was such a hypocritical moment when we read that. And I'm like, what are you, like, are you calling out yourself? Like, that's what it seems like to me, that this would be you calling out yourself. You are the biggest example of religious discrimination, religious bigotry. All those things that they sit there and blame everybody else on, they are, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1228s) you could look up in a dictionary of the definition of them, number one would be \#PBCC.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1234s)

Right? Absolutely. I mean, religious bigotry is where you have zero tolerance for anyone else's religion or anyone else's worldview. Theology. Yeah, theology. And who is more extreme in that respect than the Brethren? Where if your own son was to say, instead of attending the Brethren Church, was to attend a Baptist church [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1264s) a Presbyterian church, whose theology only differs from the Brethren theology in some technical details, they would cut their son off. They would regard them as dead. They would ban them from the house. They would tear up their photographs. They would pretend they didn't exist, and they would write them out of their will.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1285s)

They would tell them that they're better off dead than leaving. Yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1289s)

You can't get more religiously bigoted than that. That is the most extreme case. And there are thousands and thousands and thousands of examples of that happening right now all over the globe done by the Plymouth Brethren religious bigot Christian church. For them to call out these decent democratic US residents and citizens and call them religious bigots, it's such an eye-watering hypocrisy. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1320s) mean, we're running out of words here. The English language is not adequate. It just has this one word hypocrisy.

It doesn't meet the case. We need a new word like super-hyper-hypocrisy because this is the most extreme case you can possibly imagine of someone. I mean, the only example I could think of is like the Ku Klux Klan coming along, pointing the finger at someone and calling them racist.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1347s)

What trumps everything for the brethren, I think, is that they're sovereignly placed. Yeah. Okay. They've been born into the holy fellowship of God's son and we cannot, like that needs to be like accentuated or whatever the right word is. Like these people are so entitled.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1371s)

Yeah. That's the word, entitled.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1373s)

Entitled. Yeah, like they think that because they are sovereignly placed and sovereignly born into this holy fellowship of God's son, anything they say, anything they do, anything that happens, they are above, they are literally above reproach. Okay, so nothing can happen to them because of where they were born and how they were born into this cult.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1403s)

It struck me listening to it afterwards, this religious bigotry accusation, that this is very like, to give you a metaphor for it, it's very like the guy who thinks he's God's gift to women. You know, we all knew the guy at school who just had the fantastic hair and the sporting record and thought he was just the greatest thing. And he sets his heart on some pretty girl. And so he makes his [approach,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1433s) he makes his proposition to this girl. But the girl has actually been speaking to some of this guy's exes.

And so when he comes up to this girl, the girl tells him, "Look, I don't like your style. You know, clear off." Then the guy who's been saying how wonderful this girl is turns around and says, "Oh, you're a slut and you're a whore and you're ugly," because he's been rejected. And because he's a narcissist and he cannot take rejection, he immediately turns around and starts [shaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1464s) and defaming the very person that he had been trying to seduce.

And this is exactly what's happened here. Because if you look at that first meeting where the brethren make their case, you get this cringy moment when Steve says, "We are longing," and these are his words, "we are longing to be your neighbors." I mean, you know, he's sitting up in bed at night just thinking about all these lovely Barrington residents and how he would love to be next door to [them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1494s) And damn it, when they quite politely say, "Thanks, but no thanks," "I want to be your neighbor," "You are religious bigots. It's shameful what you're doing."

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1505s)

I mean, but you know, the reason that they like Barrington is because it's really hard, like the neighbors are so spread out, the houses and lots are so large. Yeah, it's pretty much just the wave. So you're pretty safe to say you cannot wait to be your neighbor when all you have to do is wave at them. You know, they're not, they're large lots out there. It's a nice place.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1531s)

Just let the hedge go another couple of feet, then you don't even have to wave.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1534s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1535s)

Okay, so what I want to do, we're going to bring up the PBCC lawyer's speech and of course, we can't show everything, it's like hours of video, so we've just clipped here and there of things, but this is the lawyer's.

### [**PBCC’s Lawyer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1550s) 

“It's just disheartening to hear that one commissioner has already been chased out of her seat and I do appreciate what you guys do. I know they pay you the big bucks to be here and so I just appreciate that you guys are representing the community in that basis. I rise tonight to speak on behalf of Fourth Avenue because, frankly, my church, when I was a small boy, went through something very similar. We actually had to go all the way to the Court of Appeals in Illinois [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1580s) deal with the same type of slander and the pressure that has already chased one board member away.

This is not an infrequent occurrence. This is the United States of America. Unfortunately, religious organizations face discrimination in real estate transactions and zoning. It's enough to make a law practice out of it, and not the type of law practice that anybody would go after. But I want to bring it to your attention because I've both passed statutes that protect religious organizations from discrimination in the real estate and zoning areas. And they gave us those rights because it's not infrequent for this type of behavior to occur.

The park district went through, dotted all the I's and crossed all the T's. We were about to close and we found out that there was a lawsuit that was filed. I got the opportunity to meet the park district's attorney in court, Mr. Puma, and it was clear that what we needed to do is let's see what's in this lawsuit before we go forward. Well, it turns out the lawsuit's baseless and that's [what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1648s) going to be discovered on October 11th when the court will consider the neighbors' lawsuits, those in opposition, the lawsuit that was filed.

My position on it is that Fourth Avenue Gospel should not be discriminated against in the real estate transaction because of misperceptions about who they are, what they stand for, because of who they decided to sell a piece of property to. The only way to stop that type of pressure is to stand up to it because the more people cave to these unlawful efforts, the more people will be emboldened to use them. And I see it all the [time,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1688s) attorneys file baseless lawsuits in order to bring proper purposes.

We now know that with the motion being filed, Mr. Puma's reviewed it, I've reviewed it, it's without merit. It's going to be denied on the 11th and we don't think that any vote should be taken in any event until October 11th when the court will deny the motion. Again, I think that frankly a lot of my script changed tonight after hearing that resignation. That's just truly despicable and it's something that communities shouldn't support, nor should the representatives of the community who understood the referendum process.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1733s)

So again, this is exactly the same accusation, just put in slightly more polite terms. He's claiming that the whole community opposition is down to religious discrimination, and it's very, very clear that it's nothing to do with religious discrimination. It's because the Brethren came in, they want to fence off the entire site, deny any public use of it. The church will not serve the area because residents will not be allowed to attend. And they're putting a massive store with a full-scale loading dock, a distribution center for groceries on the site. And that's not what the residents want.

And the lawyer is furthermore claiming that one of the commissioners had resigned because of the pressure. Now, the real reason the commissioner resigned is because we [pointed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1792s) out that there was a huge conflict of interest in the sense that the two commissioners who were pushing the thing were both realtors, and they stood to benefit enormously from 65 brethren households moving into the Barrington area and purchasing houses, which is a perfectly reasonable point to make. And rather than face being questioned about that in discovery, one of the two [councillors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1822s) concerned resigned just before the meeting, and the other one voted against his own idea and voted not to proceed with the sale.

This lawyer is an extremely expensive and high-powered lawyer, and what he specializes in is cases of religious discrimination against Christian organizations. It has nothing to do with property or planning. He's all about religious discrimination. And most of his cases are like, you know, where church schools [kick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1854s) out a teacher because they discover he's gay. He's actually part of a wider organisation which has been classified as a hate organisation. It's an organisation to which Gerald Chipeur belongs.

So this lawyer, along with Gerald Chipeur, who's the Brethren lawyer who's been pursuing me in Canada and has also been pursuing other ex-Brethren and caused a number of [websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1885s) to close down, they're members of an international organization called Alliance Defending Freedom, which has been classified as a homophobic hate organization. And it's basically an alliance of lawyers and far-right-wing politicians that work constantly behind the scenes to try and promote homophobic politics and a homophobic [agenda,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1915s) and they basically provide free legal services to anyone who's been put into court for hate speech if it relates to anything relating to homophobia.

So, this guy is not just a lawyer to push a planning issue. He's coming at this in a very high-powered way. If he had had the opportunity, he would have come at this in a very high-powered way, claiming that the PBCC, or Fourth Avenue as they now seem to be called, were being discriminated against by religious bigotry. And because he's saying, what he's appealing for is there shouldn't be a vote [taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1961s) tonight because he could see they could see the whole thing slipping out of their grasp. He didn't want the vote taken, but of course, fortunately the vote was taken.

So in fact, the case he's talking about that would come up on the 11th never came up because the whole sale was cancelled. But you can see what the PBCC's policy was, what their strategy was, was to turn this into a major expensive court case and claim religious bigotry [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1992s) religious discrimination as being the reason that they were being, you know, pushed off this site.

### [**PBCC member Dale Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=1999s)

“Mr. Chairman and members of the board, thank you for the opportunity to appear here this evening. My name is Dale Diener and I'm a member of the Fourth Avenue Gospel. We are a religious charity group owned and operated by a local congregation of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Tonight I want to reaffirm our commitment to purchase the Area N parcel of the South Barrington Park District and turn it from an overgrown, underutilized parcel into a beautiful space this community can be proud of.

[As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2029s) you know, our proposal is to develop a new place of worship and a school for our 200 church members and their families. We have lived and worked and worshipped in the Chicagoland area since the 1860s. Through our business relationships and our community service activities, we have many customers, friends, and business partners in the area. We enjoy wonderful relationships with our community leaders and residents from all around the region.

Our church has served and supported every community we've been part of, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2059s) has been confirmed in letters by the mayor of Northlake and other community leaders. Our church members are dedicated to the communities in which we live, and we are proud of our work in relief of local citizens who have faced adversity through fires, floods, and tragic events like the Highland Park shooting. We have made no secret of our plans to use this site for our church and to build a state-of-the-art school for our families.

We have taken care to ensure that we preserve the wetlands and limit environmental impact. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2089s) have made changes to the design to accommodate requests from locals to minimize traffic and maximize green space. Our $1.725 million bid is fair and above market value. Several previous developers and home builders have looked at the property and offered less money, but they have all walked away because they couldn't make their plans work. The community will also benefit.

The property sale is above market value, will bring cash into the parks district, and while as a not-for-profit entity, the church, like the park district, will not be subject to property taxes. The continued operation of the school and the church will support local businesses and local suppliers. This project and our church have been derided by a few anti-church activists who have, some of whom have not set foot in South Barrington, with false and hateful information and lies. We have published a website, “[thetruthaboutarean.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20231002002931/https://thetruthaboutarean.com/)”, to expose these falsenesses and [provide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2150s) the true facts about our intentions and about our church and about the development.

The vitriol and the ignorant hatred being spread about us is hurtful to our families. Moreover, it borders on an attack on our constitutional religious freedom to congregate and worship. But this discussion today is not about the church or even about the project. It is about the sale of the property. We have been and will continue to address all community concerns and ideas about the property when we go through the planning approval with the [village](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2180s) of South Barrington. We remain committed to this project and we know these attacks on our rights are not representative of the entire South Barrington community. Thank you very much. Thank you.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2193s)

I think the most striking thing about this speech as compared to the speech by the Barrington residents is the Barrington residents' speeches were both met by very loud and extended applause. The speeches by the PBCC lawyer and Dale Diener were met with complete silence. And what that tells me is that every single person in that hall was against the plan. They didn't want the sale to go ahead.

Now, [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2224s) their publicity and their website, the brethren claim that a tiny fraction or a small but vocal minority of Barrington residents are opposed to the hall. So where, please, is the majority that actually wants this to go ahead? Not one of them bothered to turn up to the meeting or you'd have heard them applauding at the end of Dale's speech. The fact is that no one, none of the Barrington residents actually want this thing [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2254s)

As for the rest of what Dale says, as he said, they launched a website and, you know, once we finish with the meeting, we're going to go through that website point by point and take it apart. But clearly, this is not just a small minority of Barrington residents. There's no one bothered to come to the meeting to support the Brethren's plan.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2281s)

His speech was the most narcissistic, gaslighting, hypocritical speech ever given. For them to sit back and complain that, oh, how their families were impacted by the attack. The rest of us feel sitting out here, like, are you kidding me? I was pushed out because of what happened to me and it was needed to be covered up. It's such a typical PBCC behavior when they're dealing with someone that doesn't know about the PBCC.

Which we were so grateful, Lynette, that you were able to step up and actually inform these people of who this group really is versus what they put forward. And we are going to [share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2328s) some screenshots of another PBCC Chicago lady who got on another app and literally was to say that they were going to have an open house. Like, they were lying through their teeth over what they were going to do if they could win this case.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2343s)

And I mean, to talk about the impact to their families, what impact does the PBCC have on families? Exactly. They split up families everywhere. At least, Dale Diener, you have your family. Your PBCC has deprived us of our families.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2359s)

Yeah, you want to talk about religious discrimination.

That's why it was so good that it was Lynette sitting in Chicago and not me, because after that meeting, I would have not walked away. I wouldn't have walked away. And it's a good thing I'm poor and I don't have a private jet plane.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2380s)

So what we have to touch on here is that these people in Barrington or anywhere that are dealing with brethren or Fourth Avenue Gospel or whatever they're talking about themselves these days, they're not banking on an ex-brethren member. Like, there cannot be an ex-brethren member everywhere that there's some opposition going on, right? So since I was there, I was able to [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2410s) the people in Barrington don't know who and what they're dealing with.

Until someone, that's why they get their own way so often, I think, is because you don't know what you don't know, right? So if someone's telling you a beautiful story and what they're planning on doing and all this other stuff, and thankfully the residents did start digging, but I'm sure this happens in a lot of other localities where the residents don't dig. And then before you know, there's this massive meeting room in a residential area and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2453s) like, so what I'm getting at is that the people that don't have a voice of an ex-member to tell them, "You guys, that's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie," like that's not true, how do they know that it's a lie? They don't.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2474s)

So that's exactly, you don't expect a Christian church to be lying to you. I mean if it was like an industrial corporation or a fish processing factory, you might expect them to be a bit devious and lie to you. You don't expect good, shiny Christians that serve burgers with red tents to come and just do the most egregious, blatant lies to get their own way. So yeah, they just absolutely gaslight everyone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2504s)

To the shooting there, RRT, like they, that RRT would not be there. They would not be going to any Highland shooting disaster catastrophe if they hadn't had to develop RRT. The only reason they go to these places and publicize it everywhere is to keep their charity status and all those pictures and documents of it is proof of them doing their charity work.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2528s)

Yes, and most charities don't need to take selfies. I was part of a, it was called Area N News Channel. So it was like this, it was updated often from the residents. So I was part of this resident like a group text thing. And I mean, there was never anything, not once was there anything that was religious bigotry, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2559s) once was there anything that was, "We don't want these people because of their beliefs." It was nothing like that.

During the actual, that last park district meeting that we were, we haven't got to Pete yet, maybe I'm jumping the gun here, but when Pete was talking, I mean he was lying, okay? And a few different residents started to get a little bit loud and a text came through from the main facilitator of the group. She writes, "Regardless of the outcome of this vote, if you're in this room, please try to remain calm." Wow. So if anything, this group of residents was the epitome of politeness and kindness and wanting to listen and trying to understand.

But also wanting, what people have to also remember is that this meeting room, proposed meeting room, is in a residential area. It's not over with other factories. It's in people's backyards. That is the reason [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2656s) were upset. It's in their neighborhood. It's not anything to do with religious bigotry. It was, "We don't want semis coming down our streets where our kids play. We don't want extra cars every few weeks." It has nothing to do with what they're trying to portray.

And like that's what I'm saying, if ex-brethren weren't there or if we're not like what [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2686s) doing today, like residents just don't know what they're dealing with in any town that they come into. Like they don't know. And so that's why it's good that you guys are doing what you do.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2698s)

And it's equally why the brethren are so outraged, because they've relied on this gaslighting and lying procedure for so long and suddenly, thanks to the internet and thanks to ex-brethren Facebook pages and ex-brethren groups, suddenly they're finding it doesn't work anymore because people can find the truth for themselves.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2719s)

And we'll go through the letter that the mayor gave and debunk that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2726s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2726s)

What about  Pete's video?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2727s)

So Pete is the president of the council and so he was the one primarily responsible for pushing the brethren's agenda.

### [**Pete Perisin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2742s)

“I appreciate that. It really, it's irrelevant to us. It's the voters didn't vote. I can't help you. But the voters went and the voters voted us in and they voted for us to sell. After that, it's kind of too late. The time was when we voted. So I appreciate the petition, you know, if they're right or wrong, I don't know, but it's irrelevant to us because you needed to vote. If you didn't vote, that's not our fault.

The park district is just a seller. We're just a seller, that's all we are. We're not engaged in it, we're not part of it, it's nothing. If there's a buyer, we sell it to the buyer who came in at the highest price, who was responsible. Responsible meaning they have all the funds to go through this. They did that. Even though we didn't need to really do any kind of checking up on them, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2803s) know, we did enough where we talked to the village of Northlake.

And I have it here too, and the mayor, just to ask about what they were like as neighbors, what are they like as neighbors? And the mayor, glowing recognition. Police chief, never had any issue. The township never had any issues. So then obviously none of the neighbors had any issues, otherwise all those people would know a lot. So about them being bad or a cult and all that stuff, I don't know. They've been in Northlake for 40 years and the mayor [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2838s) give them a higher recommendation.

So I think a lot of that gets thrown out. There was some YouTube thing about some guy hiding in Canada. I looked up him. This is all online. He's apparently a criminal, so he's hiding out. And a lot of the emails and the websites that I'm seeing from you guys, from the protesters, believe this guy more than they believe us or believe like the village, like the mayor of Northlake. And that's a little disheartening to me that some guy in a YouTube video sitting in his truck in the middle of Canada because he can't go back to his homeland because he basically sentenced to serve 18 months in prison. And it's all public to find it.

That disturbed me a little bit. And we got killed with that they were going to serve liquor. And somehow this guy said something about serving liquor. Well, it took me eight seconds to Google that and you can't within a hundred feet of a school or a church, you can't sell liquor. You can't get a liquor license. And every board meeting I was at at the building hall, it was never brought up once. But all of a sudden that's something that I got all these emails screaming at us about that they're going to sell, that they're selling liquor at this, that they're going to get a [liquor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2914s) license.

I don't know where that came from. So just throw that out too. It's all this stuff that wasn't needed to be part of it, but we're trying to have good dialogue and that's what bothered a lot of us. And then we're getting the emails to follow up with those. And if you don't think these are threatening emails, then you should come read them because they are, personally, professionally. I mean, it's, I'm not even gonna go through, I highlighted a bunch of them, but I'm really not going to go through [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2944s) because I just don't want people to do it.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2947s)

You know, I want to just touch on what he said that, oh, he was, it was disheartening because they were believing us more than the mayor. Well, I can guarantee you they're very smart. They shouldn't be believing the mayor and they shouldn't be believing the police. You're not going to find police reports because you're not allowed to report anything. And I guarantee that mayor had something in his back pocket. And Pete, if you don't believe us, come live in our lives for a little bit and you'll really quick catch up to how the PBCC [handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=2978s) themselves.

Go to [openandcandid.com](http://openandcandid.com) and read through that website and you will find very fast how the PBCC work with government officials. It was very smart of the residents to take what we had to say and believe it. And on that note, let's jump into the whole alcohol thing. Okay, so if they can't get a liquor license there, that's not going to stop them. They'll serve it. And then they'll charge them in their own little way.

[When](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3008s) they have an event, we just had this happen in Palmerston North in New Zealand. What they do in one locality, what they do in one gospel trust, they do with all of them, regardless whether you need a liquor license or not. We have proof of the alcohol that was served in Palmerston North under tents in New Zealand, which they are then now compensating back their money to be able to pay for that. And those people were charged for that alcohol that was served there. [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3038s)...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3038s)

On the meeting room grounds.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3040s)

On the meeting room grounds. So it doesn't matter if the Campus\&Co isn't going to have a liquor store in there. As soon as that law changes in the states, I guarantee you they will have a liquor store in there. So as much as you want to believe, Pete, that what we are saying is a bunch of bull, it's not. We have the proof. We've lived it. We've experienced it. You haven't. You have not been there. You're being gaslit and lied to just like everybody else is. So it is [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3070s) that the residents trust us more than the police and the mayor.

They can go around and have any kind of politician, anybody in their back pocket, give them glowing reviews. But wouldn't you rather sit and talk to the people that have left and why they have left? This isn't just a handful of people. This is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds over how many hundreds of years that have left that are all saying the same thing. I never knew Richard before this. I had no clue who he [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3101s) right? I never met Carman until she had moved to Maple Creek and I really didn't even talk to her. So these are all of us coming together to really shred the lies that are being told. And as you sitting there as president of this park commission board, sitting there being disheartened...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3121s)

I can't see him getting re-elected very easily. I mean, he's just shredding the very people whose votes he needs to get in for his next term. And the other question is, if he is not getting any benefit out of this deal, why is he so upset about it? He's very upset. He's very agitated. He does really behave like someone who's just seen a few million dollars get slippery under his grasp. He shouldn't care. He's there to do whatever the residents want. If the residents don't want this deal, if it doesn't make any difference to him personally in a financial sense, why is he so upset?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3164s)

About it? He should be neutral. He should be neutral. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3167s)

He's just a representative of the residents. He should be saying what they want. I mean, the other thing that was shocking is the way he dismissed their petition. They got a petition with 1,387 signatures on it. And he says, "Oh, it's irrelevant. It's irrelevant." Why is it irrelevant? I mean, he's going to find out how relevant that is when the next election comes.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3189s)

What an arrogant person.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3191s)

So arrogant. We also need to touch a little bit about this Northlake mayor. The meeting room isn't in Northlake. It's not, it's in, it's near Northlake, but Northlake, the meeting room is in unincorporated, it's in an unincorporated township that's just not Northlake.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3215s)

So they might as well get a recommendation from the mayor of Honolulu saying that the brethren had caused them no problem.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3222s)

Yeah. Lynette lives in Chicago and went to that meeting so she knows where it is. This isn't just few enough. This is Lynette logistically knowing that that is false information, that the Northlake mayor isn't neighbors to those brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3238s)

Yeah. I mean, the other thing is he's spouting off about some guy in his car in Canada. Now, the reason I was in my car was because I didn't have internet at that point because we'd just moved house. So I'd driven down to the local library because it was a bit of an emergency to get this podcast out. I'm not actually living in my car, if that's what you were trying to imply, Pete.

And the other thing is, why should they believe me rather than these other people? [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3268s) gave them the receipts. I gave them the link to the planning website where you can look at the plans, the official plans of the Bristol meeting room, which is the same size. And you can look at the plans. You can count the seats. You can see the capacity. It's not just me talking. I'm pointing you to the public resources where you can check all these facts for yourself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3292s)

So we have another video of Pete that will wrap up with his rants that he did. 

### [**Pete Perisin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3299s)

“If you didn't vote, that's not my fault.  But the same voters that put … in this past April also voted yes for the referendum to sell the property. So we decided, you know, we as a board said, "Okay, we got the referendum passed, the voters want us to sell." But we did it per the letter of the law, period. There were no side deals done with the church. All that stuff is all garbage. So all those things, throw all those out because that's all garbage. That's why poor Shelby Elias, you know, she [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3329s) I are in real estate, so I guess we must have done something bad with the church because they want to buy property. So I don't know how that happens, but that's what was coming back to us and then we lost.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3342s)

So if there's nothing dodgy here and there's no side deal and it's all above board and they've done everything they should, why don't they go ahead? Because the residents' case will be thrown out on the 11th because it's without merit. So they'd go ahead. But no, they don't. They're running. They're running. So it kind of tells you that they really don't want any digging in this area.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3367s)

We'll just let the viewers and listeners come to a conclusion on that last one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3374s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3375s)

Yeah, we'll let it speak for itself. Okay, so the next video that we're going to go to is somebody else who was on the parks commission board and I've only done a small clip of hers. But this lady really lit on fire and she was, the reason I just did a small clip of it is because she really bashes her neighbors and friends and she was really mad at the Barrington residents. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3406s) the clip I'm going to show you is the clip where she speaks about the PBCC.

### [**Barrington Commissioner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3408s)

“We are being asked to break a fair and just contract made with the church. In all of this, I cannot identify one valid complaint against the church. The allegations that the church is a cult is unfounded. I am from a religious minority and have witnessed the other side. I cannot morally be part of accusations against a practicing religious group. The church has not done anything illegal. The church and Park District have not done [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3439s) illegal. If we have, please call the FBI and the cops and report us. I cannot be privy to religious discrimination.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3447s)

So honey, it is a cult. And if I get your email, I'll send you a video I'm working on right now. You can catch up on all 74 podcasts in two hours and by the time you're done, you'll realize it is a cult. And what we are doing is not religious discrimination. What they did to us was religious discrimination. What they are doing to everybody else is religious discrimination. So, I will find your email [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3477s) I'd be happy to fill you in on all the holes. You may have gone through a lot of stuff through your own day-to-day life, but what we're dealing with the PBCC is completely different, absolutely different.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3493s)

The other thing is, and I don't know what religion this lady is, whether she's a Hindu or whether she's a Muslim, but she's definitely an ethnic minority. She looks like she comes from probably India. If you knew what the brethren thought about you, what they thought about Muslims and Hindus, what the brethren thought about people whose skins are not shiny white, you would not be sticking up for these people. They are the most racist and intolerant, and particularly against Muslims and particularly against people with a darker colored skin. They're not the nice people that you think they are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3539s)

As much as they try and make people think differently.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3541s)

If you're a woman and you're a Muslim and you've got dark colored skin...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3546s)

And you're in a position of power. Not good. So our next video is when they did the vote.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3559s)

So this is a vote as to whether to cancel the sale or not.

### [**Pete Perisin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3566s)

So the motion is to cancel the sales contract. Is the motion. So the motion is to cancel. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So the contract is cancelled.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3622s)

That was a very happy moment.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3623s)

That was a good moment, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3627s)

They didn't go out without a fight though.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3629s)

No, no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3630s)

They really put up a fight.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3632s)

A whole lot of sour grapes there. Yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3636s)

Yeah. No, there were some people that weren't laughing or smiling or clapping.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3641s)

Yeah. The extraordinary thing is, in spite of this complete defeat, and even Pete, who had pushed the plan all the way through, voting to cancel a sale, the brethren didn't just kind of walk away quietly. There was this whole load of vindictive sour grapes. They seem to have got hold of the, somehow got the ear of the journalist of the Chicago Herald.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3680s)

Daily Herald.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3682s)

Yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3684s)

The Daily Herald.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3685s)

The Daily Herald. And he's kind of been publishing articles more or less that they've dictated to him, lots of extensive quotes from PBCC spokesperson Russell McAbery. And rather than, you know, walking away from this, because it's obviously dead, and they've obviously got no chance of resurrecting this deal, they go out with a massive kind of vindictive attack against the residents of Barrington, and against the ex-Brethren community.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3716s)

So this is their website that they made up called The Truth About Area N. And of course, they only put the stuff on it that supports theirs. And so if you go on and browse this area, it's got Shelby Elias' resignation letter, their letter to South Barrington residents and the Northlake Mayor's letter of support. So we're actually going to, let's just pull this Mayor's letter of support up here. Very short and sweet.

"To whom it may concern, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has been part of the Northlake community for approximately 40 years and have been great neighbors and members of the community. Their church has presented little or minimal effect on traffic or disruption to the neighborhood and surrounding area. In fact, their activities are so low-key that you forget that they're even there. I'm sure that with well thought out landscaping and good design that their facility will blend into the neighborhood and soon become woven into the fabric of community as they were in Northlake. Jeffrey Sherwin, the mayor."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3777s)

So the reason he's forgotten they're even there is because they're not actually there. So they must have been remarkably low key.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3784s)

I mean, they're in the area, but they're not, the meeting room itself is not in Northlake. And they don't have any school or superstore. Yeah. Right. I wish I had back in the day when we would have fellowship meetings every three months, I wished I had a phone back then. The streets don't have sidewalks in, in the, in Leiden [Township,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3814s) it's called. They don't have sidewalks.

So the cars are just parked on like kind of on gravel parts of people's grass for like each side. And buses, buses are, they're idling on the streets. People are getting on and off. Like what part of this letter, if the brethren, they know that that letter is a lie. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3844s) just know it's a lie. And people walking, like people that are at the homes of the brethren, I mean most people have moved out now, they've moved further out west, but everyone walking, like groups of people walking with high heels and big scarves and there's no sidewalk, so you're walking in the street. Like yeah, there's no way that no one saw [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3875s) or didn't see them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3876s)

See them, yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3877s)

Yeah, it like, that letter is just so such a slap in the face to the residents in the area of the Leiden Township meeting room, really.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3891s)

Crazy. And then they wrote a letter to South Barrington residents. And so we're going to just go through this really quick.

 "September 25th. Dear friends and neighbors of South Barrington, We're writing to you from Fourth Avenue Gospel Building Inc., a registered 501c3 public religious charity established in 1972\. We are a group that entered into a contract to purchase the parcel of land known as Area N from the South Barrington Park District. Area N has remained [undeveloped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3922s) for 19 years and is now an overgrown scrub and brush. Fourth Avenue Gospel's $1.725 million bid for the property was the highest received in the recent public auction that has ever been received for this property."

 Let's stop here and go like, it was the only bid.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3937s)

Yeah, it was also the lowest bid, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3942s)

The highest and the lowest, yeah, the only. 

"We have put a lot of time and effort into carefully developing plans for the property. They're environmentally conscious, low density, and that will add substantial value to the South Barrington community." 

Again, completely and utterly false. There's no, you can't add that kind of value to the South Barrington community when it's just not.

"These plans will turn an undeveloped, unsightly lot into a beautiful site that includes a new place of worship and state-of-the-art school."

 I'm going to add here that [nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=3972s) outside of the PBCC can enter into. So again, it's not going to add any value to the South Barrington community. 

"Our group and this project have been subject to much false information. Many of these lies have been generated by agitators from outside the U.S. and who have no connection to South Barrington or the greater Chicago area."

Again, yeah, anybody who sits and listens to what we're saying know that what we're saying is not lies and that we are calling them out on their lies. 

"This website breaks down the myths being promoted by these outside activists and provides the points to dispute what they've been saying about the project. We welcome a fair and open dialogue about the merits of the project and the benefits it will bring to the community and this website provides our side of the story."

 Well, I have to say it, I reached out to Steve, Russell, I reached out to everybody, [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4023s) did their work emails for an open dialogue and I never heard back from anybody. Even put it on Facebook, because you know they watch us, nobody got back to me. So they do not welcome fair and open dialogue. They never have, never will.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4037s)

Yeah, we put a lot of effort into trying to invite them to come on the podcast and give their point of view. Zip, no response at all. So you know, let's have, we're going to have the fair and open dialogue.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4051s)

Yeah, you just don't.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4052s)

We'll go through what you have to say, Russell and Steve, and we'll add some comments.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4057s)

"Please visit the website to learn the truth about Area N. We would greatly value your feedback and support and have included our contact information below."

 Well, we are now getting your feedback. We're doing your feedback here. So we'll go into that rebuttal. So their very first one, 

"The opposition of Area N development is being led by local concerned citizens." They're saying that is a myth.

"Fact: The instigator of the attacks on the Area N project is Richard Marsh, who left [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4088s) PBCC years ago after he killed a mother of three in a car crash for which he was criminally charged. The courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar. He has been sentenced to prison in his home country, England, for his repeated contempt of court." 

And then they go in and try and give as much proof as they can. Again, I just want to pause before Richard jumps in here that we never came into this till just the last few meetings, right? So it has been led by the local concerned citizens up [until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4118s) this point when they started digging and realizing, "Hey, the PBCC isn't who they say they are." If you look at the letter that I read just previously, in that letter, if you go back and read it, the PBCC wasn't mentioned once. It was all Fourth Avenue Gospel, which is the PBCC. Okay, go ahead, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4140s)

Yeah, so our only involvement in this, my only involvement was I put together a short video, which just had a few key points. One is that when they say the maximum capacity of the meeting room is 1,000 persons, that's completely untrue. And I gave all the receipts, all the planning for similar rooms around the globe, that actually, this is a 2,000 capacity meeting room and if they fill up the foyer you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4170s) get nearly 3,000 in.

None of this is rebutted. Nowhere in this rebuttal do they come back and say, "Well, you know, no, it really is a 1,000 seat meeting room." So if you're going to accuse someone of being a liar and having lied about this project, then you have to call out the lies. You have to say, "Richard said this, the truth is this. Richard said this, the truth is this." The key point is that they had only given the capacity of the meeting room as 1,000, whereas in fact it's 2,000. Now they're not rebutting this because they can't, because they know perfectly well this is true. And there were a number of other points that I made and that I gave receipts for and that we will be going through.

We're going to address all the other points on here, these personal attacks on me about the accidents, the court cases. We're going to address that at the end of this podcast. But if they're going to call me a liar, then tell me what I've lied about. Tell me what statement I've made that's untrue.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4233s)

Okay, the next one is, 

"Myth: Lack of transparency. The Park District and the Village have been working with Fourth Avenue Gospel since January 2022, unbeknownst to the community. They've also misled people about how the sale would affect taxes."

 "Facts: Fourth Avenue Gospel has cooperated with local authorities at every step along the way and has been fully transparent in providing impact assessments and plans to locate a church, building, and school on the property. The connection between Fourth Avenue Gospel and the PBCC congregation was fully disclosed since the developer [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4264s) expressed interest in properties on public record as early as 2020\. The fact that the end user of the development is a not-for-profit tax-exempt entity was clearly stated on the record. All Village and Park District meeting records are public record. The Park District has acted within its authority and the developer remains committed to working with the community as demonstrated in its recent hearing and the developer's consideration of specific community concerns."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4289s)

Well, I mean, the reality is that they put around a referendum asking to sell this land and it stated on the referendum that by selling the land it would increase the tax revenues to the city so that they wouldn't have to do a tax hike for the residents. And of course, what they actually were selling to was an entity that would not be paying any property tax. So indeed, they did mislead people about how the sale would affect the taxes.

[Now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4319s) there is a kind of a half-truth here in that if you had been reading all the council minutes, if you had actually been along to attend the council meetings, you might have picked up Fourth Avenue Gospel Trust name at some point. But the residents had no idea what they were dealing with. Even if they'd picked it up, they would just assume it was a conventional church that they could attend, that was a place of public worship.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4348s)

And this goes back to what Lynette was saying earlier. I do agree with her on why they're really doing this change. Because had they said PBCC, people go in and Google PBCC. What comes up in our last year's worth of work? Yes. So I could see why they are now turning to using just the gospel names. Absolutely. Okay. Let's go to the next one.

"Myth: Selective advertising. The park district intentionally targeted residents least affected by the sale while neglecting to inform those who would be most impacted."

 And their fact is,

"Fourth Avenue Gospel has been informed by the Park District's legal council that all required notifications according to routine and pre-approved procedures were followed."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4393s)

That's a funny rebuttal, isn't it? Because they're not actually saying, "Yes, we did notify the nearby residents." They're just saying, "Well, we ticked all the boxes." And the fact is the nearby residents all said they never got the notification.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4407s)

Like people actually went to the post office to get the list and the residents that would have been affected by this did not get the flyer.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4416s)

Yeah, case closed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4418s)

Perfect, the perfect politician's way of answering something, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4422s)

Yes, it's a very devious answer, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4424s)

Exactly, it doesn't really answer it. The next one,

"Pre-arranged sale," that was their myth, "Pre-arranged sale" in quotations. 

"Facts: At no point was there any pre-arranged sale. The Park District informed Fourth Avenue Gospel that a public auction would be required for the sale whereby any potential buyers could be presented to place bids on the property. Fourth Avenue Gospel was the highest bidder and operated in full transparency throughout the process."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4451s)

This is comical because they arranged the auction, which the actual advertising for the auction was some like tiny little column of print in a newspaper that has a very high subscription cost.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4467s)

It was, yeah, it's the same newspaper, the Daily Herald.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4472s)

Yes. And then the only people that turn up is the Fourth Avenue Gospel Trust. They'd set the minimum bid at $1.75 million. Fourth Avenue bid that. Bang, the hammer goes down. Sale closed. And they still say they were the highest bidder. I mean, it's such a stupid assertion.

Now, I want to put an analogy in here because both the two people who were pushing this, which is Pete and Shelby Elias, the VP and the president of the Barrington Park District, they're both realtors. They both know perfectly well the value of advertising and the importance of advertising a property if you want to sell it. So let's take the analogy that you had a [$2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4519s) million house and you went along to these two realtors and you said, "Okay, I'm going to be out of the country. I want you to sell this house for me."

So when you get back a year later, you find they've sold the house for a very low sum. You're going to say to them, "Well, did you advertise it? Did you put photos on your website? Did you mail shot? Did you promote this thing?" And they say, "Oh, no, no, we didn't do any of that. We didn't take any photos. We just put it up for auction and we put an advert [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4549s) there was going to be an auction." I mean, it's so obvious that they did the absolutely bare legal minimum. And yet, technically, they have ticked the box in that they've done a public auction to sell the property. But they have done absolutely nothing to promote it. And it's just staringly obvious that it was prearranged. They arranged with the brethren that they'll have this auction, they will do the absolute minimum of publicity and, you know, hopefully you can come in, there won't be any competition.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4579s)

Okay, next one. 

"Myth: Pre-approval. The Park District walked the church through village pre-approval processes months before allowing the community to vote on the sale."

"Facts: Fourth Avenue Gospel expressed interest in multiple properties throughout the area and conducted typical due diligence on this property. The current zoning classification for this property allows for church and school use."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4602s)

So again, this is a sort of classic answer that doesn't answer the question. They're not saying it wasn't pre-approved. They're just saying they expressed interest in multiple properties. So what? It's not even relevant to the point you're making. So it's just some waffle to kind of cover up the fact that they had been working very closely with the park district on this.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4626s)

But notice what they say here. "The current zoning classification for the property allows for church." It allows for a public, public and public school. Exactly. It doesn't allow for private church and private school. That's what, like this is where they are still having so much pushback against us. They're just denying the fact that the LUDs or the PUDs or what they were called, something Sage called them, it's in the zoning, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4657s) the zoning paperwork. Yeah, there is an allowance for that, but it's for a public church and a public school, not the brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4668s)

They would need rezoning.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4670s)

Yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4670s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4671s)

Okay, the next one. 

"Myth: Values and future use. The church's proposed use includes an elementary school building that contains a liquor store, conflicting with South Barrington's community values."

"Facts: This is a lie. The development includes plans for a school store operated by the church. There will be absolutely no alcoholic products sold on the property. The project is led by local developers who have served the community for decades. To suggest that these upstanding community members would [undermine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4701s) community values is absurd."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4705s)

All the upstanding community members…\!

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4710s)

Well, the meeting hall itself has a back room. So if the Man of God comes in, it's stocked with alcohol, right? Like, alcohol is going to be on the premise.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4721s)

Okay. So they've now admitted it's a Campus\&Co store when in their initial planning application, they called it a gift shop or a school store. It's not a school store. It's a full supermarket. They sell food, groceries, clothes, home accessories, toilet paper, everything that your Walmart would sell. Not such a wide range, but they sell the full range of goods.

And just go on Google, put in Campus\&Co and alcohol, and this is what pops up. 

“Alcohol, Campus\&Co, alcohol, beer, spirits, the Coors, wines, Campus\&Co, Northampton, alcohol, whiskey and bourbon, brandy and cognac, gin, rum, vodka, mixers, liqueurs.” 

And I had a look at Campus\&Co Northampton, and they've got no less than 200 different kinds of alcohol for sale at their [Campus\&Co](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4779s) store.

Now, fair enough, the brethren in Chicago might not be able to get a liquor license for that location, given that that's the local residents' laws. But it was perfectly reasonable of us to raise the question as to whether they would be selling alcohol from their Campus\&Co store, because that's what they're doing. It's being rolled out all around the globe in a huge way, selling alcohol from their Campus\&Co stores. And in any case, even if they're [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4811s) selling it from that store because they can't get a license, they will still be serving huge quantities of alcohol at the meeting hall on the same site every time they have a fellowship meeting.

So yeah, so here's a Campus\&Co and notice it says "Your Superstore." Now they've got a very nasty attack saying Richard Marsh is lying by saying it's going to be a superstore. Campus\&Co is a superstore and here's their website to prove it. So [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4841s) this is just the first four out of 200 different lines of alcohol that they sell in Campus\&Co stores.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4848s)

Okay, so the next one is, 

"Myth: Sanctity of park space. Area N has been a public park for 21 years, benefiting everyone. The proposed sale turns it into a private asset that serves no local resident."

"Facts: Area N is a complete overgrown area of land owned by the park district not currently used as a public park. The community expressed its desire to develop Area N when it previously voted to approve a sale in the local referendum. This development will clean up this eyesore and completely complement the local community. No one claimed Area [N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4879s) was benefiting the community until Fourth Avenue Gospel proposed to put in a church on the site at which point anti-church activists came forward."

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4886s)

That's not true. Like the whole time, when I would make posts on the Barrington Facebook page, I would have residents come at me in full force and saying, "We are not touching this, the Freedom of Religion act." Like no one is against a church. No one. Like it was very vocal when I would try to post stuff. I would have these [residents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4916s) telling me, "This is not for this page because we are not against churches." So for them to say this, "at which point anti-church activists came forward," no. There was, maybe people came forward because of their neighborhood being altered and the simple fact that a private church and a private school and they can't bring their kids there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4944s)

Even with ex-members, I mean, you're not, Lynette, you're not anti-church. Carman's not anti-church. I'm not anti-church. Richard isn't anti-church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4951s)

None of us are, no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4952s)

I'm anti-cult, right? I'm anti-cult. But I would love, I would love the PBCC to become a church. I would love for it to become a church. That would be like the biggest transformation they could do is make it a church and we could all...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4971s)

Retire.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4972s)

Take away the separation…

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4972s)

The separation issue. Yes, exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=4976s)

I mean the other thing here is that Area N is not completely overgrown. If you go on Google satellite view, it's got like hedges and trees all around the perimeter and a great big area of open grassland in the middle. I mean it would make a very nice public space or wildlife reserve or, you know, nature park.

And the point that the brethren have been very, very careful to conceal is that all their meeting room sites are completely security fenced with heavy duty security gates, cameras and floodlights. The whole area would be denied any public use at all. Whereas if it was a conventional public church, you know, the nice ones with a spire, generally speaking, the public's allowed to use the ground. You can walk your dog there or you can have a picnic [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5033s).

And they'll be holding like church events. They'll have Thanksgiving meals to which everyone's invited. A church is normally a public facility and also churches get used extensively for non-religious functions like often they will have an evening meetup club for lonely people or a women's knitting circle or even book clubs, games night or a book club. They're a public facility that's available to be used to help the residents. [None](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5064s) of this would happen with the Brethren.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5065s)

To like, to feed the homeless on certain nights of the month. Like yeah, none of that, none of that would be happening.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5075s)

Okay, the next myth.

 "The Park District purchased Area N 20 years ago for $3 million. The fact that they're now accepting $1.7 million is a huge loss for the community, suggests that they gave Fourth Avenue Gospel some sort of a sweetheart deal." 

"Facts: The original purchase of $3 million for the property was paid above market value to settle a legal dispute with the developer of the Woods community. Since then, multiple developers have backed out of developing the property. Fourth Avenue Gospel presented the best legitimate offer in 20 years and was selected by the [Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5105s) District in an open and transparent process. Fourth Avenue's Gospel plan will bring in far less traffic and disruption than the tract housing that had previously been planned for the site, plans that the community did not object to. The present opposition is thus based on anti-religious bias, not on the merits of Fourth Avenue Gospel's high value, low impact offer."

 I mean, you just can't sit here and read them without laughing.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5129s)

Can you?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5130s)

I mean look at the videos we've got and the pictures we've got of things like the massive fellowship meetings with the huge circus tents outside the front, the coaches lined up down the road and people in high-vis jackets trying to direct the traffic while the local residents are driving past. 

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5151s)

Far less traffic and disruption.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5159s)

 I mean, if they put say, 20 houses on there, the volume of traffic is going to be spread over the whole day. And so, in terms of the total number of car movements per year, it might not be much different. I suspect it would be a whole lot less than the Brethren. But the point is, the Brethren, they all arrive at the same time. So you've got these 65 households, then you've got the interchange, they're all arriving, they're all leaving at the same time, and then you've got their school traffic and their shop [traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5189s) and their semi-trailers of groceries going in and out.

20 residential houses do not get serviced by semi-trailers full of groceries. It's hardly worth commenting on this because it's so ridiculous. And then they conclude that, well, because it's not traffic that's the issue, it must be anti-religious bias.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5213s)

Yeah, let's go to the next one. 

"Myth: Fourth Avenue Gospel's development will destroy the wetlands and the walkability of the area. It will take away valuable land from the community." 

"Facts: Fourth Avenue Gospel has meticulously designed its plan to preserve the wetlands. Only 3.4% of the wetlands will be affected by the development and multiple experts were involved in the planning, including civil engineers and wetland consultants. This is a very low impact percentage as compared to any previous proposed development work done on this property. Years ago, Area N was stripped by its prior owner of any of its valuable trees [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5247s) confirmed by an expert arborist."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5249s)

It's again a classic case of putting a rebuttal out that doesn't actually answer the point. Now, I don't know if anyone has claimed that their development would damage the wetlands. I never heard any such claim. But what they're saying is it will destroy the walkability of the area. Yes, it will destroy the walkability of the area because the whole place will be behind security fences. You won't be able to use it at all.

And then they tack this random thing on the end that it was stripped by its prior owner of any valuable trees. But what's the relevance of that to any of this? I mean, if you look on Google Street View, you can see it's got a lot of nice, big mature trees as well as a lot of young trees on the site. I mean, who [cares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5295s) what the value of the trees is on the site? So this is it, this is the end of their rebuttal. So the only points that we haven't covered are basically the personal attack on me on the very first issues.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5311s)

Okay, so this is an app, it's called the Nextdoor app. I was not aware that this was happening. I was getting texts from a local resident of South Barrington asking me, "Is Julie Werle PBCC?" So I decided to, you know, I have the app, so I decided to search Julie and yes, she was... not the Julie that I know. I mean, Julie is petite, she's got hair down to her ankles, I mean it might be cut now, but back then it was down to her ankles. She's very submissive, very kind.

And here she is, her and Andrea McAbery, who happens to be Russell's wife, Russell McAbery, this PBCC spokesperson, they're having this [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5371s) with local residents and they're not actually turning the other cheek. I was shocked honestly at their social media bullying, their online, the just the way they were speaking to the actual people that could potentially be their neighbors. And it was just very, very interesting. And here's Andrea replying to someone, "After this meeting hall is built, we will be glad to have an open house once the project is finished."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5418s)

Yeah. It's kind of shocking when these are people who aren't even allowed to speak a word in their own congregation.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5428s)

In the meeting room, yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5430s)

They cut them loose to savage the residents of the area, which is...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5435s)

Yeah, so that was what was so…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5437s)

So on the one hand, it's kind of good to see Plymouth Brethren women actually having the boldness to speak out, but unfortunately what they're saying is simply not true.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5448s)

It's just the lies, like their husbands. So I'm going to read this one out. So this is Andrea McAbery.

"We interact with the community just as all residents do. We shop at local stores and use local services. We have been in the Chicagoland community for over 150 years and have good relationships with our neighbors. Please see letter below from the mayor of Northlake where we have been over the last four decades. We volunteer at local charities and donate to local food pantries. We also do a lot of outreach through RRT. We would be glad to have an open house once the project is finished."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5477s)

It's too late then, isn't it?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5479s)

This comment, this comment of Andrea's is for me, it's a weird comment unless things have changed. I mean, I left in 2009 and in 2009 you only waved to your neighbor. You did not interact with your neighbors. "We interact with the community," no, we did not. We waved. Like my neighbors, I'm [looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5509s) at their houses right now, they know Lynette before 2009 and Lynette after 2009\. And Lynette after 2009 would talk to them at the fence. She would go up to the fence and introduce herself. Like this whole thing, I don't know who is actually writing this, if it's actually the girls themselves writing it or if they've been told what to write.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5533s)

This is a Julie Werle post which starts off by, you know, calling me a liar and a criminal and so on. But then she makes a series of other points that just need comment. The first one is, "Suggestions such as the school store," these are my supposed lies, "suggestions such as the school store being a superstore with massive amounts of traffic, selling alcohol, used as a distribution centre, [trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5564s) coming day and night, etc., are false, and a promoter to stir up opposition."

Here's the school store. This is the plan submitted to Barrington Council. It's 6,405 square feet, and you can see it's 106 feet long by 67 feet wide. This is not a school store. This is a supermarket. Now we can prove this because the [Campus\&Co](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5594s) have their own internal documents that gives the size of store needed for different sized congregations. So the size of the store shown on the drawing is 6,405 square feet, which is nearly 600 square metres. It's 595 square metres, which corresponds on Campus\&Co's own documents. They say for a population of [200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5624s) to 400 congregation size, you only need 300 square metres. So this store is twice the size that will be needed for the Chicago congregation size.

Okay, so this is also a Campus\&Co internal document. And it says, 

"Large stores have fridge and freezer storage and can accept and store bulk pallets. So generally, we have large distances between small stores to maximize our buying [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5655s) and negotiate the best deals, which includes minimizing logistic costs as well as our key objective of reducing our overall volunteer labor input. We will explore the use of a hub store concept. Within our four store size model, we will identify hub stores in strategically located places. Hub stores will be larger than the population they serve,"

 Which of course this is, it's twice the size of the population it serves.

"[They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5686s) will have additional storage, preparation, manufacturing and logistics capabilities. Some examples of these are additional investments, a walk-in fridges, forklift, pallet storage area and larger delivery area to facilitate trucks."

 So now if we go back to the plan, the previous slide, we can see very clearly on the right-hand side of the store, there is a semi-trailer loading bay with [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5716s) 65-foot driveway, which is exactly the right length for a semi-trailer to back up to the loading bay without blocking the road. So when I said on my little short video that this was going to be a hub store and that it was going to have semi-trailers and a loading bay, I wasn't just inventing it. I was reading Campus\&Co's own literature, and this is exactly what it's going to be. But Julie Werle says [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5746s) lying, but the drawings say otherwise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5749s)

So going on to Julie Werle's post here, one of the other points on here that I want to point out is in this post, she says, 

"Our churches are places of public worship. This term has been wrongly interpreted to mean unlocked doors. Persons can come go as you wish. Anyone is allowed to attend services and there is a process to apply to come. Having a process is perfectly legal and is the case with other denominations."

Well, I [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5779s) to say that I do not know of any other churches where you have to apply to go. I mean, those are elite, you know, elite places like a golf course that you've got. You know, if you've got these private golf courses, yeah, you've got to apply to go to those. This isn't a golf course. These aren't elite things. This is a mainstream Christian church is what they over and over call themselves. So a mainstream Christian church shouldn't have to have an application to come. You should be able to go [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5809s) to the door and walk in on a Sunday morning when you want to attend church.

So again, Julie, you have completely taken this out of context with your lies once again. And no, your churches are not public places of worship. And if they are, then I suggest everybody to start applying to go there to show that they are not public places of worship. It's just, this is the furthest thing from the truth.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5837s)

That we can go through. When we go to church on Sunday morning, we just go to church. We park in the parking lot and we walk in and they say, "Glad to see you." You know, like there's no one that we have to email first. There's no one we have to meet with. And along those lines, when we were brethren and we had concerns about people at the morning meeting, at the Lord's supper, 6 a.m. Lord's supper, we had concerns about different people that were, at that point, when you're brethren, that's a big deal. So I don't care about it now, but at the time when we're brethren and we're only, we're in such a clean company of so pure, we're such a pure company.

We knew there were kids in Chicago that were smoking weed and we had an issue with it. So we talked to someone and said that, you know, like this conversation that we're promoting [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5904s) this pure company, people that are coming in from partying the night before and smoking weed there, it just goes against this separation narrative because we can't, no one else can come in.

 Like this separation doctrine is, this is why they talk about the way they do about other churches because, "Oh, riffraff." I was told that “Riffraff, any sort of riffraff can come into the church that you go to, Lynette” at one of my priestlies. Riffraff? No, the riffraff was at the Lord's supper inside the exclusive Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. There was some riffraff. But so yeah, this whole [narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5957s) that they are telling themselves, and you tell yourself something enough, you start to believe it. And if it's the only thing you've ever been told, that's all you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5969s)

They don't realize what a public place of worship is because they haven't experienced it. They have no clue. So to have this application to come to them is like, "Oh, well, we are a public place of worship." But I just want to let the PBCC know from the other billions of people that are on this planet besides their 50,000 plus people, that we can all contest to say that no, this is not a public place of worship. Going back to drugs, let's go on a really quick comment here about the [drugs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=5999s) I mean, weed is the last of their issues now, how many years later, because I mean, obviously that was back when you were in there. I mean, we've had so many reports of the drug issues that they have in there. It's just, the people in there have done more drugs than I've actually seen in my life outside of my home.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6019s)

And it's the like the married men, they're like the business guys doing it, right?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6024s)

But see, that's what annoys me because this separation doctrine, the people that are smoking weed and doing the drugs are still above reproach because they're still brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6038s)

Their only virtue is being in the place.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6043s)

They're still part of the holy fellowship of God's son. So that's okay. It's still okay to break bread with them, but not the riffraff that I'm breaking bread with in my communion at my church. Yeah, no one is vetted. Anyone can come in on a Sunday morning. This argument makes absolutely zero sense.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6065s)

The PBCC allow anything to go on in there as long as they're not caught. If they're caught and it's publicized, well then those people are usually shut up or withdrawn from.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6077s)

Right. Here's the thing is, Lynette, that in the brethren, you have to break bread with them even if you know they're wicked persons.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6086s)

Exactly, that's where I'm going with this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6089s)

But in your church, if you don't want to break bread with someone, if you don't want to have them around for a meal, have them to your house, you don't have to.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6096s)

Right. Yes. One of my priestlies where, I mean I'm getting off the track here, but it just annoys me that the priest said to me, "Are you okay, Lynette, with your four children spending eternity in hell?"

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6115s)

So shocking.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6117s)

And it was because I was going to a different church and I was at a rival table. I was breaking bread. Like the absurdity of the whole thing. It's just, I mean, I told him that that doesn't work with me. You can't scare me with those...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6135s)

That’s bigotry if anything is, yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17bUlhOwWNE&t=6138s)

Yeah.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
