## Summary

3 years ago, Rowan Scott was asked to record on video an attempt to get a message to Bruce Hales (the leader of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church) about how the brethren doctrines destroy families. What unfolded on that day was unexpected. Join us as we discuss Rowan’s recollection of these unusual and completely unexpected events.
Rowan also tells us about his story of leaving and in particular the authoritarian way the brethren in South Africa were told they had to leave that country. It is a fascinating insight into the level of control the leader of the brethren has over those that belong to this high control group.

### [**Announcer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=7s)

Hello everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here this evening with Anne and Ross, and our special guest tonight is Rowan Scott. Good evening, Rowan.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=20s)

Hi, Rowan.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=22s)

How are you today?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=25s)

Yeah, very well, very well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=26s)

Good, good. So Rowan was going to tell a little bit of background behind an incident that happened about three years ago relating to the Brethren. Perhaps before we do that, Rowan, you could just give us a little bit of background about yourself and who you are and when you left.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=44s)

Yeah, sure. Happy to do that. So I was born in the Brethren, obviously, in Cape Town in South Africa. I was like fifth generation of Brethren, so like my great-great-grandfather joined it back in the 1800s sometime. I think I had a reasonably happy childhood, I think like a pretty normal… Around the time, like junior school time, I was like, everything was public school back then, like the state-run school. Around about that time, there was quite a bit of turmoil or unrest amongst the younger Brethren in Cape Town. We were sort of a bit [isolated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=93s) because it was like post-Aberdeen and post the Port Elizabeth Noakes group split.

And so Mr. Symington, like he would never come out to South Africa during that time. We never had three-day meetings and that sort of stuff. And there was quite a bit of sort of rebellion amongst the younger people, and I sort of followed along. I was just a little kid, I followed along with what was going on. Yeah, so I got my first taste of rebellion then, I think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=133s)

And just to clarify, rebellion doesn't really involve anything that severe. I imagine it was...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=140s)

No, no, no. Cinemas, the normal things that kids might want to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=142s)

Oh.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=145s)

Well, I was too young for pubs or cinemas. Never did anything that bad.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=150s)

So not even that bad, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=152s)

I didn't smoke. I didn't smoke once there because there was some other young Brethren that smoked. Yes, oh that's a cool, that's obviously the cool thing to do. Yeah, so I bought a pack of cigarettes but got caught pretty soon and that was the last I ever smoked.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=178s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=181s)

But yeah, otherwise, like I'm happy with my childhood, there was nothing wrong there. High school, I was sort of when I started getting like serious about Brethren and stuff, like I was a good boy then and believing everything, took everything seriously.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=199s)

Read your white books and...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=200s)

Yeah, yeah, read the white books, used to go open-air preaching.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=206s)

Very committed, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=207s)

Oh yeah, and then it sounds like, like when it was raining, I'd go off to the open-air preaching by myself, like no one else would turn up and I'd actually say...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=222s)

Yeah, we laugh now, but it was all quite serious, wasn't it? Oh yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=231s)

And yeah, then after high school, well we had the military service, so it's like two years. Yeah, so there again, of course, you know, towing the Brethren line, keeping separate and all that kind of stuff.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=248s)

So even when you're in the military you had to observe the “no eating” and...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=254s)

Oh no, you couldn't. Like you've got to go into the mess, but you sort of, you sit there and you eat like while everyone else is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=260s)

Very surreptitious about it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=264s)

But yeah, but you don't, like you sort of, you feel like there's people around you but you feel very much alone. But still, I value the experience, I think I learned a lot. Then after the military service, it was sort of a customary thing, if you got through military service and didn't get withdrawn from during that period, then you got to go [overseas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=294s) after that. Like you got sent to three-day meetings overseas. So I got sent off to Vancouver. But that was also the time of sanctions in South Africa, it was obviously apartheid era then. So because the meetings were in Vancouver in Canada, and Canada didn't have an embassy in South Africa, we had to go to America first and then apply for a Canadian visa in the United States.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=334s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=335s)

So that resulted in me having to spend like four or five days in New York before going to Canada, which was a bit different. Like you have to stay in one place and learn one thing rather than flying all over the place like you normally do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=354s)

And was the stay in New York almost like a break, or were you still expected to go to Brethren meetings there?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=361s)

Oh no, still have to go to meetings and that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=364s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so still, yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=366s)

But it was quite nice, like because it wasn't an organized meeting in New York, it was just you're staying there to get your visa. So it was nice because I stayed with this brother that, the painting one of the markets, and I actually went to work, I just went to work with him. So I spent, like I couldn't get paid because I never had a work visa, but yes, I had a few days working, you know. But then the other part of the reason for going overseas is though, like there weren't that many people in South Africa to marry. Like it was a smaller community, like there was a marriage problem.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=410s)

Would have been in Cape Town at that time, was it quite a small meeting?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=414s)

250\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=417s)

Okay, so yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=419s)

But with the relationships and everything, it was pretty hard to actually get married. So yeah, so part of the expectation going out is you might find a wife as well. And did that happen? No, no, no. I was dead against that because it's a sin. Like, how on earth can you just see somebody and marry them? You're never going to know them until you get married. Yeah, so I was dead set against that, was not my way, so I was going to do that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=466s)

Um.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=467s)

Yeah, yeah, did that, came back. Then after that, there's still like that pressure all the time to get married. Like Mr. Symington had said that 18 to 20 was the age.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=483s)

I remember because it was the similar era, I was still in the Brethren in the sort of early 80s, a lot of girls were getting married at 16 or so, weren't they, Anne? You know, ridiculously young. And like you were, and that was my big fear, marrying at 16, 17 to somebody I just didn't know.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=504s)

So like, I just, I decided, like even because we didn't even have that much contact with Johannesburg. So Cape Town was really pretty isolated, very seldom interchange to other places in South Africa. Although, mind you, while I was in the army, I did get to see, because that was in Pretoria, so I did get to see.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=529s)

So there weren't at the time in the 80s, I mean I had relatives in South Africa, and there weren't that many meetings, were there? Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, and was there one at...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=542s)

Yeah, Durban and Pietermaritzburg are interchanged. There was Port Elizabeth and Somerset East, Somerset East was one family at that time. They interchanged and then Cape Town and Somerset West, which was basically the same place.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=560s)

But they're all quite spread out, aren't they?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=565s)

Yeah, they're very spread out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=571s)

You were in the States, sorry I digress.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=573s)

No, no, no, that's... yes, I came back from the States and then back at home in Cape Town, and it was just like that much pressure all the time to get, you know, when are you getting married? Are you getting married? Like, some of it's just joking, mostly it's probably just joking, but it's still pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so I bought a house. Oh, you had to buy a house first. And then buy a house, likeI  bought the cheapest house, the only house I could afford, the cheapest house I could buy. Got married, had kids quick, and then, yeah, I don't think it was the ideal marriage, but we had a... it wasn't a completely unhappy marriage, we had good times. 

And then, well Mr. Hales was then, John Hales was then the leader by that stage. Oh yeah, that's right. So when we were getting married, like before we got married, you know, my ex-wife, like I assumed that I would have to phone Mr. Hales. I thought that was the norm, and so did other, like some other people did. And I [rang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=648s) up the guy who was the leader in Cape Town at the time, Harold Sellers, and asked him for the phone number for Mr. Hales, and he gave it to me. And then he rang me up, he rang me back like two minutes later and he said, "Oh, you weren't thinking of calling him, were you?" And I said, "Yeah, that's what I thought I had to do."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=669s)

Didn't I? Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=672s)

And then he said, "I'll ring Mr. Painter first." You remember John Painter from...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=681s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=688s)

So yeah, I had no problems ringing him because I stayed with John Painter sometimes while I was in the army. It was good, like when we were in the army, sometimes you'd like get a weekend off or something like that and then so I stayed at his house a few times. Anyway, so I rang up John Painter and he said, "Like if there's some special reason to ring Mr. Hales, you can do it, but otherwise don't, because what can he say? Like he doesn't know you from a bar of soap." So I thought, okay, well, fair point. Okay, I was only doing it because I thought that was the expectation. So I never did ring Mr. Hales and then that was controversial because some other Brethren would say, "I did ring Mr. Hales." No, John Painter said not to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=745s)

I remember that it was just before Mr. Hales took over, everybody had to phone, I mean I think now probably they email or, but they had to phone, didn't they, Mr. Symington and then Mr. Hales, isn't that right Anne, to get the blessing on your marriage?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=761s)

Yeah, so when we were getting married, Symington was actually so ill that he wasn't taking any calls. And it was Chester Symington that Martin actually spoke to. But I think there was a time, like you say, with John Hales where he was almost too high up to even bother him about that sort of thing. Yeah, I think there was a time when more locally sort of made decisions, didn't they?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=793s)

Yeah, I got the impression from John Painter that Mr. Hales had asked him not to promote people calling him. Like I can imagine, like if you were in that position of John Hales, like people are ringing up, "Can we get married?" Like what the hell do you say? You've got to act like a man of God and give them advice, like you don't even know them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=821s)

Yeah. I do remember, I do remember my brother-in-law, Carl Humphris, phoning up John Hales and he had like these certain questions that he would ask. I'm trying to think what year that was, it must have been round about 1990 or something like that. And I just remember he said, "Are you one of these cradle snatchers?" This question. Yeah, yeah, sorry, Rowan, sorry, that's very good. 

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=860s)

Oh, so where were we?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=867s)

So yes, you'd married, you married and you had children, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=873s)

Yeah, yeah, that's right. And then, so then John Hales came a few times to South Africa to take meetings. It's like we were back, like after Mr. Symington passed, John Hales didn't mind coming to South Africa. And like he had quite a bit to say about politics. He was quite into governments and politics and whatnot. And of course he had plenty to say about the South African political situation. I think at that time, like it was just the end stage of apartheid, we were about to have general elections for everybody.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=915s)

So that would be around about mid-90s, would it be?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=921s)

Yeah, mid-90s.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=924s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=924s)

And he, like he said a lot of things, I can't even remember all the things he said. He was saying, "Oh, happiest, best days for Africa are ahead." But like the general drift of what he was saying, kind of, I felt like I had changed my opinion. Like I had thoughts and concerns, like you know, worried what might happen. And although he obviously thinks completely different about it than me, I thought, well, you know, he must be right, obviously. So I adjusted my views completely just to match his. And then march on a few years, we got, we heard that John Hales had said it was time for the Brethren to make an orderly exit out of South Africa.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=978s)

So what triggered...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=982s)

So Ray Hattingh, my uncle Ray Hattingh, he got shot dead. Just wrong place, wrong time. It wasn't a targeted attack.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=994s)

No.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=995s)

But there was a lot of unrest at that time. Yeah. They were flying all over the place. And a lot of Brethren, and not just Brethren, anybody who could was thinking of getting out of South Africa. It was super dangerous. My oldest kids were in early primary school. The kindergarten teacher put a handbag on the table, take out the pistol.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1026s)

That was normal practice.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1029s)

Yeah, normal practice. I'm going to take them out from school and there's another parent in a t-shirt, singlet, like a sleeveless thing, and you can see he's got a pistol strapped on his arm and that. Oh, there are just bullets flying everywhere. Yeah. And yeah, so a lot of people were thinking of wanting to get out of South Africa, but we never believed like Brethren would do it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1055s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1057s)

Yeah, then somebody spoke to John Hales about it, I won't mention his name, and that, yeah, and then that triggered Mr. Hales saying it was time for everyone to get out. And within a year, all the Brethren went out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1075s)

It's quite staggering really, isn't it? What I mean, is it something like, they've talked about this has happened in Australia recently, I don't know too much about it, where Bruce Hales has sort of ordered a whole families to move out of, it says it's only out of a town, but what was the Brethren, were we talking about in South Africa at that time?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1093s)

Just over a thousand.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1095s)

About a thousand, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I remember that, as an ex, because as I say, I had relatives in South Africa who are actually out of fellowship, but the parents of my uncle were in fellowship at the time and they were quite upset because his parents were elderly. And I mean, South Africa had its political issues, but they were elderly and had lived there all their lives and it was such an upheaval for them. They actually came to the UK, but you went to various different countries, the Brethren, didn't they, at that [point?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1125s)

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1126s)

Yeah, quite a few UK. I nearly moved to Brighton.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1132s)

Were you appointed where to go? I can't remember how it worked.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1141s)

No. You get job offers. So first, probably first of all I should say that the thing went around where you had to declare that you wanted to move out, so you couldn't come back on Mr. Hales.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1158s)

So effectively it was your choice.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1161s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1165s)

What would have happened if you'd refused? I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1171s)

I think we can all guess what would happen.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1176s)

I would hazard a guess there probably were some that refused. Yeah, there's some sad stories actually.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1186s)

My family split up as well. Some moved to Australia, some moved to the UK.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1193s)

It was massive at the time. It was a huge thing, wasn't it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1197s)

It was really huge. And I think it was pretty huge for the places where we went to as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1208s)

Yeah. And this was done at the time purely because John Hales deemed South Africa not a safe place to live, which whether we agree with that or not, but it was done on it. So in other words, it wasn't each individual's decision directly to say, "I don't want to live in this country, I'm going to move out." It was kind of a directive that came from him, wasn't it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1230s)

Yeah, effectively. They were very careful. So where did you and your family go then? So we moved to Tamworth in Australia. So my brother was, my oldest brother moved to Armidale, which is the interchange with, and then we all got job offers. The whole of my father's family wanted to move to kind of the same place. Yeah, so my wife's family got split up because they went to Stafford in the UK.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1271s)

Right. Okay. That must have been pretty hard for her then.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1277s)

Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, because she was also from Cape Town and so it was like, so we were like all Cape Town, her parents, my parents, everyone was...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1288s)

Okay, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1290s)

Yeah, that was very hard. Yeah, so we moved to Tamworth. Yeah, so that was quite an upheaval. I'll probably have to remind myself with the notes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1309s)

It's a blur now.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1314s)

Yeah, so that was, that was 1999 we moved.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1317s)

Okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1318s)

Yeah, so just on the turn of the century, nearly. Yeah, we had to adjust to country living there, like come from the city, Tamworth is very much a country place. All right, that all went well and then there was not too long, I don't know when the September 11 attacks were in America.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1344s)

2001\.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1345s)

It was only a few years. Yeah. Yeah. So a couple of years after, yeah. Yeah. And then following after that, the war in Iraq. Now that disturbed me a lot, that war in Iraq is like, it seemed obviously wrong, but there was a lot of talk, at least where around where I was, amongst the Brethren, like, you know, saying what a great thing, America must just go and wipe them all out and what they need is a big atomic bomb on the whole area.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1383s)

Wow, wow.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1385s)

I found that like really disturbing, and that's when I started really thinking like, hang on, this doesn't sound right. And then I started questioning, you know, what actually is right? And how come, how come if it's right for me to believe what I've been taught from my parents and my church, how come it's fine to just bomb kids that believe in what, you know, what their parents taught them and their church teaches them? What's the difference? Where's this and why is it different to mine? And I think that maybe that questioning is what actually opened the door for me to question more things. And then somewhere around that time, I heard that John Hales had said things didn't work out in South Africa like he expected to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1455s)

Oh.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1455s)

And that, that took me, that really took me because, well, they worked out pretty much like I expected. There were no surprises in the South Africa situation for me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D1471s)

And did he elaborate at all on what he thought was going to... of course.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1482s)

Which I presume is true, and when I presume it's true anyway, because he was so positive about everything's going to be hunky-dory in South Africa in the 90s.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1496s)

I think, I think there was quite a lot of, from what I remember at that time, a lot of the, once South Africans that moved, it did cause a ripple effect, you know, with the things started to happen and people, a lot of the South Africans got quite disgruntled with their lives. And I know there was things happened, yeah, after moving. Yeah, which is, I don't know if that was what he referred to or whether he was trying to, yeah, no, it was in some way...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1533s)

No, it was in the, I don't know why he would have, I gather it was just like a comment in passing, like not an official in the meeting comment, no.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1543s)

No, one of those comments that gets passed around with, yeah, yeah, sort of, "Our beloved brother said that." That's very common, isn't it? Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1551s)

Yeah, that's right. But the upshot of it was for me was like, why must I change my opinion to somebody else's when they can be wrong? Okay, yeah, yeah. Like I'd rather, I'd rather have my own opinion and make my own mistakes. Yeah. I don't mind being wrong, no problem with that at all. But why must I believe what someone else believes, and they were, and they're wrong? Yeah, so that opened it. Like from there on, that was just a gradual process of working that all together.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1588s)

Pause on that thought process for a moment, because I empathize with that. I've always said the day you ask one question in the Brethren about how come, you do one of two things. You either block that question out and live with the cognitive dissonance that that creates, or you ask more questions. And actually, if you ask more questions, you're kind of on the road to either being very unhappy or leaving anyway, because it sort of opens the [floodgates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1618s) of questions. Is that how it felt?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1620s)

Yeah. Yeah, but it was quite liberating. So like once you start asking and allowing yourself to actually question, and like the truth can handle questions.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1634s)

And if anyone in is listening, I would say keep asking questions, wouldn't you? Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1642s)

Yeah, don't be scared to ask questions. God won't punish you for a question.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1649s)

Question the hell out of everything.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1650s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1657s)

Quote, wasn't there, by some one of the bigwigs, I don't think it was a Hales, but do you remember this quote being said that someone, I think it was someone like... your sound's breaking up a little bit, Ross... was it, was there a Jackson or someone that moved to the Hague? Clarkson? Oh, sorry, can you not hear? It's coming and going a bit, but you're all right at the moment. It's a bit delayed.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1693s)

We all want to know what this quote was. Yeah, I remember, I know who you're talking about, Ross. Do you remember? It was...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1702s)

Alan Clarkson. It was Alan Clarkson, I think. Mr. Clarkson or someone from the Hague. He moved to the Hague from... Can you hear me? Sorry. Just move on. You'll have to put the quote in the chat.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1730s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1731s)

Put it in the chat. What's going on? Yeah, sorry. Move on. It's okay, Ross, you can't help it. At least it's not my camera this time. Yeah. Sorry, Rowan. So you were in there starting to ask questions about why should you align your opinion with the Mr. Hales and then find out Mr. Hales is wrong? And was that your slippery slope?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1758s)

Yeah, I'd say so. And then my life did get miserable in the Brethren because it just becomes more, the more you, the more you question and allow yourself to think, like the more you realize it's really up the creek.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1778s)

Yes.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1779s)

And like I went, I went way back, like I didn't really even believe in God anymore, or barely, I should say. I've got, like I was questioning that too. And but what, what was really difficult for me was all the, all the like talking, the breaks and that kind of stuff, like it really grated on me. So like I became obviously unhappy, like other Brethren knew I wasn't happily in fellowship anymore. Like I didn't make, I didn't take part in the meetings or anything like that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1825s)

Did you actually speak to anybody about the questions or was it just obvious that you were unhappy?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1833s)

I spoke to my wife about it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1836s)

Okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1839s)

And she could sympathize in the beginning, but then she got cold feet, I think, later on. So no, eventually I couldn't speak to anyone about it. Like if you do, it just comes back at you from someone else.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1853s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1854s)

Yes, I just kind of kept it to myself. But then, you know, they had this thing, they probably still do it, like if you're not happy inside there, like they try and find a job for you to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1882s)

Yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, no, no, I'll read it out. I remember hearing this, sorry, Rowan, I'm digressing again. I remember it, so yeah. "Don't believe everything you hear and only half of what you see." Was that right? Was that the quote, Ross? Something like that. Yeah, something like that. It's very vague in my memory. Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1902s)

Yeah. Yeah, I can't remember who from, but I did remember hearing that in the Brethren. Yeah. So, so there was going to be some meetings in Tamworth and there were two brothers that used to do the break allocation. And they asked me if I could help doing the break allocations for these three-day meetings or whatever they were.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1929s)

So maybe just for people who are not ex-Brethren, we could explain what the break allocations are. It was basically when the Brethren would meet up in between, wouldn't they? And you'd then have to, somebody would have to decide who was going to whose house. Is that correct?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1947s)

Yeah, that's correct.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1948s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1950s)

So everybody had to like sort of be accounted for, you know.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1956s)

You had to decide who was having the break and then who was going there. And it's quite a job, anyway. So I said, "Okay, sure, I'll help, I'll help you do that." And then I went around to one of their houses one evening to see how they did it and like the system was and all that sort of thing. And then this guy just said, "Okay, well, you know, you take all the stuff home." And I said, "Oh no, you've got it now, like you're doing it on your own."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1989s)

Right.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=1991s)

So I was basically tricked into doing the break allocations. I didn't mind doing that. I made my own little system for doing it because I was pretty sure. And then, yeah, I made like a little system of cards and whatnot. It worked pretty cool. But this is before the days of computers. But it was in the days when they had those fun-days, remember the fun-days for all the like the nonsense that went on in those, like that also grated me like just the hypocrisy of it. Like the stuff that was supposed to be very worldly now was the thing to do all together in the group. Yeah. And so those grated on me. And during one fun-day, I thought, oh, stop this. I just left the funday. I went up in the car and I bought myself a laptop. And I started doing the breaks on a laptop. I worked out another system to do it there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2060s)

And this would have been at a time when computers were not used at all, would it? Because the Brethren were very anti-computers and technology, weren't they, initially?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2072s)

Yeah. Yeah. So there might have been like talk, there may be going to be, but no one had a computer yet. Maybe fax machines had just come in or something. Oh, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2089s)

Wordex. We had Wordex for a while.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2092s)

Yeah. So the Wordex was the first computer that the Brethren brought out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2098s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2100s)

And so I happened to get like one of the first Wordexes that came out. Okay. Because it was like it was known that I was using a computer for the breaks.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2114s)

Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. That made it acceptable, did it? Because you're using it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2120s)

Oh, I don't know. I don't know what the rationale was. Who knows, yeah. You obviously turned wrong because in later years they were using computers to do all the allocation anyway. So well, like when the Wordexes came out, my break program, got quite a few people asked me, "Oh, I can't use the Wordex." It's kind of designed just for us, but yeah, you can give it a go.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2151s)

So what I'm thinking is that they're asking you to do the break allocations. Do you think that was at the time, you mentioned you felt tricked into doing that, that's how you felt. Do you think that was part of the plan? They could see a certain distancing and it was a way of perhaps trying to include, would you, draw you back in?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2171s)

Yeah, I probably was. Like, I had that very, like you know, if someone's not happy, you just like send them on an encouragement trip over.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2184s)

Yeah, this was the equivalent of encouraging.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2187s)

Important, yeah, yeah. But probably another reason was I think these two brothers were sick of doing it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2195s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2199s)

You got that, and then, and they did it poorly too. Like, yeah, I think everyone was complaining about the allocation. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so that's how, that's how I got into computers. Like, I sort of have a bit of the, I've always been interested in computing. Like when I was in, when I was in high school, like it was just the, like the early days of the Apple II and that sort of original home computer thing. And we had a computer club at our school which was only two members, which are both friends of mine. I used to go and watch them doing their programming.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2239s)

Okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2239s)

Yeah, so I've always, I've always liked electronics and computers. Yeah, so that was great that I could get, I get my own computer and like amazingly, no one took issue with it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2251s)

We're quite happy with it.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2253s)

Yeah. There were some complaints. And I think some people assumed that it must, like because I was doing breaks on it, that it must be a legit Brethren computer.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2267s)

How funny. That's quite funny actually. Yeah. Yeah. So what was the catalyst then to you finally leaving, or was it just a gradual slope?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2279s)

Gradual slope, like I became, I became more and more unhappy as time went on, like because it felt like nowhere. I was going to, like I was going to do myself in at one stage. I thought, no, this was, but anyway, I'm like, like when I got to that stage where like my kids were teenagers, they were, you know, in there. Yeah, my wife was, my ex-wife I should say, was now like, there's no way she was going to come out. [Okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2310s). Like I had, I wanted to get the whole family out of the Brethren, but I felt like no way to do that. I was going to do myself in, I thought. Then, like I did some research first. Like 10,000 people a year in Australia commit suicide. I thought, well, that doesn't prove anything, does it? Yeah. Like to me, it would be like a statement of how unhappy I am, plus an escape. Yeah, yeah. So I thought, well, no, well, that's definitely not an option because it proves nothing and it doesn't help for future generations either. Like, someone committing suicide, their kids are more likely statistically to commit suicide too.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2356s)

Yeah, but once again, we hear the same tale of somebody unhappy and seriously considered taking their own life. I mean, thankfully, suicides inside the Brethren are covered up.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2378s)

I don't know about you Rowan, but I think you almost have to get to that point to leave. Well, that's the turning point. It's a turning point. For me, it was for me too, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2391s)

Yeah, so when you choose life, you know, it can't be a life in there.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2393s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2395s)

Yeah, yeah, that's right. So at that point, that's okay, well, that's not an option. Like anything is better than that and getting out anyhow is better than that. And then that was like just total relief. Like it doesn't matter now. Like yeah, yeah. And so like the family relationship was up to shit, like that was rubbish. And I got on to, like I started making plans, like now, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2427s) do I get out? What's going to do? I was going to join the Navy at one stage or what not. I thought of joining the Navy at one stage because the Brethren was still like pro-military. So I thought like this at least will be less of the shame for the family, like a bit of a hero thing to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2446s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2448s)

But I didn't do that. Then I got, I did, I did go into an online dating site, which I'm not proud of. I was still married, but I did. And it's a perfect thing to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2468s)

When you're unhappy, Rowan, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2469s)

Yeah, I was just, I was just kind of thinking, oh, this is a bit of a dead end too, like there's not much success. Yeah. And then I happened to meet somebody who was, like got on really well with chatting, and that was an absolute help because I could just tell her, I told her just plainly like what my situation was. And they weren't nearby, like it was only like a long-distance relationship thing. And which had, that [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2500s) a huge help. Like I just felt so much better because you could, you could just tell somebody what was going on on a day-to-day basis and it doesn't come back at you or no one's judging you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2508s)

Yeah, and that's the interesting thing. I think a lot of people I know that have left, particularly if they've been married, it has been, not I'm not saying having an affair necessarily, but it's literally they find someone to talk to. And that person they can talk to, and they suddenly realize they're not being judged, they're not being told, "You've got to think like this and you've got to get right." And that's a revelation, isn't it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2530s)

Yeah, yeah. And then, yeah, then that was, that was the beginning of the end, I think. That only went on to about like six months.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2538s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2539s)

And I didn't, I didn't exactly cover it up very well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2548s)

So you almost allowed yourself to get found out that you were talking to somebody else.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2553s)

Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Well, not like deliberately. No, no, no. Yeah. No. Sorry about being too discreet about it. Yeah. And like I hadn't been going to meetings for a year, including the supper. Like I'd only go, okay, I'd only go to the Sunday reading because so that I could be with the family during the break.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2580s)

And were you still living with the family at that point? I mean for that year? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2584s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when it, when it came to the crunch, like my wife decided to leave me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2589s)

Right.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2590s)

Okay, and the family went with her. So I didn't leave the house, they left the house. And as soon as they left the house, then I got confined. And that was it. I got some priestly visits after that. I enjoyed them, they were fun.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2618s)

Priestly visit fun. I suppose if you're approaching them from the point of view, you're fairly comfortable in your own mind with the decision you've made, you have a different approach. I guess it depends on your own vulnerability and your state of mind at the time, doesn't it? And we're all different there, aren't we? Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2640s)

I loved my, I loved the priestly visit because it was for me, it was, it give me an opportunity to challenge them. And they didn't know what to say because I'd already made my decision. It didn't matter what they said to me, so I could ask them questions. And so often they didn't have answers. No, yeah, you know. And then I would go, "Well, that's exactly why I'm where I am, because you don't have answers."

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2664s)

I mean my last priestly visit, the way I coped with it was, I was sort of like just listening and politely to them saying, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes." And then I just turned around and said, "Basically, I don't believe in a word you've been saying. And I don't believe this, and I don't believe that. You know, I'm not interested, basically. You know, there's the door."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2682s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2683s)

Yeah, and that was it. Yeah, I think there's, I think there's a big difference in people who want to leave and choose to leave, like us, than people that are thrown out unexpectedly. And those are really harrowing times for those people, aren't they? You know, if you choose to leave, you've got, you've got the upper hand, you know.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2710s)

Yeah, yeah. And like I was 45, like I knew, and I've been thinking about it for 10 years nearly already. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Someone like a, like a, like a 18-year-old girl and two adult men coming grilling her, like someone...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2728s)

Well, it's just so intimidating. Yeah. In a situation like that, where a young girl wanting to leave doesn't have any representation, any support, it's fundamentally wrong, isn't it? Not even to have parents in with her or anybody is fundamentally wrong. And so you left about 10 years ago then, Rowan? Is that at 10, 12?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2756s)

2011, so 12 years ago.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2764s)

Go on.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2765s)

So yeah, so they left us. I was left, like we had five kids, so it was originally a big house. One thing, like I made lots of plans when I, I'm like on coping mechanisms on when the crunch came, like I knew it would come. Like one was, stop drinking from here. Like I used to drink quite a bit while I was still in the Brethren, like that was part of my self-medication and consciously. So plans to stop drinking, and like I started my own little business so I had something to do. Like it wasn't profitable in the beginning, but that's something to do at least once I was kicked out, because I lost my job, everything all in one week. One thing I didn't think of was friends, which is, it's probably a good thing I didn't think of it because I don't, like I've never made friends easily, like you know, in school [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2825s) you know, taught from a baby on up to keep separate. But that surprisingly was never a problem. Yeah. So as I, when I was leaving my job, like I got a few days to pack up and go, I went to the accountant at work who was a non-Brethren accountant and told him what was happening and asked them to, you know, just keep an eye on what my boss...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2858s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2859s)

So he said, "Yeah, he'll look at, he'll like, he'll look after me." And then he messaged me straight away, like we became friends straight after and I went around to his place for dinner and that sort of thing. Or and even like, I went to an estate agent to like get a, to get a valuation on the house and the, you know, to prepare for the inevitable separation, legal separation and divorce. And he came around to see the house and I say, "Oh, you know, what's the go? You know, single guy, big house." I just told anybody that asked, I just told them the whole story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They came around the next day with a whole pack of movies for me to watch.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2909s)

Bit of catching up to do.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2912s)

My first movie was Forrest Gump.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2915s)

Really? Oh really? Yeah, fantastic.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2924s)

You know how when you're in the Brethren and you go past, you see the cinema and it's got like a movie name.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2928s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2931s)

And I have to see Forrest Gump and wondering what’s a Forrest Gump...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2939s)

Yeah, it's quite funny how those things don't mean anything, do they? Those titles, you don't know what they're for, what is it? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2949s)

Yeah, so I watched the movie and like we've been taught, like I remember John Painter saying in the meeting, like talking about movies are acting out, some people acting out sin for other people to enjoy it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2965s)

That's the movie, is it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2968s)

Yeah, so I watched Forrest Gump and I thought, oh my goodness, like this has got way more moral value than any preaching I've heard inside the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2978s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2978s)

Yeah, anyway, so making friends was just not a problem.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2987s)

And presumably, like a lot of people in your situation, you didn't particularly see or hear from your kids or your ex-wife again?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=2995s)

No, so my youngest, well not, well she's not, a little bit, but my youngest was seven. That was like really the hardest. All the others were teenage or grown up. So yeah, that was like the real, well, and she came, she came to visit a few times, but then that just stopped altogether.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3019s)

Yeah, as it does.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3021s)

And then I used to get letters, like used to get a letter from my ex-wife with the school report and maybe a photo or two. But yeah, minimal. I found that like a slap in the face really, like because the story has the obligatory school report thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3040s)

It's, it's almost, it must have felt like it was done because she felt she had to. There's no, yeah, yeah, it's more like it is, there no, no...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3050s)

Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I can say no feeling, but it kind of a strange feeling.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3058s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3059s)

You know how it is when you're in the Brethren and you think you're doing...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3061s)

Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can all see both points of view, can't we? Because we've all been there.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3066s)

Yeah, I think, I think that's one thing, you know, in doing these podcasts is we've realized how hard it is for those inside. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3077s)

Well, like I actually feel like more like survivor's guilt.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3082s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3083s)

I feel like, yeah, great, like it's always been hard like separating from family and that, but my life's great.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3092s)

And I think that's for me, that's one of the main motivations for doing what I do in trying to expose what's going on, is that survivor's guilt. Because it'd be very easy to turn your back and get on, but you feel you can't when members of our own families are in there and when people are unhappy in there. It's, it is, it's, which is why this has all come about, isn't it? 

Yeah, in many ways. Yeah, yeah. So one thing we wanted to talk to you about was an [incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3122s) that happened about three years ago, I believe, outside the Hales' house in Australia. And what I wanted to do, if it's okay, is share a newspaper article about it that contains a short video. So if you bear with me, I will share my screen. And it does sometimes take a minute or two to load. So this newspaper article came out, just let me know if you can see it, and you will see it there.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3160s)

It's not come up yet.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3161s)

It tells me it's still loading.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3164s)

Yeah. Was this when Lance was in Australia, that tour he did?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3181s)

Yeah, one of the times.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3185s)

Can you see it all now? Yeah, yeah. So the headline, it's written by Michael Bachelard, who we know has done a lot of writing about the Brethren. And the headline says, "Exclusive Brethren, cult leader's millionaire's son, accused of assault." And we won't read the whole article, but it's online for anyone that wants to. But it does contain, sorry, let me scroll up a little bit to get that central on the screen, a video. It's only a few seconds long. I was going to play the video. Then maybe, Rowan, you can explain what happened there.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3228s)

It's taking a little while to load.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3233s)

You look a bit ruffled there, Rowan.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3238s)

I'll tell you about that in a minute. Okay. Right, I've just had a notification my internet is unstable at the moment. Oh, that's great. Yes, it worked earlier, didn't it? Rowan, perhaps what I'll do is I'll stop sharing, then reshare, but perhaps if you sort of explain the gist of the point on that day, and when we can get...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3264s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3265s)

It's quite an interesting story, isn't it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3271s)

Yeah, well I suppose it is. It's got quite a few views.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3277s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3279s)

I wasn't exactly dressed for going viral.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3284s)

If you'd known, you'd have washed your hair, would you? Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3296s)

Oh, is that going?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3297s)

Okay, I'll just see if it'll go again.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3302s)

I'll just, I'll just be talking about it and see if it'll go again.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3306s)

Yeah, just talk over it because it's, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3307s)

Yeah, okay. So, Lance Christie, we'd had quite a bit of communication in the past, me and Lance. He stayed with me on my boat for a while and anyway, he rang me up one day asking if I could take a video for him outside Bruce Hales's house, like on the public footpath. I'd taken him to Bruce Hales's house before to [deliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3339s) letters and stuff. So it was a Saturday, I believe. I'd spent that day, me and my partner Ellie, spent that day cleaning up the boat because we were going to sell it in preparation to move to Thailand. We're now living in Thailand. Yeah, so like a super busy day for me, out all day, tidying up the boat, packing stuff in the car and whatnot.

 And but it was, it was Lance's like only opportunity to go and do it, so I didn't want him to miss it. So I asked him to get himself to, I think it's Eastwood station or Ryde station, there's a railway station near Bruce Hales's house, and then I would meet him there in the car. So yeah, he agreed to do that.

 And then I dropped, this was quite late in the evening, I've just been putting it on, I dropped Ellie off at our apartment in Camperdown in Sydney and then drove on to the station to pick up Lance. And then like when I got near the station, I pulled over and rang him or messaged him or something to ask him if he was there yet. Yeah, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3422s) he said he had arrived, he was going into such and such a shop near the station. So I drove on, found that shop. Now as I was going past the shop, I saw a car, like a like a minivan type or Range Rover, whatever it was, like a typical Brethren car, and a guy hopping out of the passenger seat and running to look in that very shop. And the guy was to look like, yeah, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3458s), that's odd. 

But I'm not one to jump to a conclusion, so I didn't think too much of it. And then, so I went past that shop and pulled into the parking area so I could stop and find where Lance was. And I saw that this, so the guy had run and jumped back in his car and they'd done a U-turn and zoomed off the other direction. So I rang up Lance and he said, "Oh, he's gone out of the shop and he's walking in the same direction the car has just driven off in." Like he told me the direction he's going. I, oh well, that's another oddity because he's walked that way, the car zoomed off there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3502s)

Great, so did it appear from that, appear from that that the Brethren were trying to tail Lance?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3509s)

Oh, it certainly did, yes. Yeah, yes, because I know like Lance has told me before about him being tailed, yeah, in Sydney and in New Zealand too.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3521s)

Right.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3522s)

But yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3525s)

Yeah, and do you think they would have had, well they probably wouldn't have had any reason at that point to know his intentions to go and visit Mr. Hales, Bruce Hales's house, would they?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3536s)

No, no, except that we had, like we had before.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3539s)

Okay, so it's the second time.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3542s)

Or third.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3543s)

Or third time. Okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3547s)

One of the times we'd had an interaction with the security guard.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3551s)

Okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3556s)

I'll get to that later, actually.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3558s)

Okay. So just to sort of clarify on that point, if I've understood this correctly, when Lance was in the Brethren, I knew he met Bruce Hales, so Bruce Hales would have known who he is, wouldn't he? Oh yeah, yeah, they knew each other. But his intentions were to just go and talk to Bruce Hales, weren't they?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3576s)

Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so Lance's view was like the scriptural thing of, you know, if someone's offended you, go and talk. Yeah, I'm sure Lance, that's all he wants to do. But yeah, I'm very willing to help him and it's like a very genuine, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3603s)

Yeah, I mean the point of what I say that is because Lance's intentions at that point were no more than trying to go and talk to sort out something he perceived to be a problem, that there was nothing more sinister.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3616s)

No, no. So what he was wanting to do was, he had prepared a speech.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3621s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3622s)

Like it wasn't going to do a speech, and we're going to just video it in front of the, just on the footpath there. It's a public footpath, you can do it wherever.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3631s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3634s)

So yeah, so that was the intention. So I found Lance, we got into the car, we got it, and then I waited in the parking and I said, "Okay, just tell me," like I wanted to know what we were doing. So I got him to recite the speech to me and I thought, that's actually very good, that was brilliant. And it's okay, let's do this, I'm in.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3659s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3660s)

And so I drove him around very, very close to the house where we wanted to go, the footpath we wanted to go. But what I was going to say before was the security guard there had told us it wasn't Bruce Hales's house.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3681s)

Oh really? Oh well in that case it was just a footpath outside a house.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3690s)

I was like happy, like wondering now, is someone going to be there? Because if this really is Brethren snooping on him, then they're going to know he's in the area. So sure enough, I parked a little bit up the street and we walked towards where we were going to take the video. And as we've walked up there, I went to the other side of the street just so I could get some photos first. I was using Lance's phone. And then there was a guy walking down the footpath. I thought I'll just wait for him to pass before taking some more photos. And then Lance said, "Oh, Rowan, come over here. This is Gareth." Now, I wouldn't have known Gareth from a bar of soap.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3744s)

No.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3744s)

I think I've seen him once in the brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3747s)

Yeah. And Gareth is Bruce Hales' eldest son, is that correct?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3752s)

I don't know. I have no idea.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3754s)

He's his son anyway.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3756s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3758s)

Do you know where he is in the family? He's the eldest. He's the eldest, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3765s)

Yeah. So I went over to them and then, I forget the exact conversation, but it was kind of like saying, "Oh, you know, come down the street here," because we were already like right outside Bruce Hales's house, which is the corner of the property. And yeah, they were also having, like Lance was off having a chat with with Gareth. And I was, I've had enough when I get to the end of my short rope, and I said, "No, look, I've agreed to come and take a video, I've not agreed to go in for a conversation." Because I told Ellie, like I'll be probably an hour and a bit maybe. That's gonna go. So yeah, that's why I'm dressed like that. I've come straight off the boat, [hadn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3814s) gone inside or anything.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3818s)

Your moment of fame wasn't planned for.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3834s)

Yeah, so I said, "Look, I'm coming out to take a video. You do the video first, then you can go have your chat and you can catch a train home or something." So I started, and I started the camera, right? I was like, "Okay, we're rolling. Go there, do your video." Yeah, so that's where the beginning of that video is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3856s)

Can we see if it will share now?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3859s)

I've got it going and immediately Gareth has made a lunge at the camera. Okay, let's see. I hope we can get it to play. It's only a few seconds. It's still loading.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D3875s)

When Gareth approached Lance, was he friendly? I don't know because I was on the other side of the street. So the first I knew was Lance telling me this is Gareth.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3890s)

Right. I think it was like acting friendly. Right. Right. Yeah, like it didn't come out with...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3906s)

No, I don't think that would happen.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3909s)

No, no. But yeah, as soon as the camera was rolling, then he made a lunge and grabbed me behind the neck.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3919s)

And that was what the... I apologise, it's just not loading. I will try again. We will get it loading because it did earlier, but I keep getting internet unstable notifications. So carry on. He grabbed you, Rowan, did he?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3934s)

So he grabbed me, this is really quite a blur because it happened all so fast, but he grabbed me behind the neck and he was like, he was trying to get the phone, which was…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3948s)

So his concern appeared to be he just wanted that video to stop.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3954s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3955s)

That he was trying to get the phone, is that as you...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3957s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he didn't, he didn't say please can we stop the video. No, he just grabbed you. Yeah, he did say stop the video, I think, I think it's on the video.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3975s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=3977s)

But yeah, so his one hand was on my neck, I think his other hand must have been on my other arm. So that means both his hands were busy and I was holding the camera where he couldn't get it. And then that was just like locked in that position and we were talking, but he was saying, "Stop the video." I was saying, "I can't." Like, there's nothing I could do. Like I couldn't even stop the video.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4004s)

Presumably you didn't have a hand free to do so because if you're holding the phone in one hand and he's holding your other hand, was that correct? Then you didn't have a hand free to stop the video. Use your feet.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4021s)

But not like, not while you're being jostled.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4023s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4024s)

And then I'm convinced there was a motorcycle involved.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4032s)

There was a...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4033s)

A guy on a motorcycle. I could hear the, like I couldn't really see much because my head was pushed down. But I'm sure there was a motorcycle involved and I thought this guy was going to intervene, but then he disappeared. So I don't know, I don't know what the go was. But then I could see, like while my head was down, I could see another guy approaching. I thought it was just a passerby. And when he got close, I said, "Please, can you help me?" And I think, I think I might have been able to stop the video by that stage. Like I was always going to stop, I didn't want to get, he's very strong, you know, I think he must work out or something. 

And then I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4071s) the video, what, I think I said the video has stopped, which it had, because it was not on the camera. And then he let me go, just as this other guy was approaching. And then I backed off, I started walking away, and then turns out this other guy was just another one of the Hales' sons.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4094s)

So it wasn't a good Samaritan passing by? I don't know, not at all. It was his cavalry.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4102s)

Yeah, but he was just as angry. But he came sort of following me, like I walked off back down the street a bit and he came following me, like right behind me, sort of bumped into me a bit.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4117s)

Right.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4118s)

I feel like he just turned around and faced him and I was like, "Hey, you can't go now."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4122s)

Did that feel a bit intimidating?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4125s)

Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I imagine, I imagine you're, I imagine you're very shaken up anyway at this point. Oh yeah, yeah, I was shaken up. Like I'm not used to altercations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4138s)

No, no, no. So what happened next?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4146s)

So I went back to the car and then I waited for Lance. So I, well I rang, I rang the police too. They didn't arrive quickly. They didn't arrive at all, which didn't really matter. Like it wasn't, I'd say like it's not a, I'd rang the triple zero (000), that's like an emergency. I said like, it's not an ongoing threat right now, so it wouldn't have been urgent. And then when Lance came back to the car, then we drove to the police station and made reports there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4184s)

And what was the outcome? Because as I'm just going back to the headline, but the headline sort of says, was this, he was challenged with assault or charged with assault? I can't remember what it said.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4196s)

No, not charged. He wasn't charged. I think it said accused. Accused. Sorry, I get my wording correct. It does. You're right. Well, I certainly accused him on the video. I think you can hear me saying, "This is assault" or something like that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4209s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll try and get that up again.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4215s)

I'm pretty sure it is a clear, pretty clear assault.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4217s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. Well, it's physical, it's, I can't remember the actual, there's specific wording, isn't there? And physical contact that is not welcome is classed as assault. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4233s)

Yeah, something like that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4239s)

Yeah, okay. Let's see if we have a little bit more uploading the video this way. If we pause a second. Okay, that might be beginning to load. I don't know what you can see. I don't want this. No.

**Rowan Scott**

Please leave us alone.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4266s)

 Don't film. Don’t film.

### [**Lance Christie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4269s)

We've been told that we've got a right to do it.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4273s)

Don't do this.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4275s)

Put that down. Put that down. Put that down. Tell him to put that down now. 

**Lance Christie**

Stop that. Stop that

**Gareth Hales**

Put that down, sunshine. Put that down, buddy.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4285s)

No, I won't.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4286s)

Just put that down.

**Lance Christie**

Don’t get violent.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4289s)

I'm not, but put that down. Put that down, buddy. Turn that phone off.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4295s)

Let me go.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4296s)

I’ll talk to ya, turn that phone off.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4297s)

I cannot while you're holding me. You're not taking it. 

Lance Christie

Let's be decent.

### [**Gareth Hales**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4305s)

Oh, I'll talk to you, bro. Just turn his phone off.

**Lance Christie**

Turn it off now, Rowan. Turn it off, okay? Turn it off now, please.

**Rowan Scott**

Let me…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4320s)

We got there, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4324s)

I should, I probably should have sent you the original.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4326s)

That, that's okay. It's, I think I thought actually listening through to that, I heard a motorbike in the background. I don't know if anyone else did. You could sort of hear it. Yeah, I just very vaguely. Now you've told the story, I was sort of listening a bit more. He sounds quite forceful, doesn't he, Gareth? As in, "Turn that phone off." Yeah. So you...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4361s)

Yeah, we went to the police station. It's, yeah, not just, not too sure how much we should say about the interactions with the police, but they certainly knew about Brethren. Yeah, not in a good way.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4383s)

Okay, yeah, that's interesting, yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4386s)

Yeah, they took statements from both of us. And then, went back, went back sometime later to the police station. Oh no, we got a call, they called us to come in. Well, Lance was back in UK by then.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4406s)

Yes.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4407s)

But I went around there with Craig Stewart. And the police sergeant said that they were not going to charge him. So the way he said it, it sounded like it wasn't his decision.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4432s)

Yes, there's an instant question as to why, if you wanted to press charges, but perhaps we better not delve into that one. But we'll just leave that question hanging, shall we?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4444s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4444s)

Good idea.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4445s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4447s)

So charges were never actually pressed for assault?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4451s)

No, not criminal charges by the police. We were going to, or Lance was going to press the, like a civil case, I think they call it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4465s)

Yes, it's a civil case, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4468s)

But yeah, COVID and whatnot.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4471s)

Yeah. And it's also the fact that if there's a criminal case, then the Crown, well, certainly in the UK, and I think it's the same in Australia, the Crown would be the case. So there's a cost implication. If you elect to bring a civil case, you have to fund it yourself, basically. There's that aspect to it as well, isn't there? Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4490s)

I mean, I couldn't do it. It's kind of a pity that someone can get away with that in Australia. But really, it's not a big deal for me. I was late home for dinner.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4505s)

Yes, it took longer than the hour, you promised.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4511s)

It's more the principle of it though, isn't it? The hypocrisy of it, because they preach all this wonderful Christian stuff and that isn't Christian behaviour.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4523s)

No. It shows the controlling, it shows the control because he's so strong in the way he's talking to you as if he's got every right to tell you to put it down and to stop videoing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4542s)

Yeah, there's no "please" in it, is there? No. No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4547s)

And what also seems to come across in the demeanour in that video is something that's been touched on an awful lot, is the sort of rather arrogant, bullying attitude that some of the Brethren have as well. "I've told you to stop that phone, you will." And that, it's quite overpowering, isn't it?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4576s)

I was just going to say it's thuggish behavior, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4578s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what, what you wonder is, and of course everything we say now is pure speculation because we don't know the motives for the actions that were taken, but you do wonder about the motives. 

And is that sort of thing a pattern of behavior? Was it a one-off? I mean, this is speculation, but does it come from that arrogance that sometimes, I mean, I often say the Brethren as a [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4608s), and this is no judgment on personal people in the Brethren, they kind of have a superiority complex because they've been told all their lives they're special. But when you're at the top of the hierarchy of the Brethren, is that arrogance and superiority complex superbly enhanced? Oh, I would think so, I would think so.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4627s)

Yeah, it's probably, it's probably enhanced to the tune of they think they're untouchable.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4632s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the system that, it's like an ecosystem as they call it, isn't it? And they're top of the food chain, so they have the right to tell every other person below them exactly what they should or shouldn't be doing. And they believe that themselves.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4659s)

Yeah, totally. And that's the scary part about it, is that they, you know, they believe it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4662s)

Yeah, yeah, totally. And the other bit I'm curious to ask, Rowan, and this may be a difficult question to answer because it seems as if your head was upside down at that point in time, but what was Gareth's demeanor like? I mean, you know, was he sort of, was it friendly but wary demeanor, was it aggressive? What was your impression? Again, we're not saying or casting any more, what was your impression of his demeanor?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4692s)

I wouldn't say it's friendly, or at least not like any friends I know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4697s)

It didn't seem too friendly on that video, I have to say. On that 50 seconds we did see, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4704s)

Yeah, I don't, I don't know how...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4708s)

Do you think that he, I mean, again, this is speculative, do you think he would have had reason to feel threatened? Or do you not think that that was...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4717s)

Well, okay, not reasonable reasons, I don't think. No, well, not rational, not rational reasons. But I can, like I do, like it is outside Bruce Hales's house.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4737s)

But equally to rationalize...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4740s)

I can understand them being defensive, but that's not how you do it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4743s)

No, absolutely. Yeah, I was thinking it was, it's very, it was, he was very territorial in his like demeanor that, "I've come out to get rid of this threat, this is my territory, how dare you?" That sort of stance is that, is what I was reading into it. But that again, that's only my opinion. Yeah, no, I think you're [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4773s) right. But if you boil it down, what was actually happening was he was the guy, and I'm referring to Lance, wanting to talk to him or his father about, I said disagreement, but just about things relating to the Brethren, relating to the church, and his own family.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD4GlKw6ArCU%26t%3D4790s)

And his own family, absolutely. The family Lance can't see.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4796s)

And same with me, like these people control what my family do or don't do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4802s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4802s)

Like he's just got to say a word and they'll be calling me like that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4805s)

Yeah. And if you explained that to most anybody, any outsider who hadn't heard of the Brethren or didn't know about them, they would not think, unless Lance had gone in there with a gun or something, you know, obvious aggression, which we know he didn't, I mean that's, yeah, yeah, they would think that's quite reasonable that he should try and talk to the person that's actually stopping him seeing his family and all of us seeing our families as it [happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4835s). But in this case, because it was Lance that goes, you would think that's quite a reasonable thing to do.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4841s)

Following John Hales' advice on how to say, "Go to the top."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4845s)

Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what you're doing. And yeah, we all know that, you know, the one word from the top would make our families contact us again. If that word came from the top that it's okay to go and have a cup of tea with your dad or your mom or your son or your mother, they would do it in a shot, wouldn't they?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4868s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4870s)

Yeah, they would. So, but ultimately, it's like the CEO of the company, the responsibility does lie there, doesn't it? With stopping this hurt and harm. But no, a very interesting encounter, Rowan, very interesting. Was there anything else you wanted to sort of get across or say regarding that or about things in general?

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4898s)

I was going to, I was going to, it did remind me of another amusing incident. So Lance wanted to deliver, on a previous occasion, Lance wanted to deliver a letter or try and speak to the Hales or something. And I took, I took him around there. And we, like I can't remember exactly what happened, excuse me, we rang the bell or something. Like there's a huge security fence all around, like a massive place. Might have rung the bell and no reply. And then I said, "Let's, let's have a walk around the block," because I'd heard once while I was in the Brethren about some secret tunnel under the back to get to, has anyone else heard that story?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4948s)

When the opposers knock on the door? No.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4956s)

It was at the time like when the press used to go around there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4960s)

Oh yeah, yeah, okay.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4964s)

I think at one stage, we like had press, something outside trying to get photos.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4967s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4968s)

And there was a story circulating in the Brethren, which I don't really believe, but maybe they said there was a tunnel under the back, he could go to one of his son's houses or something like that. Okay, all right, let's walk around the block and see if there's any house like, run through with any kind of manner or means. And I couldn't see any house where that could be the case. And so, but when we went around and came back, and then there was still [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=4999s) sign of life there. But then I saw something appearing up behind a pillar because they've got like these pillars and the gates. I saw someone there and I went over and I said, "Oh, hello." And it was a security guard. Right. And he didn't say anything for a while. He looked like he was fumbling with something on his belt, maybe. And I thought afterwards he was probably turning on a recorder.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5029s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5032s)

Expecting, I don't know. Like it seemed funny that he was quiet and then all of a sudden he started to talk. But he, like he was very quite nervous. And I said, "Oh, we're looking for Bruce Hales. It's Bruce Hales' house?" Like this is just words from memory, probably went through word to word. And he said, "No, I've never heard of him." So, "Oh, yeah, all right. You sure this is Bruce Hales' house?" "No, no, this is my brother's house," he said. "Wow, oh, your brother's house, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5062s) right."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5065s)

Wow.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5066s)

All right, security guard, knew I wasn't at all. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5070s)

Yeah.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5072s)

Yeah, I think there's something about, you know, just give a message to your brother.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5083s)

How funny, how funny. Yeah, our brother, good one, Ross. But it's interesting, isn't it? Because, you know, again, going back to the sort of bullying theme, the one thing they say you should do is actually call a bully out and go and talk to them and say, "Why are you treating me like this?" And if you think about it in the playground tactics, that's what you try to help children to do if they're being bullied, with support, to actually say to the children, "Stop treating me like this," and to build up their own, empower them and build up their own strength. And I suppose essentially that's what Lance was trying to do. And it takes courage to do that. I'm not sure I'd have the guts to do it, to be honest. But essentially that's, there's no harm intent. What he's trying to do is call that bullying behavior out in order to see his wife and kids again.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5145s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5147s)

Um, but then like that's...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5150s)

I think that's why, I think that's why they're so scared of him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5154s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what's interesting is the lengths that the Hales appear to go to to keep themselves hidden, you know, the security guards, the gates.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5169s)

Don't they have all the houses blocked out on Google Maps, don't they?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5174s)

Do they really? Yes, I've heard that, Ross. Yeah, yeah. And yet the threat they've got, for anyone inside the Brethren listening that thinks we're all opposed to Bruce Hales, the threat they've got is not physical at all. We just want to see our families. We just want to stop them hurting. That is the same time and again, the only thing, and there's no threat at all, is there? We'd just like to talk to them and say, "Why are you doing this?"

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5205s)

No, no. I mean, there's no threat to their lives like we were told. No, you know, we used to be told about why Bruce Hales had to have his own bodyguard. And that isn't what we're wanting. No, there's nothing, no, no.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5219s)

No, there isn't. I imagine it's more the bodyguards are there to stop people brave enough to call him out talking to him. It's not, no, no, not as a protection for his life.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5233s)

No, I mean, this is only my opinion, but I think it's also because he's so grandiose and thinks he's so great that's why he has, you know, he has these bodyguards to make him look, well, untouchable, really.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5246s)

Yeah, and it causes more fear amongst the members.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5251s)

They say that one of the features of a cult is the perceived enemy without. And you know, it's like the Berlin Wall, it wasn't there to stop people going in, it's to stop people coming out. And it's to build that perceived, "We're all safe in here, we're all okay," because out there, there's a big bad monster, which is exactly what the Brethren do, isn't it? But it's perceptions, it's so far from the reality.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5280s)

Yeah. It's so far from the truth. Yeah, yeah, so far. And you talk, you know, you talk, Rowan, about friends, you know, and I think that's another thing that we've noticed in these podcasts, how kind people in the outside world have been to us.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5296s)

I know it. Like remember what used to be a big thing that Brethren were proud of that, you know, we can go anywhere in the world and we stay with friends. You know, or you have to stay where you're told.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5311s)

But...

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5316s)

I worked in China for a couple of years since leaving the Brethren and you can honestly, like I know people there that have gone anywhere and just stayed with people I've just met. Like you can do it anyway, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5328s)

Yeah, they're not unique there, they're not unique at all. No, no, not at all. And again, that's a message to get across to anyone inside, everything that's in the Brethren, good and bad, is also out here. But focus on the good, focus on the good. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5347s)

Yeah, but there's so much, so much, sorry, there's so much unconditional love is shown, yes, to those of us, you know, who have found ourselves sometimes in difficult situations after leaving. And it's just, yeah, the love of people.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5364s)

What's it going to say about that? And you know, you're told in there, you know, everybody out here, if they give you something, they want something in return. But as you say, there's so many people, it's just so unconditional.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5376s)

Yeah, yeah. Well Rowan, thank you so much for coming on, sharing your story. And the insight into your incident of three years ago is quite fascinating. I'm sure it'll be talked about again. We will ask, we will put the link to the article in The Age newspaper in with this podcast when it's broadcast so people want to read through what happened and then hear Rowan's story behind it, they can do so and [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GlKw6ArCU&t=5406s) the video again. And I think the moral is next time you go round to the Hales' road, dress up a bit first, right? Just remember who you're visiting. Yeah, you're visiting royalty. Yeah, you're visiting royalty. So don't come straight from the boat. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. I'll stop the recording now.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
