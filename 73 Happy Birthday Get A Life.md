## Summary

It’s a blast from the past as the original founding podcast team of Cheryl, Carman, Lane, and Richard get together to celebrate Get-a-Life’s first birthday. Reviewing our year of podcasts, we realized that almost every aspect of the PBCC that we looked at involved the mistreatment and humiliation of women – so we made this today’s theme.
We look at how women and girls are controlled and oppressed in the PBCC under the pretense of “following scriptural principles” and show how women even in bible times were accorded much greater respect, power and opportunity than they are under Bruce Hales’ regime.
We trace back this distain and male entitlement to the extensive physical abuse meted out on numerous Brethren women by the so called “Elect Vessel” James Taylor Jr, and have some shocking eye-witness accounts of his predatory and disgusting behavior.
On a more positive note, we reveal the stunning statistics that show the incredible number of views from all over the globe that Get-a-Life has received and give the top 5 cities around the world for views.
A big thank you to ALL our viewers and our message to Bruce – if you think we are running short of ammo, think again. We are just getting started! Our goal will always be to save our families in there, from your doctrine.
A HUGE THANK YOU to James DiFiore for making this movement possible! Every ex-member thanks you.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=15s)

Welcome back, everyone. Today marks our one-year anniversary from when we started this podcast and we have come a long way. Our original first YouTube podcast that went out was October 13th, and this year it lands on Friday, October 13th for us here in Canada and the United States. So we're going to run through the statistics on how well our podcast has done and [globally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=45s) how far it has reached. So welcome and celebrate with us.

One of the main things that we want to focus on today is we're going to take you on a journey of one of the PBCC's biggest foundational flaws, which is their mistreatment of women and how their hierarchy places the women at the bottom of the totem pole. So we're going to walk you through this, but first I want to go through and share some of the statistics [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=75s) I pulled up from our analytics from our podcast.

I want to share that we have had over 1 million impressions on our podcast and almost 40,000 watch time hours. So that's huge for some, we didn't really know what we were doing. We threw ourselves in this. We are no professionals by any means. We came in this very authentically and organically with just wanting to [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=105s) a safe space for survivors to come on and tell their story.

We have created over 70 podcasts now and have still some in the vault to go out. We are very, very, very thankful for all of the survivors and ex-members, and professional help that has come on here to spread our message and spread the word of what really goes on inside the [PBCC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=136s) And I am so grateful of the team that has followed me. So thank you, Lane. Thank you, Richard. And thank you, Carman. And to our UK team that came on board, we were so grateful for that help. Our help from Ben, help me out here, guys.

We've had so much help with this in behind the scenes. Even though there's a lot of faces that haven't been shown up front, we have a ton of people helping us in behind. [Ex-members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=166s) that prefer to stay in behind the scenes, which is fine. To all of our moles, hiding inside, we could not do this without you. When we open up our inbox and it's filled with 20-30 emails from you multiple times during the week, some giving us information, we get a lot of information from you.

But a lot of you are giving us the information that the things that we provide to you on the podcast you've never even heard about yet. So it works both ways where I know so many of you wait weekly for those podcasts to come out so that you can find out what's actually going on inside where you are. And to a lot of the people who take the [chances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=215s) to give us information and to record the information, we really appreciate it.

I want to reiterate that this movement was never about bashing the PBCC or sitting there trying to take Bruce Hales down. This movement was about opening up a platform for survivors to come on, tell their stories, but to also get the coverage we needed to allow the media, to allow journalists, to allow the police, to allow social services, to allow all those other government agencies to know what was really going on inside there. Because it's not right, it still is not right.

And just [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=272s) the FLDS, it took a movement to get to where they were, just like the Jehovah Witnesses. It took a movement to get to where they got to. So we're all working at this together to create a safe space, a mainstream Christian church for our families that are left in there to stay safe in. So even though it takes a lot of exposing and unraveling Bruce Hales and his thinking, his [rules,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=303s) and the way that he portrays what he is doing inside there, it may look to people that that's what we sit here and do, but it's not.

We have a larger goal at the end of this tunnel, and that is to create a safe space for people to grow up in, because what it is now is not a safe space, especially for women and especially for children. I am not negating the men that are inside that they are abused and that go through a lot of things. But for [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=333s) personally, it is about the females inside there and it is about keeping the children safe.

So I want to tell you the top five locations that our podcasts have reached. So we have two platforms that we put our podcasts out to. One is on the audio versions, although Spotify does have video too. So we have an anchor platform that pushes it out to Spotify and Apple and Google, all those other different platforms. And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=363s) we have our YouTube. So we have two different platforms that we come off of.

So our anchor platform, our top five locations through the anchor platform, number one was Australia. Number two was UK. Number three was Canada. Number four was United States and number five was New Zealand. And on the YouTube side of things, UK was number one, Australia was number two, Canada was number three, United States was number four, and New Zealand was number five. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=394s) the female definitely wins the demographic for watching these. So I assume we know that it's a lot of our viewers come from inside. And I suppose it's the mom sitting at home trying to figure out how they're going to get out of this mess. That's just my assumption.

So for the cities, our top five cities. So this is going to blow some people away. The first four aren't going to, but the fifth one is. So the number one city, [obviously,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=424s) no surprise, Sydney, Australia. We know that that's where our number one comes from on all angles is Sydney. Our number two was London. Number three was Melbourne. Number four was Perth. And number five was Calgary, Alberta. So Richard and I talked about this earlier because I was just shocked. Richard, you have a good explanation of why it might be Calgary.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=455s)

Well, it's just speculation. But obviously the PBCC has some kind of organization that monitors all the publicity and monitors all the opposers as they call them. You know, they're the people who hire the private investigators who do the rebuttals and they will have an office and representatives in each country where the brethren are to monitor the local situation. And I just wondered if the, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=485s) the poor peeb guy who has to monitor all our stuff is a brother from Calgary. So if it is, you know, have a good day and I hope you enjoy our content.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=499s)

Well I think it's exposed possibly, well, two things possibly here. One, these statistics might have exposed the brethren's listening station, or where they monitor, right? And my second thing that jumps to mind with Calgary is, isn't that where the famous brethren lawyer Gerald Chipeur is from?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=525s)

Well that is true, that is true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. 

**Carman Drever**

Speaking of monitoring, I gotta tell you guys a really funny story. You know the whole Palmerston North podcast that we just put out? Through all of our Facebook posts and our podcasts, we came up with this really catchy name for the situation in Palmerston North. And that was the Palmy Party. Well, I had an insider from the UK tell me yesterday [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=556s) even as far as the Front Row Brothers that refer to the occasion in Palmy, they refer to it as the Palmy Party. So that tells you how many insiders are watching. They've even accepted our branded name. And he said it was so amazing on a parking lot in the UK to hear a front row brother refer to the Palmerston North meetings as the Palmy party.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=586s)

That just gave me a question in my mind. Do you think the brethren are terrified to say the phrase "Get-A-Life" now?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=598s)

I don't know. The thing I got, this one million impressions, I mean that's a hell of a lot more impressions than you get for one of Bruce's white books, isn't it?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=615s)

Oh, they loved that term, didn't they? I remember always being asked when I was a kid, "Did you get an impression at the Lord's supper?" which is their Sunday morning communion. And my usual impression was, because it was 6 a.m., was extreme tiredness and lack of attention and desire to leave were my deepest impressions.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=642s)

Oh, that's hilarious. You know what will be the interesting thing is when we finally get our merchandise out there with Get-A-Life on it and you know, start seeing the people inside there silently wearing our Get-A-Life hoodies.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=656s)

Yes, and if we have people that want to assist us in that or have contacts in, you know, T-shirt design and things like that, please contact us.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=668s)

Yeah, and all proceeds will go to, yeah, proceeds will go to the charity once it gets up and going. So, yeah. So I want to also go over our top five episodes through both ways that we put our podcasts out. The one being the one Anchor, which puts it up to all the audio ones, and then our YouTube. So on anchor, our top five podcasts, the first number one is our very first episode, which is "Who are the PBCC?". Number two was "The Klondike Papers," [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=699s) was episode number two.

Number three was episode 44 with Cassie Davies, which we all know had a huge, huge, that one rocked the boat and she now has her own podcast coming out. Episode one was just released, so if you haven't checked that out, make sure you go and check out Cassie Davies' podcast. Number four was episode six with Christine from New Zealand. It was New Zealand, right? Yep. Yeah, uh, working for the PBCC. So that one made me very happy to see that it was up there. So that makes me realize that they're taking that serious.

People are searching that and when they're looking for a podcast to relate to with where they're working, that one obviously comes up. And then number five through Anchor was episode 36 with Ben Woodbury, which we knew again, also the views were there very, very fast. And through YouTube, our number one episode was episode one again, "Who are the [PBCC?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=760s)” Number two was Cassie. Number three was Abi which again, another series of podcasts that had a ton of information that really rocked the foundation inside the Plymouth Brethren. Number four was Ben Woodbury and number five was Beth Seed. And again, that was another really, really intense podcast with a lot of abuse that had happened in it.

So those were our top five podcasts on both sides. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=791s) really proud of us for the amount of time and effort that goes into this because it's not just the podcast. This is hours upon hours upon hours of responding to emails, having conversations. I mean, there are some days whereby I shut my phone off now, just so people know. I do shut my phone off now at 11 p.m. and I try not to touch it till 6 a.m. So I specifically give myself that time only because the people that are on a different time zone, that's when a lot of stuff comes into us from the other side of the country.

But there's days [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=835s) my poor husband, I mean, we are, we're like 6 a.m. and it goes. And I know Carman can contest to this where sometimes she does an all-nighter. I don't cut those out now because I need my sleep for my day job. And but the amount of time and effort that goes into this a year later, even though we have had moments of, it's a roller coaster. We all four of us know what a roller coaster this can be, right? It triggers us. It pulls up wounds and trauma that we've never dealt with.

The other day I was just talking to you guys and I felt it, it felt like a million-pound magnet came over my body after the Chicago stuff went down and just pulled it to the surface. So I'm a runner. So it is part, there's often [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=891s) when I'm just like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm out." Right? But it's because it's so intense. And then my team around me always rallies, pulls me back up and reminds us why we do this. And so for that, I am super, super proud of ourselves.

For a year later, I woke up three or four days ago with just fires lit. I am lit. I'm back on. It feels like there's [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=922s) wood in these fires than ever before. And I feel that we're starting off this second year with twice as much fuel that we had in the first year and three times the amount of help coming our way now. People reaching out all the time now, "What can I do to help? I want to help. What is that? What do you guys need help with?" So I think starting year two, year two is going to be far more productive than we had in year [one,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=952s) and year one was very, very productive. So I just think, I'm just proud of us. I'm really, really proud of how far we've come.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=960s)

And I would say that, yeah, it is a great team, not taking away from that at all. But this was Cheryl's idea. I remember it as clear as daylight. We were having this conversation and Cheryl says to me, "We need to start our own podcast." 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=980s)

And I said, Yes. But then we had the phrase behind the name when Richard just sent us the logo and I'm like, "Well, that's perfect. That's really what we're all trying to attain here." We're all trying to attain how to get a life. We're trying to gain our life back, right? So it kind of all came together. And then I was like, I had already, Lane had reached out to me and I really, really clicked with Lane. I was like, I felt just as I had felt that a brother [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1012s) back into my life.

And I was like, "Okay, well, Lane, we're doing..." and then I was like, "Okay, well, we need a Symington on here. We've got to, in order to have them take us seriously, let's call Carman and see if Carman will come on here." And Carman was all over it. And then it just grew, right? It really, it really took off.

This year, there's a lot of subjects that we haven't covered yet that we intend to cover. We are going to dive into the RRT. That is something that is very much been on the forefront for a long time for us as we've been collecting information. It is a lot to cover. There is a lot of irons in the fire. There really is. We have a lot of fires burning. So be patient with us. We have some very... A lot of fires burning and not a lot of fire extinguishers. Yeah.

And we have some recent leavers that have been very keen in helping support our ideas. And you know who you are. You know who we're talking about. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know some of you, I know particularly one stays up to all hours of the night sending us stuff. So we really appreciate that help. When we have this idea, we know that there's a subject that we need to be presenting. [RRT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1111s) is one of the hugest things that we have coming at us that we know we need to. I know the UK team is going to be doing podcasts on alcoholism. There's a lot of subjects that are going to come forward that we know that we are going to dive into. And we're really excited to collaborate with those and get those out to you.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1136s)

In the year that we've done this, right, we've already helped people leave, right? Helped them have a place to come and talk to others, right? And to hear stories that kind of confirmed their own and that they knew that they weren't alone. And you know, I've had some of these people that have recently left literally say, "Your podcast, the podcast you guys are doing, helped us leave, helped us change our [minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1166s) and see through the curtain and realize that we were being lied to and realize that we didn't believe in this crap with Bruce Hales being some special guy."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1178s)

I was gonna say that that is, that is really, I think the biggest thing that we have given and provided for them to see inside there is they have choices. I don't think they realized that the ex-brethren community was as collaborative as it was, right? And having Lindy come forward and launch the Olive Leaf Network in New Zealand, now in Australia, we have Canada and US [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1208s) being built right now.

It's the platform for people to walk out of there into something else is huge. The resources are really, really available, right? And I think those resources have to be this readily available out here because how Bruce has things inside there when it comes to leaving a business, leaving a family is much harder than when we had to leave. We didn't have the resources to go out to, but it was easier for us to leave. Now [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1241s) kind of flipped where it's much harder to leave in there. There's a lot of mental game and emotional games they've got to get through in order to see, but there's a huge wealth of resources and landing pads that are provided on the outside now.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1257s)

Most important audience are the people who are still in there. Those are the people I think about every time I go on a podcast, every time I publish something on Facebook, I'm talking to you. You're the people I'm concerned about. Yes, it's very interesting and it's healing. It's therapeutic for ex-brethren. It's a great resource for journalists. But really, the people we're speaking to are the people who are still trapped in there because we understand. [We've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1287s) been where you are now and we just want you to get free in the same way that we've got free. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1293s)

And I know Carman's working on a new project right now where she is going. So you're going to have to email her at info.getalife@proton.me. We're not going to tell you where we're putting these for people's sakes, but there will be access more readily available and easily for those inside that if you have a UBT device, we are making our podcasts more readily available so that you can watch these on a UBT device. So you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1323s) email Carman. I just realized I don't have my info.getalife@proton.me underneath my name, but or email us at our regular group email so that you can get that information and we'll let you know when it is available. But there is a means coming where you can watch these podcasts on a UBT device.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1343s)

Yeah, so you'll be able to download it and share it within the brethren and WhatsApp network. And so, you know, it takes away the necessity for having a non-Brethren device or running off to the library. But I guess we will, once we've got that up and set up, then we'll be spreading that information around. So that's something to look forward to.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1366s)

I watched recently, I saw a PBCC, a Brethren, put out a video of a young girl telling how amazing her life was in the church, a young Jamaican girl. And I saw this, and I found it really interesting, because it kind of shows the power of brainwashing in a way, right? She was happy. She did like her life.

She's like, "Yes, my day consists, you know, getting ready for school, going to school. And then after school, I like to sing. So we do singing. And then we hang out with friends." And there's a picture of her sitting like on a picnic table with friends, "and then we do some singing and then we hang out and we sit." And then it's like sitting at a park bench, "and then we sing and then we hang out and we sing and we hang up." And that was it, right? And it was the brethren PR video [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1424s) like, "Look how happy and amazing our children are."

But if you really look at it, you'll see that it's, yes, it doesn't mean that these children are not happy, but they, that is all they know. They clearly don't know that there is more to life than the simple things that they're being told makes them happy, right? It really denied the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1445s)

Choice. They are denied the choice of what some of those kids could grow up, go to university and be, like I've said this before, our next huge scientist in there that could find a cure to cancer or find a cure to something could be sitting inside the PBCC and not get to access that. Yeah, and especially the females, right? Like especially those females in there that they don't, I mean, sure she showed that she was happy, but the poor girl [doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1475s) get to fulfill any other desires other than becoming a wife and having children. And they can say as much as they want to say in there about, "Oh, that they have important job titles and they have this and they have that." These females are still sitting on the back rows of those churches and those females still have no say when it comes to their faith.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1498s)

Whether they're happy in 10 years time when she's got four young children, an alcoholic husband, trying to run the local Campus\&Co store, that's really the question, isn't it? Yeah, that's a good point.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1514s)

And it's, you know, how do I say this, but the opportunities are just not given to the females at all, the women in the church, right? At least the men have some opportunity where they're pushed into business and creating their own businesses or working for a big business, right? And they're just pushed more into business and being successful in that. And the women in the Brethren have nothing [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1544s) to look forward to being a mother, right? And volunteering their time at Campus\&Co.

And I'm not religious, but when I think about it, why would the creator only have that in mind for them? If he loves everyone equally, he doesn't have any more inspiration. He has a plan for everyone, apparently, but no further plan than motherhood for the women in the Plymouth Brethren. That's it. That's the, you know what I mean? Like he doesn't have like, "Oh, you're going to go do this, you're going to become a doctor, you'll become a lawyer or [scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1574s) or nothing." It's just they have one path. Why? Why is that? It doesn't seem reasonable or sensible to me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1581s)

I mean, even an animal with its natural instincts will make a very good mother. You don't need intelligence because it's an instinctive thing. And the fact that women are not allowed to speak or be in any administrative position is really saying to them, "You're just a childcare and breeding facility. We don't value your brain. We do not [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1612s) to hear your opinion. Your knowledge, your wisdom on any subject is of no interest to us. You know, cook, iron, wash, produce babies and feed them." I mean, they're really, they're just reduced to the level of animals. That that's really what it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1634s)

Yep. We have, Carman actually has done up an incredible slideshow that I want to take us through. Let's go into this. So I'm going to let you go through this, Carman, and explain what you have set up here.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1653s)

So basically, what I did was looked for the top 10 reasons that domestic violence in women is such a huge problem. And in going through all the different studies, Oxfam was a very comprehensive study. It studied 19 different countries, which included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the UK. So it included all the countries that brethren are a huge, you know, concentrated in. But it also included a lot of Muslim [countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1696s)

And you might say, "Well, so why would you choose something that contains Muslim countries?" And the thought process behind that is those countries are very similar to brethren in that they're very high control, male dominant groups. And so it seemed like a good mix to add in. So that's the theory about why we chose this study. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1726s) the first reason that domestic violence continues and is such a big problem is that women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life.

This has been commented on in a number of different podcasts and notably from the OneSchool Global admins that we've talked to. And one of the things that they always comment on is submissiveness [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1756s) gender appears in the teens and the young married couples and for the rest of a PBCC woman's life. And we can prove that because we have a quote down here from Bruce D. Hales, and this is a quote where he has said, 

"Being subject to their own husbands, it would be that wives have come under the authority of Christ and he has gained their heart. So there's an influence, the divine center has secured a place [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1786s) our affections so that subjection is not being held out as being a difficult thing."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1794s)

So in other words, like they just continually preach to subject yourself, right? And I remember even hearing that as a kid, "Subject yourself to God, subject yourself to the man of God," which is Bruce Hales, "and subject yourself to the assembly," which is this made-up thing in your imagination that exists in the church, "and subject yourself to the truth," right? It's all subjection. And the "subject yourself to man" [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1824s) the big one to all women in the church. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1827s)

Yeah. The number one biggest one was; Women must be submissive to their husbands.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1835s)

Yes. And that's where we hear a lot of these domestic violence reports, right? Come to their, every single one of their stories is they knew that they had to be submissive. They knew that they had to give their husband what he wanted when he wanted it. And you couldn't say no. So I'm not saying every relationship inside the PBCC is like that, but there is a high amount of that in there [due](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1866s) to men thinking that they own their wife. And we just recently had a post on Facebook of an anonymous person who had been in a relationship with an ex-member who was male that had shown this authority still, and they were separating over it from what I gathered from the comments and stuff that that's what was happening.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1890s)

Yeah, and the important thing for people to realize is to be submissive is to offer a certain amount of respect. And yes, there is teaching that wives need to be submissive to their husbands, but the end part of that teaching is "as Christ is to the assembly." So yes, there's that thing about being submissive, but in order to be submissive, it's sort of like [respect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1921s) It's earned. And the important thing to realize is husbands and wives are actually equal. There's things that husbands do that wives don't do, and there's things that wives do that husbands don't do. But God never meant us to be anything less than equal partners in bringing up a household. And that is something that the PBCC has missed and tossed under the carpet, notably, I'm sure, to have better control.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1950s)

Men are expected to exercise coercive control. 

“We want to exercise that in our families so that if they get in our company, they come under our control because of our spirits, because we have pure minds and we've got pure hearts and we've got pure motives and that's the influence that keeps the devil out." 

Whoo. What do they want to exercise in their families? The coercive control. That's what they're saying is they need to exercise control over their, coercive control over their families. And they want that to get it into their companies. That is something that if you said that in public, right, like to normal people...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1996s)

Especially nowadays.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=1998s)

Yeah, they would leave that business conference. You know, if so, the brethren have to operate in a cult-like environment. They are a cult because if they said those things, right, that are in their white books and all the ministry that they put out, if they put these things out to the public, people would be in an absolute uproar and go, "You guys are absolutely abusive and should be abolished because of the things that you preach: hate. You preach hate and control."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2026s)

Yeah, this is a good point here too, Carman, that you wrote in here. There's tremendous amounts of pressure put on men to control their wives in the PBCC. The women are not viewed as equal partners in a marriage, but instead of a lesser person in need of control. And I mean, that goes right down to even their wearing of their ribbons and stuff, that they need that extra protection. So this is the third one. 

Men have the right to discipline women for incorrect behavior.

Oxfam in their study reveals that there is a strong belief among both women and men that violence is acceptable and even necessary when used by men to discipline women for not delivering on their perceived responsibilities or when their behaviors transgress as social norms.

So this is a quote from Bruce.

 "Even in the training of a family and getting a family organized in the right way in regard of the assembly, there's an aspect of what's military that can't be overlooked." 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2090s)

Oh boy, oh boy, are you wrong there, Bruce. Sorry.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2093s)

Like, could you imagine? Could you imagine going to, I'm just going to put this out, you're going to a Sunday church service, say at your local Baptist church with, you know, 3,000 people, it's a big Baptist church, and this quote gets read out into it? What I think would happen, I guarantee...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2123s)

But what, like my question is, what the does Bruce Hales know about the military? I'm sorry, I still don't think he can do a push-up, right? "There's an aspect of what's military that can't be overlooked." Are you speaking from experience, Brucie? Because last I heard, you were an accountant. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2142s)

Not to mention coming from a cult that have been non-combatants in both world wars. It's a little rich. But it is, yeah. So the Oxfam survey, point number four of the causes of domestic violence is that sexual harassment is normal. And it says dominant patterns around male sexual entitlement over women's bodies contribute to sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence.

 In the Oxfam study, a young woman stated, "I believe that everything arises from the fact that men see us as sexual objects and as persons that they need to fill their sexual needs."

And then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2188s) is a really amazing quote from Bruce Hales.

 "Wives are great stuff, great stuff when they know where they fit. Absolutely priceless. Was it FER said? It provides a, it's a provision or it's like a provision or a facility for the enjoyment of eternal life."

 So I don't know how low you can go, Bruce, but to refer to your wife as a facility for enjoyment, I mean, you wouldn't even call your dog that....

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2225s)

So this one makes me so angry. This one just like boils my blood. And this is 2007\. This is like...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2236s)

Yeah. A facility for the enjoyment of eternal life. That will get you a whole night in the goat barn and no supper for at least a week. It shows the ignorance. It shows the ignorance.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2252s)

And I want our listeners and viewers to remember this point of number four for a video clip we're going to show you later on. I just want you to remember this because this, when they talk about Aberdeen not happening, and then we have this being said in ministry in 2007, and then we have testimony of a video that we're going to show you later on, is [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2282s) want, I just hope that the people inside there can realize that yes, Aberdeen happened.

Yes, if you look with a microscope through all the ministry and through his quotes and through things that people have said out here that you can put all those pieces together and realize, "Yeah, I need to get the hell out of here." That this is a business that promotes extreme sexual misconduct in every part of the sector that it can go [around.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2313s) And when I mean sexual misconduct, I mean misconduct in every way, shape, or form: pedophilia, domestic violence, covering it all up, right? Like it's... walking through what, when I was reading what you wrote in here, Carman, I was like, what a breeding ground. What a breeding ground for such horrific, horrific abuse.

And if you are a female, a wife, someone who's not married, and you have children, you need to get the hell out of there. That's all I have to say. And I hope that this podcast, when you look through it, you start figuring out a way that this might be possible.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2362s)

And for the outsiders, imagine how sad it is to not be able to divorce a man that says, "Yeah, they're good stuff when they know where they fit," right? And they don't even have the option to divorce. I mean, they can if they really wanted to, but they don't even know how.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2384s)

So number five in the Oxfam study of reasons that domestic violence continues: Women experience violence because they are dressed provocatively. Among the countries involved in this study, it is common to see communities blaming the actions of women to justify male sexual entitlement and violence. 

Victim shaming is a coward's way. If someone dressed up as a cow, are they asking to be made into [hamburger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2414s) patties for the next barbecue? Of course not. It's a simple matter of self-control and self-responsibility, both of which are not found very often in the males in the PBCC.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2428s)

When you listen to this video that we're going to play later, again, I want you to remember this quote. I want you to remember this topic because they don't, it's just disgusting at how vulgar the language is when it comes to the men, the teens, the amount of things that have been plopped on our lap that just recently people have overheard people talking about women and about, it's just, it's [horrific.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2458s) It's absolutely horrific that this shit gets covered up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2461s)

Yeah, and even like male students in OneSchool Global talking to and about their female teachers. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2471s)

Number six: All women should become mothers. Wow. Violence against women and girls is rooted in the patriarchal power imbalance between men and women in the dominant belief that men protect and provide for and have authority over their family and good women prioritize their family's health and well-being. This is Bruce Hales' quote:

 "It's very attractive when the younger [young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2501s) women attached to their husbands, attached to their children, diligent in homework, they are attached to the family position and committed to it and diligent in it." 

This is just makes your stomach turn, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2516s)

Just feel like we're back in like the early 1900s when, you know, women's rights haven't come in yet. And that's what this feels like we're fighting for. I feel like we are fighting for the women's rights inside the PBCC right now.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2530s)

Absolutely.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2531s)

Yeah, and it's "prioritize their family's health and well-being," right? Like it's like they're, like I remember hearing the words about the woman's duty, the wife's duty in the church, right? And it was like, what is this duty? It was kind of, you know, just assumed is to stay at home, make babies, that's her duty, and make sure that he's happy and you have those [meals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2561s) ready for him when he comes home because otherwise they can, they have authority over you, so who knows.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2567s)

Of course, another interesting point here is that in the PBCC, it's very important that women become mothers because no one for sure, no one is going to join that bunch. So all of their members, they have to breed them. It's a captive breeding program. And it makes them very unique in the, you know, maybe ultra-Orthodox Jews possibly. But I mean, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, they are very extensive in recruiting new [members.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2598s) In the PBCC, they're absolutely dependent on all these big families, on the children, because that's the next generation of people for the elect vessel to exploit. They need them to work in their factories.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2611s)

Because you can't get people to join, because convincing an adult of these awful rules and teachings that they have, no normal, capable thinking adult would want to join that. That's why they can't recruit and they have to procreate.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2631s)

Exactly. Of course, the other issue that comes up is, you know, it's lovely to have children in a controlled way. But I mean, think of these brethren families where, I mean, take my own ex-mother-in-law, for example. She had 11 pregnancies, she had 10 children, she had extremely high blood pressure and was on a heavy dose of antidepressants and alcohol and suddenly [dropped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2661s) dead before she was 60\.

You know, I mean, and that's not an uncommon story in the brethren. I mean, some people, you know, want to have a very large family, but, you know, most people would prefer to, you know, have a manageable two, three children well spaced out. That that's not an option. I mean, reproductive rights are non-existent in there, completely non-existent.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2692s)

For a long time they didn't allow birth control, isn't that, isn't that right? And then...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2699s)

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as far as I know, that's, oh yeah, we know a lot of people do use birth control, but as far as I know, you still get in trouble if you're found out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2708s)

Yeah, it's done behind the scenes. Yeah, it's totally done. It's not, they still don't allow it. It's just done behind the scenes. Yeah. So this is point number seven of this study: Girls are valued as wives, not as individuals. Oxfam noted for girls, the social expectation to demonstrate submissiveness can lead to early marriage, which is also used to control their sexuality.

And this is especially noted in the frequent guests that have spoken of the threats hurled at them in choosing a path free from PBCC control: "You will be pregnant and unmarried in a matter of months. Your daughters will lose their purity immediately upon leaving." So this is something that is very much thrown in the faces of the females if you do want to leave, right? They do put those out there. Yet we have this exact same thing happening in there.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2763s) mean, I get so angry at the hypocrisy of some of these statements that they throw out there because how females, how people are in there, I would love to know the actual account of how many people have been sexually abused in there or been sexually violated, right? Let's just start with that, just sexually violated in their early years and then into their teens.

I have this theory that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2793s) reason why Bruce is so hell-bent on bringing up Aberdeen and trying to make sure that this next generation doesn't believe that Aberdeen is true is because if this next generation was to truly dive into Aberdeen and see it for what it was, along with everything that we're exposing, I think he knows that he would lose a lot of people or a lot of people would start talking about the sexual abuse they've gone through, the sexual violations that they've gone through.

I firmly, [firmly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2823s) believe that his point of doing this is that he does not want the sexual abuse uncovered that happened within JTJr.'s time and what JTJr., how he treated women, right? I don't think he wants them to know about it. I mean, it's the perfect way. He's got this new generation blindly following him, making him billions of dollars of cash coming at him. He doesn't want them finding out of one of the biggest cracks that this [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2853s) system has. It is Aberdeen. It is Aberdeen.

And we do hope to do an Aberdeen podcast on just the facts. We want to lay out all of the evidence that is put in black and white for every person that's in there to watch and make your own choice. That will be coming soon. But I think Bruce is really trying to cover his tracks on not letting especially the females in there [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2883s) see how it was, how it started way back then, and it's continuing on.

Because now it's just, now it's just an everyday thing, right? Women get treated like crap in there, but they just take it because to them it's just normal for them. It's absolutely normal for them. I mean, we hear of recent leavers when they find like an actual partner out here that's all, they don't know what to do with it. I mean, I didn't know what to do with it when my husband came along. I mean, this man loved me in a way that I had never witnessed before. I had never [witnessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2921s) that being taken care of like that. That was nothing in 17 years that had been in there had ever, ever seen. So I think he's got to create this narrative of what would happen to you out there. He's got to keep Aberdeen completely covered up so that these women can't see how absolutely demeaning of a place that they live in.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2949s)

I want to point out, I want to attack two little things here in that slide. First off, "You'll be pregnant and unmarried in a matter of months." Nothing illegal about that. Lots of people choose to be pregnant and unmarried. So that's just a sin thing in their mind, right? And then the other thing, "Your daughter will lose their purity immediately upon leaving." So what does that mean? Maybe their daughter will be at a Taylor Swift concert and kiss another 15-year-old and get their first kiss. That's [losing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2980s) their purity in the brethren, right? And that's these, these sins, they're terrible sins. It's a sin to be unmarried and have a child. Ah, but it's not. That's just a made-up thing. Anyway, that was my little rant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=2995s)

But it is true that the point about that what they consider losing their purity is like those are things that happen in the everyday world out here all the time with getting your first kiss at 15 or, and in my case in this, it makes me just sad because they're telling these to two people in there when I guarantee how many percentage of these people were violated by some old guy that shouldn't have had his hands where he had them. Yeah, again, look forward to the video we're going to show you. Really building up to this video because it's just, it's, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3035s)

Heterosexuality is the only sexual orientation that is acceptable. Discrimination and marginalization make some women and girls more likely to experience violence. This includes women and girls with disability, divorced women and widows, sex workers, and lesbian and trans women. And we know anything besides heterosexuality is a complete no-go in the PBCC as frequent guests [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3065s) proven over and over. Gay men are immediately thrown out of the brethren.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3073s)

I witnessed this hatred, right? I witnessed this as a child. It wasn't just teaching that it was wrong, they taught a hatred of it. I remember them speaking of a hatred of it. It was disgusting and traumatic the way that they talked about homosexuality in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. It really was traumatic, disgusting, and evil.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3099s)

They call it satanic, right? That's the words they use about it, that it's satanic. And I'm like, it's so old school, so old school. Again, we're fighting for these freedoms that out here in this world, we conquer. I mean, obviously right now in society, there's a lot of huge stuff going out in the LGBTQ community. Let's put that aside. But just the basic stepping out as a gay man, [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3130s) rights were won. Or a gay person. Those rights were won how many years ago, right?

Like it's just so, it's so cave-like in there. And that's what's so sad is that when you are born into this and you know nothing else but what you are born into, it's such a human right that is taken away from them. It is such a human right of them [taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3160s) away. The way that their phones are blocked, websites are blocked. These people can't, they can't research things about themselves. And that's why I am so happy that we were able to really pull off these podcasts and get them out there because so many people have felt validated.

Even though a lot of these people haven't left yet, there is hundreds of people in there one foot in, one foot out. And we know Bruce knows that. He knows his time is coming. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3192s) I do, I think a lot of those people who are closeted gay men and women that don't have a way to come out, having this validation and being able to know what it's called, being able to know that there's people that have left that have come out and are very successful, I think it's just very inspiring for them in there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3213s)

I mean, seeing as we're talking about women's rights, particularly, we haven't yet had anyone on the podcast who has been kicked out because of being a lesbian, but we do know that there are members of the ex-brethren community who have been mistreated and have been kicked out for that reason. And I'm sure there are lots and lots of people who are in that. I [mean,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3243s) to be a gay man in The Brethren is bad enough. To be a gay woman in The Brethren is even worse because you've got the whole kind of oppression and control thing about being a woman, and then you've got this hatred against gays on top of that. I mean, that's a really, really terrible situation to find yourself in.

Divorced women have less value. Oxfam notes, divorced women and widows face particular forms of violence because of discriminatory [beliefs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3274s) around the roles and value of women. Divorce was up until recently an absolute forbidden practice in the PBCC. In some situations where divorced because a spouse had left and remarried outside the PBCC, in the last 20 years the rules have relaxed a bit and these people have been allowed to remarry. Up to then it was completely forbidden.

So yeah, I mean, this is a big one, a big topic, because [divorce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3304s) is forbidden except in the sense that if you did go ahead with a divorce, one or other spouse would be kicked out. So women who are in a sort of domestic violence situation, they don't have the option of divorcing but remaining within the brethren. So if they do go ahead with a divorce, they will be excommunicated. And then, of course, they will lose their [children,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3335s) their parents, everyone they've ever known. So it's a huge discrimination and so people are trapped in these abusive relationships where, you know, outside in the world at large, yes, abusive relationships happen, but there is a legitimate and respectful way to escape it. But inside there, you know, people are trapped until, you know, it's a life sentence.

So, the other strange thing that happens with divorces in the PBCC is that if a husband leaves the brethren or is kicked out, the woman is then encouraged to divorce him or told to divorce him, even if she doesn't want to. And then the woman acquires this kind of strange status in there. They're called a "widow for the [truth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3395s) to sort of imply that this is a person who has chosen the fellowship over and against her own husband. And it actually gives them a kind of, you know, they're specially prayed for.

But they're also discriminated in the sense that it's said in the brethren that it's a great privilege to have the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion, as they call it, in your house. And when they have special occasions and a lot of brethren are staying in a particular congregation, they will hold Holy Communion in a number of the houses, in the brethren's houses, because they don't have enough meeting halls to do that. But if you're a widow for the truth, you can't have Holy [Communion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3442s) in your house because your household is incomplete. It's referred to as a broken household.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3449s)

Are you serious?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3451s)

I didn't even know that. That's totally true. Because we never, like, there was widows for the truth in my congregation and we never, ever had the Lord's Supper as they call it there. So I can attest to that. Wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3464s)

And widows especially, and we heard that last podcast that we did with Julie, her mom, her dad wasn't there. And so she was a widow for the truth. But widows too, their households are definitely discriminated against because that woman has no voice. So every decision that's made in the meeting, the brothers all have this chance to pick up the mic and add their 10 cents worth. If you lived, like [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3494s) you don't have a husband or don't have a male in the house, you get zero input into all the decisions. And you're always looked down on because, yeah, because there's not a man in the house. Yeah, that's very true.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3508s)

Number 10: Let's stop thinking it's normal. Every day and everywhere in this world, gender bias has become a normalized thing. Stop this. It is not normal and should never be viewed as such.

Jesus, in all his words and deeds, left us an example to treat women as equals with men, never subordinated or restricted in role. His treatment of women as equals defied the judicial, social, and religious customs of his day. On judicial matters where the women's rights were curtailed, such as regarding adultery and divorce, he treated men and women equally.

When will we start to see mainstream Christian churches start to model this behavior? Drop the gender biases and accept women as equal partners in marriage instead of inferiors? Yeah, I'll agree with that. I don't know. Personally, I think it's rooted in religion, some of these problems. But Jesus did preach equality and it's just not preached in the church. So it's just another example of them not [following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3581s) their own book that they love so much, that they, you know, say that their entire lives are guided by, that they're very proud of that fact, yet they do not follow it themselves. So I find that very interesting.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3596s)

You made an excellent, excellent comment, Lane, when you said it's rooted in religion. And actually, these behaviors are rooted in religion. And religion is organized religion. It's not Christianity. It is, they claim to be following the Bible and they claim to be Christianity, but they're not. They're an organized religion and they don't even always follow Christian principles. So you're exactly right. It is something that comes out of religion, and religion is nothing more than a proud group of people pretending to believe certain things, but their actions say otherwise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3648s)

Oh yes, this is, this was so good. So this is the inside of a meeting hall.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3656s)

That's a little triggering seeing that all of a sudden right on the screen. I'm like, whoa.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3662s)

So I'm like, is this, I have to ask you, Carman, is this actually what it looks like when Bruce Hales comes and sits down here? Is that his little water and stuff?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3672s)

I don't know that this is a picture that, it was in the Auckland meeting room. And from my understanding, he has actually had a mic stand, like you see that boom mic there, he's had a mic stand modified so that it holds his glass of water. So I doubt if it's on a little table like that. Glass of water, yeah, yeah, yeah. He also has, he has one for when he's sitting down and they've even modified one now so that if he stands up, he has a fresh glass of water when he stands up and it's right up there right beside where he's standing. Holy cow, that looks like a cooler sitting there. I mean, why would you have a cooler next to where Bruce Hales was sitting? I can't imagine.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3719s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3720s)

I don't know.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3721s)

Yeah, I just want to give the listeners a quick description of this, those who aren't viewing the video. So what we've got here is a picture of inside the church. They're in the center of the dish. So think square building with a dish on the inside and rows of seating and benches going down into the center dish. Circular, yeah. Yeah, circular. Sorry. And the leader sits in the center circle. And the women have to sit on the back rows, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3751s) and the men sit on the inner parts of the circles and it has to be separated. And it's really culty. Like if you look at this picture and you've never seen anything culty before, you do not see a church in this photo. You'd not see a cross on the wall or any kind of decoration or anything. It just looks like a cult building.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3771s)

It's very satanic looking. For anybody that has gone to a mainstream Christian church, and in Sevier County, there's probably 40 or 50 of them, all different kinds, Catholic, Lutheran, Evangelical, Protestant, whatever, almost every mainstream Christian church, families sit together. There's not this hierarchy in the seating. But the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church doesn't allow their members to [sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3801s) together as families. They pull their men out and stick them in the front rows, therefore to reinforce this family position where men are more important than women.

And the women sitting on the very back rows, what you would notice if you could get in there really close is there are no microphones back there. So the man sitting on the very front row there can take a meeting and he can be yelling at you and you're sitting on the very back row as a sister. And it will be [undeniably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3832s) about you because I've had this happen many times. The meeting, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the meeting was directed at you. But as a sister on the back row, there is no mic and you are not allowed to pick it up and make a comment. You have to suck it up, buttercup.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D3849s)

Yeah, I mean, people outside may not realize that women are not allowed to verbally participate in any of the occasions at all. The only thing they can do is select a hymn. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3862s) the only female voice you will hear in a Brethren church would be someone saying something like, "127, verse 3," very quietly, and then a brother will pick up the microphone and repeat it so it comes through the PA system so everyone can hear. And that's it. That's the only contribution they're allowed to make. Although there's one exception. There's one time in my life when I actually heard a woman speaking in a brethren [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3892s) room, and it was a young mother who had had an affair and had to publicly confess it in church in front of the entire congregation, in front of her children, in front of all her peers. And that was the only time I heard a woman speaking in a PBCC meeting room. Public shaming. Public shaming.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3916s)

This picture right here is what needs to change with this church, this cult. This has, this is where the change has to be made, Bruce. Females need to be sitting with their spouses and their kids or whoever they choose to, and they need to be able to pick up a mic and say what they want to say. And I know that scares the shit out of you because you know how feisty females can be.

And the other thing I want to point out here is you look at this picture, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3947s) they talk about, that's their word that I've really, this been coming forward lately is how they're calling everything satanic that everybody on the outside does. This is the most satanic picture you could ever see. With these kinds of benches, everything is in a circle. I don't think they realize how satanic their practices are. Everybody sits in a circle, women at the back, men in the front. They don't realize altars that they pray over every Sunday [morning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3977s) They just do not understand how satanic and cult-like their practices are.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=3987s)

Particularly when it comes to the prayer meeting, when they're sitting around on the front row and they all solemnly, all the men, take in turns to stand up and pray for the death of people who are opposed to Bruce Hales. I mean, you know, short of actually having voodoo dolls, it's about as good as you can get, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4006s)

This is the part, this is the part lately that's really, really fired me up and aggravated me of just hearing people's the word satanic coming back. And I've been holding back on this for a long time and it's just aggravated. This picture, as soon as I saw it, I'm like, if anybody wants to walk in and witness what an actual service was like in there, they would walk out and be like, "That was the most satanic thing I ever [experienced."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4036s)

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4036s)

100% creepy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4038s)

It is.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4040s)

I had an outsider recently that saw them, I saw a group of them and she told me, she goes, "Lane, what is with, they were so creepy. They were all wearing white, you know." And at first I was like, "Oh yeah, Sunday, it was Sunday." Yeah, she was just so creeped out by seeing them all wearing white, right? And she was just like, she was like, "It was so culty looking." And I'm like, "Yep, that's because they are one."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4069s)

Most, most churches don't have circular auditoriums, right? But you go to anything satanic, everything's done in a circle.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4082s)

Interesting, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4084s)

You just, it's just there's so many sitting back and reviewing this lately. I've just been really, wow, my mind is being blown with how many satanic practices they have and they don't realize what they're doing. I mean, maybe they do. Maybe their ancestors knew what they were doing. Maybe some of those people, I mean, we've talked about Massimo Introvigne being part of their community, coming in and out. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4115s) I think there's an elite group that knows what goes on in this cult. I 100% do. Just from what I've experienced, I do think that there is. I don't think everybody knows what's going on. So I'm just letting you know that they use a circle. More energy is gathered, more power is gathered, so they believe, when it's done in a circle. So that's why you don't see this in other mainstream Christian churches. You just don't.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4141s)

They have insanely creepy practices. They do.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4147s)

Issues created by extreme gender bias. So there's a number of issues that are created with these extreme gender biases. Number one, reports of sexual abuse due to all-man priests. And in that, the PBCC, when they go and speak to someone that has made a mistake or whatever, they refuse to include women in their priestly visits. And one of the things that is a huge [problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4177s) is the number of young girls that have come forward and said they've been abused by the all-man priests that come and talk to them when they've made mistakes and they've opened themselves up by not including God's pattern of men and women together as equal partners in a marriage or equal partners in life. By excluding women, they have left themselves open for a huge liability.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4207s)

So if you do decide to start including women in your priestly visits, make sure you give them a voice. Because we notice you're creating a trend with watching our podcasts and then making these very band-aided fixes. But I just want to know that if you are a female that gets invited to a priest, make sure you also exercise your authority to have a voice in that priestly visit.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4232s)

Number two, extreme discomfort of females discussing sexual abuse and gender issues with all-male priestly teams. And this one is a big one. And I know, you know, that we've had so many young sisters come forward and say, "These two men came over and talked to me and asked me all these in-depth questions about the sexual abuse." It's completely unacceptable. A mainstream Christian church would use a male-[female](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4262s) partner in a situation like that, or they would use several sisters. This kind of priestly activity should never be done on young females by a couple of old men. That is completely unacceptable and it is completely abusive.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4282s)

And even when police do their police investigations, if you're reporting sexual abuse, right, often if it's a female, you'll get a female police. I had a female police, but my team that went around to other people that were included in some of the Maple Creek stuff, it was a male-female police team, right? And that's literally what it should be.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4304s)

And I'm just gonna put this out here, sorry, but when reporting abuse, okay, and talking about very, very traumatic things like this, in my opinion, unless your priest in whatever church you belong to has specific training, then I think you can bypass that altogether. Go to police and go to therapy and maybe a medical professional of some type, right, to get counseling. I'm sorry, but a lot of these priests do not have the qualifications [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4338s) the training to deal with this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4342s)

Unless they've gone through it, right? None of them do. I mean, in a mainstream Christian church, youth counselors would go through extensive training as to how to deal with these things, how to speak to people, how to understand trauma. How many brethren priests have had that training? None. None at all.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4360s)

Yeah, yeah, I meant sorry, I meant churches in general, but yes, none of the brethren have. And I'm gonna, I've talked about this before, I'll reiterate it again. You don't have to speak to these fucking priests. It's not a legal obligation. And if you do, okay, if you do feel the pressure that you do need to speak to them, I know it might go against your morals or something, but consider it at least. You don't have to feel guilty about lying to them. These are not good [people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4390s) They are not there for your best interest. They're there for the assembly, as they would call it, and the truth, and protecting Bruce Hales. Yeah, feel free to bullshit to them. Cover up those sins, right? If it's not illegal, they don't need to know about it. Or if it is illegal, go to the police and confess it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4407s)

Yeah, and you can also in everybody's town, there are social services there, right? So if you trust that method, you can call up social services and request social services to be present, right? I think the thing is what happens inside there is that these people just don't know that there's these choices and these options, right? If the police scare you, if say a medical professional scares you, social services, there are very kind [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4437s) within social services. There really is. I mean, some of the best therapists that I've gone through, that's what they just have a social service degree. And so you can, they're trained for that kind of thing. They really are trained for that. So you can look or reach out to us an email, say, "Hey, I'm in this locality or I'm in this area. Can you find me social services that you need help with?" We'll help you out with that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4464s)

Okay, go ahead. Number three, household dysfunction is because all decisions were made by men. And we talked about this in the widows and the assembly or widows for the truth. Household dysfunction because households that don't have a man in them, they get zero representation in all decisions that are made right down to the Sunday breaks. You get no say in who comes to your house, who gets placed at your house for a meal. You just get a phone call and you get told you're having thus and such for at your house for dinner. And there's no input. If you don't have a male in your house, you get zero choice. Number four, religious [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4506s) because the sisters were not allowed to speak in the meeting when the entire meeting was an attack on them.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4512s)

Yeah, that's what we spoke about before, right? They don't even give mics to the back rows for the women. So there's not even an opportunity for them to stand up for themselves or say, "Excuse me, that doesn't sound right." Like they're, that's not even a question in the minds of them, honestly, because they're just so controlled.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4534s)

This is such a huge, this was a huge issue in Maple Creek. I remember, I remember witnessing and having to sit through these where they would just, oh, it was such horrific intimidation, such horrific abuse that would happen.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4553s)

And so cowardly. I mean, these are like grown men, big grown men just tearing, publicly tearing apart women who were effectively gagged so they couldn't possibly answer back in any way. I mean, what a pathetic and cowardly and unmanly way to proceed.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4573s)

Yep, bullying. It's straight up bullying.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4577s)

Yeah, but it's like bullying someone who's tied to a chair and gagged. That's the level of bullying. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. My favorite, favorite, I gotta tell you this story. My favorite, favorite in Maple Creek, we had an entire meeting that was focused on moi. I can't imagine why. But dear old Uncle Dudley Boyer, and I'm gonna use his name because he can't reject, he can't fight me now, took this meeting [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4607s) how Lot's wife was turning into a pillar of salt. And the entire hour was directed at me that I was turning into a pillar of salt.

And I was so livid by the end of the meeting because of course I couldn't say anything back. And I had four little kids sitting beside me and Rick had one down beside him. And I just remember before even the last hymn was given out, I put everything back in my diaper bag. And as soon as the prayer was [done,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4637s) I was up and out of there. And I remember hitting the door probably a little bit harder than I should have and the bar went smack on the door. And I got outside and Rick come running out there and he's like, "Are you all right, honey?" And it had started to rain and I remember sticking my arms out like this and I said, "I am not all right, but damn it, I'm not a pillar of salt because see, the rain's hit me and I'm not melting."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D4670s)

If I could make a really bad pun, would you classify that as verbal a-salt?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D4677s)

Verbal assault, yes, that's hilarious. And I stood there and the raindrops literally sizzled as they hit my skin.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D4685s)

Or should we say a lot of verbal assault? 

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D4690s)

No honey, you're not salt, you're sugar. See, you're clumping.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4695s)

But that's true. But that's how they did it. I remember so many times at after a meeting, I mean, I was a teenager, I did that where as soon as the last prayer, I'd be the first one up, out, and hit that door as hard as you could on the way out. I mean, the way they treated females, and I mean, from what we hear inside there, it's no different, right? I mean, they're trying to make it look like all the ecosystem needs these sisters. They've tried changing the wording. The thing is, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4726s) you can't sit there and apply these little tiny band-aids to these big huge cracks into the foundation because what's happening inside localities and inside homes is still the same thing. So going to a UBT seminar and talking about how the ecosystem needs these sisters or you're responding to a news article on how good you treat these women and how they have a specific place in the ecosystem, it's a bunch of, it's absolutely a bunch of, so yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4758s)

Number five, lack of commitment to new rules because the sisters had no say. They were to be silent. So this is just a memo for Mr. Bruce, that if he would allow the sisters to have a little bit of say when he brought out new rules, he might find there was a whole lot more commitment to them. Just my observation. This is all free advice, Mr. Bruce. We won't be sending you an invoice.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4788s)

Oh, I am. Oh, and this is a good one from the Palmy Party.

 “There is a lack of genuine care and compassion because generally speaking, the maternal side reflects that.”

 And because the maternal side is always silenced and not involved, there's a lack of genuine care and compassion. Absolutely. Yeah. And this comes back to the priestly thing. I mean, the priestly shouldn't happen anyway. The whole concept is warped. But if you had a female [priest,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4818s) I am sure you would get a lot more care and compassion than with the old man.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4824s)

Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Okay.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4829s)

So you say we want to prove gender bias. So we did a little bit of research and we pulled up the Canadian school trustees. Actually, we pulled up all the trusts. And what we noticed is out of 45 board members, secretaries, trustees, and directors, there is not a single female on the board across Canada. Does that smell like gender bias? Could just [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4859s) a coincidence.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4861s)

I mean, it's typical behavior for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. I mean, I thought they made it very clear, the brethren, that all their females in the ecosystem are now equally working for Campus\&Co, right? They don't have time to do anything else because they're just so busy working for the assembly at Campus\&Co.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4884s)

Yes, except, of course, they don't get paid. That's another issue, but we'll get on to that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4890s)

Yeah, that's our next one.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4892s)

So let's go with Richard's. It could be just a coincidence. Oops. We also located all the meeting room trusts. We believe we found the biggest percentage of all the meeting room trusts across Canada with $50.8 million in assets, a hundred trust members, directors, secretaries, and board members. Not a single female. I wonder if this is more evidence of gender bias.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4921s)

Maybe just a little. Yeah, I think they might be on to something. A hundred members.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4931s)

So women referred to in the Bible and Christian service. Number one, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, ministered to Jesus. Women in John 4 left her water pot and went into the city and sayeth to the man, "Come see a man that told me all things." Evangelism.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4950s)

Euodia and Syntyche, "Help those women which labored with me in the gospel." Philippians, in the gospel. And so Paul recognized Euodia and Syntyche as two women that helped him and labored with him in the gospel. Jesus called all his disciples together and pointed out the poor widow, and that was when he was collecting all the money from all the rich guys and the poor widow just put in her two mites. And lo and behold, he recognized that she put in [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=4980s) than any of the men around her.

Number five, Paul commands Phoebe, which she was a servant of the church. Number six, Paul commands the church to greet Aquila and Priscilla and Aquila, his helpers in Christ, in that order. In that order, yes. Yes. Number seven, when Jesus entered a certain village, Martha received him into her house. Lo and behold, she was only a woman in the house, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5010s) Jesus felt good enough to stay in her house, even though there wasn't a man in the house. You can't have a Lord's Supper in the house when there's not a man in the house, but Jesus could stay in the house when it was only Martha.

Aquila and Priscilla took Apollos to them and expounded the way of God more exactly.

Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, worshiped God by fasting and praying. Number 10, the woman that left her water pot, many of the Samaritans believed on him because of her testifying. Wow. Number 11, Deborah was known as a compassionate leader of Israel. And I thought this was interesting, she's the only woman judge mentioned in the Bible. I don't think you'd find a brethren woman as a judge, but there was a woman in the Bible [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5061s) was a judge, the only judge in the land, and she was the leader of Israel. Absolutely. Yep. Number 12, Miriam, a prophetess and Moses's sister, and she saved him from being killed by Pharaoh.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5077s)

So let me throw my, I gotta throw my atheism in there. Hold on a second. Not one of the books of the Bible, not even one, is written by a female. It's all written by dudes. Just saying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5087s)

There probably were some, but someone deleted them at some point, some old guy. But yeah, I mean, it's very, very clear from those Bible quotes that women clearly did speak and they taught and they prophesied and they spoke to men and they preached the gospel to men. And the Bible is full of these prominent women. I mean, anyone who's been brought up in the Brethren, or let me rephrase that, anyone who reads the Bible [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5117s) be able to reel off names of prominent women in the Bible. Now, how many names of prominent women in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church can you think of?

And how many can you find in the White Book? Exactly. None. Absolutely none. Where are the Deborahs? Where are the Miriams, the Annas, the Priscillas? They're not there. They're completely silenced. They're gagged. They can't give a testimony. They can't prophesy. They can't preach the gospel. It's a complete denial of everything that's in the Bible.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D5150s)

Yeah. And Bruce is supposedly their Paul. So, Bruce, let's get back to the pattern. Read Romans, I believe it's Romans 1 and verse 1 through 16\. In those verses, Paul calls out 10 different people that helped him along the way. And guess what? Seven of those were women. Wow. So Bruce, in your ministry, let's find [seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5178s) women mentioned in your ministry in the next, you know, a couple of white books or so. Well, there you are. That's your next reading sorted out for you. Yeah, you're supposed to be the Paul of the PBCC. So let's go by the Pauline pattern.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D5194s)

I think it's time we got rid of the Paul and got a Pauline instead. That would be an improvement.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5203s)

Oh wow. I started just reading this next one. I didn't get this far. Yeah, let's go into this sample of...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5210s)

Gender bias. Sisters can't cut brothers' hair. I didn't know that, actually. Sisters can't cut their hair. Yeah, that sisters can't cut boys under seven. I didn't know this.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5221s)

this iIs actually the policies for the barber shops that are inside Campus\&Co. And if you read down the procedures, you will find these three samples of gender bias in the policies at the Campus\&Co. In the policies, no sisters are allowed to cut the brother's hair. No sisters are allowed to have haircuts, which we knew that one. But, and sisters can only cut boys' hair under the age of seven.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5252s)

I got a question. I got a question. Sorry. What happens, what happens to their hair the day after their eighth birthday? Does it start sinning? Is there sin in the hair? Too much male sin? It's leaking out of the head? What the fuck happens to the hair at eight?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5276s)

It is bizarre, and the only explanation I can think of is that by the time a boy is eight, he's regarded as having sufficient masculine qualities that it would be disrespectful for a woman to cut his hair. It would be, what other explanation is there?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5299s)

There is a lot of girls in there that cut their hair. So I mean, there's a lot of people that go against this. I mean, you look at those pictures of them and there's a lot of sisters that have cut their hair. So I mean, I can't believe that this is on there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5316s)

Yeah, I saw, I see another one there that I've got a little question about. And I think I have the answer. So, no coloring or tinting to hair. So remember this? Yeah, you weren't allowed to tint your hair. Now I think I figured out why. So you know how the females, the sisters in the brethren, have to wear scarves, right? And I was told that this was specifically so angels could identify them from the other nasty civilians that are all going to burn in hell, [right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5346s) So I think if you dye your hair, the angels can't recognize you anymore.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5355s)

Oh, we've missed you, Lane. You should come on more often.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5360s)

Yeah, that could be totally possible.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5363s)

Yeah, like a detective on this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5365s)

You are a detective that's not going to get paid yet.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5372s)

Good old Campus\&Co. They've given us some really good ammunition. In the Campus\&Co policy handbook, we read where one of the health and safety concerns is where we can exceed to ensure the safety of our largely female volunteer base. Did you know Campus\&Co stores have one paid employee? The rest of it is run 100% on volunteer labor.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5407s)

They misspelled slave labor.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5412s)

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5413s)

And almost 100% of that is women. It's the sisters that are supposed to be at home taking care of their houses. Yeah, they get drafted to go in and run the Campus\&Co. And do you know how the drafting is done? This is also in, we were sent this in their policy manual. The way they draft people to run the Campus\&Co stores is they put your name on a rota. They don't ask you first. They put your name on the rota and if you can't [go,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5443s) it's your responsibility to find a replacement. Now, if that's not coercive control, I don't know what is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D5451s)

So that doesn't sound very volunteering to me.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DG5qtYpvzWGY%26t%3D5455s)

Yeah, they definitely missed the quotes off the "volunteer." And if you try to get out of it, you will get a little conversation and they will explain that your volunteer labor, you're working for Jesus.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5470s)

We have female insiders that talk about not wanting to go and work here. It's not volunteer. It is completely coercive control of making them go do it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5479s)

Yeah, yeah. And I remember I talked to an ex-member that would say that when they, if they didn't or couldn't get the appointment or they couldn't make it that week, they would just get harassed and harassed. "Oh, we missed you. Why didn't you show up? Why weren't you there?" Right? So they just get pushed and pushed and pushed to volunteer. It's being volun-told is what it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5502s)

I love that. So this is a PBCC rebuttal to a news article: "Many women are business owners." He denies that women have a lesser status. “In fact, the role of women is very important, including direct involvement in the Lord's Supper.”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5521s)

Oh great. They get to bring the bread to the one communion a week. What a big responsibility. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5529s)

Yeah, I mean, to people who don't know, the only role the women have in the communion service is that they put the bread and the wine on the table. So they just get up completely silently, place the bread and wine on the table, then go and sit down again. Other than that, the only thing they can do is suggest hymns by just saying a number. So that's a direct involvement in the Lord's Supper. Well, whoopee. I mean, you know, they're just, because people outside don't know what actually goes on, they can make these grand sounding statements. It all sounds very credible, but if people outside knew the facts, they would just be falling over laughing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5572s)

Right? And in this article, they say some women would certainly hold critical positions in a business.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5581s)

Oh\!

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5582s)

So you know how they say some women? I mean, we know that this is just a bunch of absolute BS, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5590s)

Well, I mean, there's an interesting point here because this is a very good example of telling the truth to hide the truth. Because they say many women are business owners, and that is true in the sense that the way the brethren's tax avoidance scheme works is that women are actually shareholders in the business. So if the husband owns a business, on paper, in the shareholding, his wife will also be an equal [shareholder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5620s) or a slightly smaller shareholder.

And the reason for that is they then divide their income that they draw is divided between the two of them, so it comes into a lower tax bracket. But the woman doesn't have any influence or say in the business or attend the board meeting. They just nominally, on paper, a business owner, and that's just for the tax advantage. It's not a question of control or having any influence or say in the business whatever. So it's telling the truth to tell a lie and give [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5650s) impression that women are actually running the business. No, technically they own it so that they could split the joint income and pay less tax.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5658s)

Yeah, and here are some quotes from Bruce Hales's ministry on their views of women. "The beloved sisterhood, you see, their wills have to be broken. When our wills are broken, it's very fine, isn't it? The Lord can use it. The Lord can use us in the testimony. Sisters might say at times, 'Well, what use are we?' Very, a very great use, a very great value."

"The sisterhood being true are very, very great value. And it's through suffering really. It's through being perhaps being overlooked, through being under reproach even." 

And the next one is,

 "I wouldn't know that the sisters have got much time for meditation, but it would be good if they gave a little time to meditation. I think that would set them free more from their cares."

And another one,

 "If the mother is giving into the world, well, she'll find it difficult to make a stand against unsuitable clothing in the daughters. See, young sisters wearing trousers, men's clothing, is totally unsuitable. I don't agree with it ever. Some people say, 'Well, they need it to protect themselves when they're at work.' Well, they're doing the wrong job. Our beloved brother was absolutely and utterly uncompromising about it. You can be mocked by the world, but what we're standing by will go through."

And this one is from November 2010 in Sydney.

 "I remember he, J.S.H., went to a business place in '94 in England and I remember talking to him later and he was distressed in his spirit. He was overworked, of course, but when he went through, he saw worldly women in trousers and that distressed him. You know, in a brother's workplace. You see, we don't realize we might be going back to these things just because we haven't got the guts to stand up to it because we're watching the bottom line. That won't help the bottom line anyhow."

All quotations are from Subject Index to the Ministry of B.D. Hales, Bible and Gospel Trust 2014\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5773s)

Yeah, so this is a letter by a brother called Edward Steedman who was present in Aberdeen in 1970 at the famous meetings when JTJr. was caught in bed with Mrs. Ker. And he wrote a very long letter detailing, he was actually in the house, he wrote a long letter detailing everything he witnessed which was very, it was a very balanced letter. He spoke actually quite affectionately of JTJr. and referred to the good things he had done in the past and how he'd helped the brethren, but he said he felt he had to give an accurate account of what proceeded.

And so this is just an extract from his very long letter. He runs through the whole meetings, everything that happened in detail. So he says, 

"We arrived at J.A.G.'s house," (that's Mr. Gardner's house) "on Thursday evening. Mr. Taylor was in bed resting and joined us about 7 p.m. He very soon paid a great deal of attention to the sisters, spoke in a crude way of their having had relations with men and constantly asked different [ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5850s) when the results would be, ‘when is the delivery?’

He made reference to bras and to take them off and seemed obsessed with the sisters' breasts. He made one sister after another sit on his knee. With one especially, he kissed her for minutes at a time, putting his mouth over hers and sucking her in a most peculiar way, all the time fondling and caressing her body, making her husband look out the window while doing so. 

His tactics [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5880s) other sisters he wanted was to say that they didn't like his ministry, were not with him and so on, until they came to him. This went on until the Kers came about 9 p.m. They should not have been there, but Jim insisted that they stay so that J.A.G. and his wife had to sleep in most difficult circumstances. When he had gone off to bed, we found the first sister he had handled very upset. We found in the morning she was nearly hysterical through the night."

...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5913s)

.He was a predator. And this is what Bruce Hales is trying to cover up. I want to now share this video.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5919s)

There was a bunch of brethren sitting around in the living room of somebody's house and he had her sitting beside him or on his knee or something and he was just rubbing these big boobs and quite enjoying himself. And my sister, she had already told us that after one meeting, he had been talking with her and he had done the same with her. And his explanation was, "All these people are making a fuss of me just showing the affection to my, you know, a sister I love." That was his reasoning, that it was okay for him to do it because he loved these ladies.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5971s)

Wow. So he was doing this quite publicly? This wasn't done behind closed doors?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=5978s) 

It wasn't done privately. No, it was done publicly. And I remember driving over there with Martha and the two of us say, "What do we do if he does it to you?" And I don't think we came to a conclusion. We'll just, we'll play it by ear that, yeah, it wasn't right. Yeah. But he was a man of God. And is the Lord telling him to feel my wife up? It was a dilemma.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6011s)

Wow. I think it's what they call cognitive dissonance, where you have to simultaneously believe two things that are contradictory. And you know, that almost sums up the brethren, is that you have to believe things that you simultaneously know not to be true.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6031s)

That's really good. Yeah. This guy, right, to my generation in the church is not as well known, right? Like Aberdeen is so kind of covered up and hidden that a lot of young people in the church, I don't think really know what a creep and a predator this guy was. Like I didn't, I didn't know all these stories until they started coming out about how blatant his sexual harassment and abuse is. It's just disgusting. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6062s)

Yeah, and very clearly using coercive control and using his spiritual, religious power. I mean, in that first letter, how he was shaming the sisters into coming over to be fondled by saying, "You're not with me," and, "You're not a good Christian unless you come over here and let me feel you up." I mean, it's the most sort of blatant and disgusting. I mean, to me, it's worse. 

I mean, the fact that he was sleeping [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6092s) Madeleine Ker, to me, is, well, you know, that was probably a kind of a consensual relationship between consenting adults. You could credit him with that. But this wasn't. This was him just shaming people, using his religious authority to shame people to come over and to be just groped and felt up. And I mean, these are just two accounts. There's lots of other accounts of this happening. And even happening in meeting rooms, he would sit on the front row at the end of the meeting and call sisters to come down to the front row and sit on his knee and he would feel their breasts and feel them up and down.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6132s)

Like we know that women have not had, like they've been sitting in the back seat of this whole movement of the Plymouth Brethren, Exclusive Brethren, whatever you want to call it at all their stages. But to me, JTJr. was the one that made it okay. He was the one that set it in the minds of all of the men to come after him that this is okay, this is how we can treat women. And I'll end it there with letting you all come to your own conclusion. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5qtYpvzWGY&t=6162s) to the women and to the children, to the teens inside the PBCC, you have a choice. I hope that you can stand up and find a way to battle the women's rights issues within there on all levels. Make sure you reach out to us if you're needing help.

And I look forward to what this next year holds for us. We have a lot to come forward. If you thought the first year had a lot in it, just you wait. Our second year has, we're so busy. There's so much on the plates right now that we don't even have time to chew it all off. So we just have to be patient and we'll get to it as it comes. So we just want to all say thank you for listening, thank you for supporting us.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
