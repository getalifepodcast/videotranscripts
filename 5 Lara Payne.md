## Summary

*Trigger warning* *Discussion regarding sexual abuse* Viewer and listener discretion is advised
Lara invites us into her harrowing story while inside the PBCC. She recounts how she tried to get help regarding her abuse and how she was even sent to Maple Creek! At the time Lara’s abuse was happening there were 23 members and of those there are potentially 10 children as victims of sexual abuse. She takes us through what it was like to be a female within the church and how "women were slaves". Her heart wrenching story on the day she left, brought us all to tears as we all knew of the pain she described. We dive into the leaders promise of the rapture and the lies covered up during a split in the 60's called Aberdeen. Could this have been the open door for abuse to be so widely accepted? Cheryl also gives us an update on the investigation in Maple Creek.

### [**Lane Admiraa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3s)**l**

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We're here with Carman, Richard, Cheryl, and Lara.

We also have some pretty important news. Here at Get-A-Life Podcast, we care about everybody's health, regardless of what church you're in. We've seen some footage of Bruce Hales recently, and we are terrified. You guys need to get your leader to an emergency fitness facility. He is minutes away from a coronary or a heart attack. Like, I'm not kidding, guys. This guy's like at least 350 [pounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=43s) all in the belly. Seriously, it's very, very severe. And we hope that he can get into a gym ASAP. Carman, take us away.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=54s)

Hey, this morning, we're here with one of my friends from San Antonio, Texas, and she is going to tell us a little bit about her journey through the PBCC church that we used to go to. And this is Lara Payne. Lara, take it away for us.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=72s)

All right. I'm excited to be here today. Since having heard Cheryl's story on James DiFiore's podcast Blackballed, I have felt very emboldened to come on and tell my story. So for, I guess you would say legal reasons, James chose not to have me on this podcast and that's okay. And you guys have a podcast and so now I can share my story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=106s)

We're really grateful you're here.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=108s)

I'm grateful to be here too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=110s)

Why don't you tell us how old you were when you first even started thinking about leaving?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=119s)

Like seriously, probably 15, 16\. Now, I didn't leave until I was 21\. It took me some time to get finances together, to come to terms with like, I know how I'm going to be treated. I had an older brother that left when I was 12\. I was in seventh grade and he was a senior in high school. And you know, for lots of reasons, but like the icing on the cake or the straw that broke the camel's back, he wanted to go to prom and of course that's not allowed. So [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=161s) why he left. That's the, you know, like reason that he left that day was he was going to prom. He didn't care.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=171s)

So this was before the Brethren run high schools?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=175s)

Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We all went to public school back then. That was in 1990 that he left.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=186s)

What would you say in your case was the straw that broke the camel's back?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=191s)

Oh, we'll get to that.

So in the years leading up to my leaving, as any teenager I'm sure goes through these like questions, like I know I've been told this crap all my life but is it really true? Do I really believe it? You know, just wrestling with what does the scripture actually say versus what the brethren are saying? And I think probably every teenager goes through that. Do I believe what my parents have told me? I don't have a teenager. Mine's nine. But those of you who have raised [kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=236s) probably can say, yeah, your kids go through this time where they're like, I don't know what I really believe, what I really think. Do I believe everything my parents say? I don't know.

So it actually got pretty bad. I was at the point of like, I really, really was angry with my parents. So I actually went to live with another family for a brief amount of time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=263s)

What city were you in?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=264s)

San Antonio, Texas. So what's unique about San Antonio compared to most of the other PBCC localities is that San Antonio geographically speaking is very, very far away from any other city that has brethren in it. So I think much like Maple Creek, it was kind of isolated. So [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=295s) had different issues, I don't know that maybe the rest of the PBCC group didn't have.

And I'm just gonna call it out, we had a major issue with sexual abuse. And oh yeah, of minors, and I was one of the victims and I was making noise and they didn't like it. I was flat out told to my face, if you keep talking about it, you're the sinner. Like basically, [shut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=331s) up or we're gonna kick you out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=334s)

Wow. This was a priest that said that to you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. If you keep talking about it, you're the sinner, talking about sexual abuse? That's disgusting.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=347s)

Yes, yes. How many people would you say like locality wise, how many brethren would have been in San Antonio, like that locality? Okay, so while I was growing up, there was four families. I don't know, should I call them all out? 

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Well, that's up to you. That's up to you. I mean, 

**Lara Payne**

I don't think there's nothing wrong in saying it. There was the Burroughs family, there was the Walker family, there was the Holt family, and there was the Franzen family. That was my family.

The locality of San Antonio started during Vietnam because San Antonio was where you went for basic training in the army before you got sent overseas or like, you know, when you got drafted. That's where you went for your basic training. And because there were so many young men going through basic training, I don't remember, maybe Carman, you know this part of the story. [Was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=409s) it Mr. Symington that decided there should be a family here so that the men would have somewhere to go on Sunday morning for the Lord's Supper? I think that was why it started.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=422s)

Yeah, because my dad was one of those. Dad and mom got stuck down there for months at a time and the closest meeting was of course like Gothenburg which was what, 10 hours?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=433s)

No, it's like 15 or 16\.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=436s)

Okay. Yeah, I knew it was a long ways.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=438s)

Yeah, yeah. So Tim Walker moved from New York. The Burroughs family, there's two families, there's John and Betty Burroughs and David, Rhoda Burroughs, they moved from Chicago. Dan and Sue moved from Knoxville. And my mom and dad got married, they actually got, my dad was stationed in Seattle and my mom's from Vancouver and they got married and they lived in Seattle for a brief time and both of their [families](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=468s) left in the big 1970s split and they came to Texas kind of as like somewhere to go. I don't know, my dad had gone, didn't he go through the military with your dad, Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D482s)

Yep, yep, they did. There was three of them, basic training together.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=489s)

Yeah, yeah and there was, there was a Bottom, oh that's right, that's right. So they, my dad came here also just because he had been here through the military training. Shortly after he came, you know this whole, there's no hierarchy but there is a hierarchy, he was made the priest at the ripe old age of [28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=519s).

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=522s)

So just to give the listeners a view on what that means, that means so every in every locality they would call it, that means just a city or a town that has brethren members in it. One, a group in every single one, there would be one that's the leader of that locality and usually it's an elder guy. So being a 28-year-old leader of that place would be like...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=545s)

Like he was the youngest, like why was he even made the leader? I've kind of always wondered that. So nothing in this church makes sense, of course. So prior to me being born, he had become the leader. So the first 10 years of my life, he was the leader in San Antonio of this very, very small [locality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=576s). As I was growing up, if you take those four families and all of their kids, there was a total of 23 brethren. That's it. That's who we went, we saw these same 23 people every single night, every Sunday, you know, like talk about in your business.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=600s)

So your social circle was only 23 people?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=604s)

Went to church with them every night. That was the only friends you're allowed to have. I mean like...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=611s)

Just too, sorry I interrupted you, Lara. Oh no, I was just gonna ask her, out of the 23 then, how many would have been the kids and how many of them would have been affected by the abuse you were describing?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=623s)

Okay, well there's five families, so that's 10 adults and the rest were kids, 13 kids.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=633s)

How many of the, how many of the elders in in the church do you think were aware of this abuse?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=646s)

They should have all been. I don't know for a fact if they were, but they should have all, it's that small of a community, you would assume, right? You could easily assume that they would have known. So sadly, it started from basically the oldest kid, I'm gonna let him remain anonymous. Yeah, that's okay. [He's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=677s) not, he's not in the brethren, but he's the one that started it all. He abused his own brother and sister and I know for a fact that he abused more than one person in each family. So literally everyone should have known.

So here's my dilemma. This is where I get like, it actually starts to [choke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=707s) me up sometimes. My dad's the leader and all this stuff is happening to me as I'm growing up. It started from age four and from what I can gather from my notes, I've kept extensive journals my entire life. It pretty much ended when I was 12\. Everything that you can think of happened. I was raped. I was sodomized. I was made to perform oral sex. Like I was fondled, I was molested, I was whatever you want to call it happened.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=752s)

I'm so sorry you went through that. Wow.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=755s)

So really Cheryl, when you told your story, like I feel like our stories are so similar in the sense of horrific things happened and no one would do anything. So my dilemma always is, I don't understand. If my dad's the leader, why didn't he make it stop? I don't know. Is he, even in a position of leadership, was he [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=785s) scared to do something about it? Is the brainwashing in the brethren so rampant that even a leader can't stand up and say this has to stop? That's my question. I've asked my dad that, like why didn't you do anything? And he doesn't have a good answer. It's just sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D805s)

I think that's where it gets lost, right? And I think that's what needs to be [researched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=816s) and investigated is what is that? What is so prevalent on top of these parents that their own gut instinct and their natural capability to protect their child is wiped from them? Because we've had lots of conversations, Lara, right? Like it's, and I understand you're, so people that have listened to my story, I want you now to just realize that this isn't just about my story. We now have Lara who [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=851s) can witness to what she's told me is very similar to what I went through.

And now we have her dad who was in the lead that also couldn't, couldn't defend his own child. Yeah. Like what is it systematically across the board? Like I think, you've said like from JTJr.'s time on. Yeah, since 1960, let's just pick 1960 or '59, the [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=882s) eating matter, from then on it has just gotten more and more and more radical. I mean, it's a full-blown cult now. I don't think John Darby set out, I don't think John Darby set out to create a cult.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=900s)

What more crimes does this cult need to commit to get shut down? Murder? I don't know. Is it got to be genocide? There's already so many cases of sexual abuse of children.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=914s)

Yeah, let's go back to that. Let's go back to Aberdeen. Let's go back to to when we know everything is switched. You think of the reason why everything fell apart there was because of the claims made against JTJr., right? And that he was caught in bed with someone. How more clear, it doesn't get more clear than that. If you bring this conversation up with those that are still in, right? I mean, I've seen screenshots of ministry of what Mr. Hales says and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=946s) it's all lies, that people are still, that this is all lies.

And so I ask, do you think that the cover-up that happened from JT Jr's time in Aberdeen when that, when everything split, has allowed for the people and the pedophiles and this type of behavior? It was like this flag that was given to them, it said, hey, it's okay. It's okay if JT Jr got to do it and it was covered up. We now have gone from 1960 to 2022, [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=977s), how many years of this now that it's allowed to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I know for in my case, how protected Alan is. Alan is very protected. I literally got a message this morning about stuff that went to Tim Bond about somebody else. And that's Alan's nephew, right? And so I am calling Tim Bond out today. Tim Bond has had so much information including Terri that worked for them who went to them [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1008s) Alan and Garth's behavior. The covering, like I just think that it goes back to JT Jr's cover-up and how it was told, oh don't believe it, it's lies, but yet he was caught in bed.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1028s)

Oh, I remember washing his feet, that's bullshit. I remember being told by my parents that JTJr. said it was a way to cleanse the PBCC, or at the time, the Exclusive Brethren, the Plymouth Brethren. It was a way to cleanse all those who didn't believe. Like, the whole reason that [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1051s) was to expose all of the people who didn't believe in JTJr. as being the leader.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1059s)

That's the lie. That's the lie they told me as well. My mother told me that, that he did it to expose people that weren't loyal. Now to go to that lengths to get a woman naked in your bed and be wasted drunk and then after pretend to still be wasted drunk at church, it just...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1082s)

Doesn't make sense. How can, how can anybody, yeah, how can anybody who is, I would say what, like maybe 65 and older, 70 and older, how can anybody in that generation believe any of that crap?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1102s)

Like they have no critical thinking skills, exactly.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1106s)

And then that gets passed on to what are we now, two, three, four generations down the line? Like I mean, it's just disgusting. And because of that one individual in San Antonio, it affected every single family and it got passed to the next generation. Yeah, I don't have, I don't have proof. I cannot go to the police and say I know [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1136s) xyz did xyz. I just know what people have told me and what happened to you. Yeah, and my own, my own truth.

So and then to be told, okay, so now I'm going to bring up another person's name. I think you've mentioned it a couple of times, Lloyd Paskewitz used to be a bigwig, a United States leader or some crap. So this is what's interesting. In the middle of all this [shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1166s) happening in Maple Creek, they decide in August of 1998 to send me to three-day meetings in Maple Creek. Yeah, to speak with Mr. Lloyd about this issue. Like, it's mind-boggling now that I think back on it. I'm like, you literally sent me into the den of hell.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1197s)

You needed to speak to a police officer, not a fraudster.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1200s)

Exactly. I needed to go speak to a police officer. Instead, they sent me on, like it's a privilege to go to three-day meetings in the city where there's massive chaos.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1215s)

Like I think Jim just... Bruce Hales, when I was, when I was at...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1217s)

I think, I think Jim DeSeyn took those meetings, right Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1221s)

Yep, yep he was a big wig too.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1224s)

He was, he was very well known and people were like either on his side or against him and it caused all this drama.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1232s)

I don't know what to say about him. He's not in anymore either. And yet to me personally, to our family, he was a wonderful person. But he also was a leader, so who knows what he did in the name of the church as a leader.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1250s)

So go back for a little minute. There's a conversation that you and I have had that goes back to Cheryl's point about mama bear and protecting your kids. And tell us a little bit about your mom when your mom first realized what was going on and what she did about it or didn't do about it.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1267s)

This is hard for me and I think it's hard for my mom. I've had many conversations with her. I don't hold her to the same level of accountability that I hold leaders in the church because women were so second-class citizens. I mean, in my opinion, women were slaves. Yes, you were. You were there to serve your husband, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1298s) whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, raise the children, cook all the food, clean the house, and just perpetuate that from one generation to the next.

And from what she tells me, she saw evidence that something had happened to me and she couldn't do anything. She tried to do something and my dad being the leader told her that she was not allowed to do anything. So she didn't. And now as a parent, we are talking about some questions I have, like lingering questions 23 years later after having left. I still do not understand. I'm a mother. I have a nine-year-old daughter. If I saw what [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1360s) mom says that she saw, that person would be dead. I would be in jail.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1366s)

Yeah.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1367s)

So I just...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1371s)

How do they choose church over family every single time?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1376s)

And it's not just sexual abuse. Think about how many people's stories we've heard where the spouse was abused physically, physically abused, and the brethren's excuse was you're not being subservient enough, you're not being submissive. Those crimes are being covered up, physical abuse.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1401s)

I know the case, I know of a case of physical abuse of a child and the child actually wrote to Bruce Hales and Bruce Hales' response was a verbal response passed down through priests, right, because he doesn't want to give shit in writing. And the response was, well that's not being taken down to the basement, tied against a pole and whipped.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1422s)

What?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1425s)

So the abuse wasn't bad enough in Bruce Hales' mind. Physical abuse of the child, okay, was not bad enough. And Bruce said, well that's not being taken down to the basement, put against the pole and whipped. Well Brucey, Mr. Fatso, I'll fight you anytime, just saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1450s)

Do you think they didn't actually consider sexual abuse a bad thing? Like I, when I'm sitting here and I'm listening to the stories that land on my lap and listening to all this stuff, I honestly, I actually don't think that they view sexual abuse or kids being sexually abused as a bad thing. Like I don't think they, I don't think that they view it as a crime.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1478s)

Do they just know how bad of a crime that is? Like this is a terrible crime. And they're so culpable. Go ahead, Lara.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1485s)

This is what I think. I think they are so brainwashed that when facts land on their doorstep, like when I'm telling Lloyd Paskewitz to his face in detail what happened to me, genuinely, he almost teared up. Like, I think he was like genuinely shocked that this is actually occurring. So to my face, I [saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1515s) it. I have to read it because I get so angry.

This is the scripture. And this is what the brethren do. They take a scripture out of context. And they make it say whatever the hell they want it to say. This is in Colossians. Colossians chapter 3, verse 12\. “Since God chose you to be the holy people that he loves…” claiming they think that they're God's chosen right hand man, the brethren are ”...then you must clothe yourself with tender-hearted mercies, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.”

Mr. Lloyd's exact words were, they should have treated you with the most tenderhearted mercies. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1568s) should have shown you kindness. They should have been humble about it. They should have been gentle and patient with you.

To my face, he says that. Two months later, he turns it around. Here's the rest of that scripture. “Make allowance for each other's faults and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember that the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. And above all, clothe yourself with love, which binds us together in perfect harmony.”

 It was all I could do not to like, I mean, I'm okay, first of all, it's a priestly at someone else's house. I'm [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1614s) even at my own house. My dad is present, two leaders of the brethren are present, and Lloyd Paskewitz is on the phone and he says that shit to me.

I should forgive them. Wow. I said, I don't have anything to say right now. What I want to do is go to the care meeting and I want to expose these people who we are currently breaking bread with for the crimes they committed against me. Oh, that's not what the care meeting is for. Really?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1652s)

Let's give the listeners an idea of what the care meeting, what she means by breaking bread. So the care meeting is the monthly meeting that they hold, I think on a Saturday morning, yeah. And it's where they deal with all the issues and if anyone needs to get confined or kicked out, that's when they'll do it. And also that's when they spread all the loot around and they make donations in little envelopes that go all the way up to Mr. Brucey. And breaking bread just means that's what they refer to as communion that they do every Sunday. So when they say [someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1683s) we won't break bread with, that's someone outside the church is what they mean. Sorry, go on.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1687s)

So, I mean, literally, at this point, I'm 21 years old, and I'm sitting there going, what you're saying doesn't match with what the scripture says. You're saying I should forgive them. Like, how about first of all, you acknowledge that you did this. Why are we not having a care meeting and confining them? Them, why are they not, what's the word they use, confessing their sins before they break bread?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1725s)

We see this every single time. They take it out on the victim. They turn around and pick on the victim.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1732s)

And then to tell me, he's the one that said, if you keep talking about this, if you keep bringing this up, you're the sinner. We're telling you this matter is finished, basically. You've confessed your sin, it's over. And I'm like, nothing's over, you haven't fixed anything.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1757s)

And would you agree, would you agree Lara that because [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1763s) stuff happened within the PBCC community, even if those people are out now, that it still is a PBCC issue that they need to take care of?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1774s)

Yeah, systematically. I mean, look at what happened in Maple Creek, look at what happened in San Antonio. And I won't mention the names, I am friends with several ex-brethren that their stories are similar. The reason they are not brethren is because they were abused and it wasn't [dealt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1793s) with. I mean, and this is my thing, like it's not just sexual abuse, it's physical abuse, it's psychological abuse, it's systemic abuse, period.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1804s)

And I don't do anything. We should not care if Lloyd Paskewitz is out, if Jimmy DeSeyn is out, if people that did the abuse into Lara is out, it doesn't matter. The people, but the community still freaking needs to take care [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1823s) what happened inside there when it happened, even if we're talking about it 40 years later.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1829s)

I said the biggest excuse they give is, well that person's out, that person's out. And so, but they're not. Two of them are still in there. Well, there you go. They're still being protected for what they did to me. The third person that abused me is out. And I'm choosing not to mention that person's name. Go ahead, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1850s)

Can I just ask, how many perpetrators were there in San Antonio and roughly how many victims, just to put it in context, please?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1862s)

Okay, well, let me do the math. The person that started it all abused his brother and sister. That's two. And in one family, I think he abused three of them. In another family, pretty sure he abused three of their children, and in my family, two.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1885s)

Out of 23, there were other perpetrators?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1887s)

Well, because the first one did what he did, then in turn, some of those who were abused became abusers.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1898s)

Oh. Oh, okay. 

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1903s)

The three people that abused me were abused by the original person. And turned around and did it to me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1913s)

This is so dark.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1915s)

And that's why even when you take it to Maple Creek, like the amount of stories that I started hearing about Alan's dad, right? And then you have Alan and then all of a sudden you hear all these community stories coming to me about Alan's son, Garth. It's like, I don't get why, why a Christian church would not have some sort of intellectual cognitive function that would say, hey, this might end up in my family or maybe there's an issue here.

Like I just, that's why I wonder if they don't view this kind of abuse as like a bad abuse. If maybe they, I don't know, like that's just one of those things that's gone through my head lately, is that maybe they don't think that that is a sacred part of a soul. Maybe they, maybe it's not, maybe women really [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1969s) slaves. Maybe I don't, I don't know.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D1973s)

But I mean, it's not just females either that are getting abused. No, exactly. In San Antonio, it wasn't just girls. Yeah. There was boys also abused. And in turn, they did it. One of my perpetrators was a woman. Wow. I mean, she was a kid, but a teenager.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=1997s)

Talking about what Cheryl said about how they view it, you told me once about Lloyd Paskewitz's comment to you, and I believe it was in that meeting. If it's happened more than once, you can finish that story for us.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2014s)

So basically he said to me, and I will never understand this, in person, face to face with him at those Maple Creek 3-day meetings. I probably talked to him for 45 minutes to an hour after one of the meetings. It's so vivid that I've actually had flashbacks about that time. Actually fairly recently, I had a flashback about it. And I actually am a Christian, and I still very much believe in God. I think he was showing me something.

So in that flashback, I could see the Maple Creek meeting room and the parking lot. And next to it, there used to be, I don't know if it's still this way, there used to be fields, because it's a rural community. And I remember the wheat growing [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2069s) it's August, so however tall wheat is in August, straight over fields and fields of wheat and I'm standing there talking to them. And like, you know how in a flashback or in a vision you get like tunnel vision? Way far, far, far, far away across the field, I could hear someone calling my name. Someone who I respect [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2099s) is a true Christian showed me that that was God calling out to me. I'm here, I hear you.

And even though that person that was supposed to hear you, that was supposed to care, didn't hear you and they're standing right in front of you, I hear you. And all the lies that they told you, all the lies that you've believed about yourself from that person, they're not true. The scriptures they twisted are not true. That's not what that scripture [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2133s). And so it's revealed to me that there is a God and he loves me. And the reason he was so far away across the fields was because the evil was so great he couldn't be there. I thought that was pretty powerful explanation for my flashback.

Yeah, because what had happened was that scripture, I was at a bible study and that scripture got read or [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2163s) were discussing it and it triggered a flashback so violent that I started to like hyperventilate. I started to come undone in the bible study and I started sobbing. And the other women were like, what? I don't understand why is the scripture affecting you so drastically. And I'm like, I have to tell you what I heard when I heard that scripture, that it's me, that I'm the one that's supposed to be forgiving. And I said, that's not what that scripture is saying [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2204s) all.

Like to have a whole new light about what that scripture actually means. So let's fast forward from 15, 16, when I went to live with this other family and I realized that really wasn't solving my needs or solving my problems. I ended up going back home not too long after my 16th birthday. And basically from 16 and a half to 21, I was like, how do I save up enough money? How do I leave? Because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2236s) already had a brother that left. I already knew what was going to happen. You're going to be shut out. None of these people are going to be your friends. You're never going to be allowed to talk to them. When you pick up the phone and call your family, they're going to hang up on you. I already knew what was going to happen to me if I chose to leave because I had a brother that left and I saw what happened to him. So that's why it took me five years to leave.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2263s)

Did you stay in contact with your brother at all when when he was first out?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2266s)

That's probably another podcast.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2269s)

Fair enough.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2272s)

I have spoken to him. I actually went and lived with him briefly. I don't have a relationship as in I'm not friends with him for a lot of reasons. If he called me, I would not hang up the phone on him like the freaking PBCC do. But I already knew when I left what was going to happen. So that's why it took me five years that I want people to understand that you walk away from your entire life.

So fast forward to the day I left home. I've shared this part of [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2318s) testimony on Facebook. I shared it in the ex-brethren groups I think two years ago and I got a lot of Facebook messages after I shared it. The day I left, the Holy Spirit led me away. And I know some people are not believers, but there's no other explanation for it. I was working at a brethren business. I literally finished the job I was hired to do [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2349s) something told me to take my belongings with me at the end of that work day, like my personal stapler, my pens. You know, it may seem silly, but I felt the need to go and put them in my car. I knew I was not returning.

And then here's another part that is interesting about it. Something told me [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2379s) go and say goodbye to the owner of the business and his sons that work there. I never did that. I never, at five o'clock, I did not go out into the woodshop and say goodbye because technically you're going to see him again in two hours. You don't need to say goodbye. Like it's not normal, but I felt the need to go and say goodbye to them. And I remember them looking at me like, okay, bye. Like, I'm sure they were thinking like, you never come and say goodbye. Why are you saying goodbye to us today? And I didn't even realize then that I would never speak to any of them again.

So on my way home, there was three exits on the highway. San Antonio is a major city. There's three exits on the highway in a row, and I could take any of the three to get to my house. I didn't usually take the first one because it was through an industrial area. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2440s) anyways, that exit was blocked. There was a semi. I couldn't get off. I get to the next exit and miraculously, a different semi is blocking my exit. That's the one I usually took. I couldn't get off. The third exit approaches and I'm like getting mad. I'm like, I can't get off. I was blocked again. The next exit that opened up was magically like tons of space. I could get off. I remember getting off and pulling over into a gas station, shaking. Like, is this you, God? Did you block my exit?

Like, am I really not going home? Is there a reason why I said goodbye to those people? And shaking, like shaking, like this is happening, is this really happening? So I ended up driving to my one and only friend who was not brethren. I had come to know them, I'll just say because I just come to know them thankfully. I drove to their house and I ended up in front of their house, still shaking. I went to the door and I knocked on the door and I said, this is what just happened to me. Thankfully they were good Christians, not crazy Christians. And they said, I kind of think it's pretty clear you're not supposed to go home, but we don't want to make that decision for you. We don't want to tell you what to do. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2543s) our suggestion. Go home and pray to God. Get down on your knees and ask God to tell you, is today the day? Are you really supposed to leave today?

So I did that. I got home. My bedroom was right inside the front door. I closed the door, locked it. I got down on my knees and I literally was praying, are you really telling me to leave today, God? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2573s) he said yes, get up and pack. He said it twice, really clearly, get up and pack. And I remember I wrote this in my, I'm writing a book, I wrote this in my memoir as part of the story. I stood up and pulled the two suitcases out from under my bed and I started throwing stuff in there. And then I stopped and I looked around the room and I was like, you're never gonna sleep here again. What should I take? Which clothes do I take? [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2604s) people who aren't brethren don't understand that we had church clothes and they were specific, like long skirts and dresses, and I left all of those hanging there. I knew I would never wear them again.

I took a couple of t-shirts and the only thing I owned was skirts, so I took a couple of skirts. I left all my scarves, I left them there on my dresser. I took my brush, I took my [toothbrush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2634s). I don't remember going down the hall and getting it, but I took that and I grabbed my journals and my bible and I said, okay, if I'm to do this, show me how I do this because I know when I walk out that door, I'm never walking back in. And he said, I'll show you.

So I opened the door and I ran for my car because I knew if they stopped me, I wouldn't be able to leave. By the time I got to my car and got in, one of my siblings had realized what was happening and came outside. And I just remember like the whole family coming up. They told my brother who's just younger than me to go to church and get one of the leaders or get somebody. They're like, go, like she's leaving, go get somebody to try to come back. And I remember saying to them, there's no point, I'll be gone before you get back.

My sister, this is the part that makes me tear up, she held on to my car door and begged me to take her. She was 11\. And I said I [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2706s). I don't even know where I'm going. I don't have a job. I'm losing my family. I'm losing my home. I'm losing my friends. I can't take you. I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what I'm doing. And as I drove away in my rearview mirror, forever etched in my memory, it's my parents standing on the porch with my siblings, and my sister collapsed in the driveway, screaming, take me, please take me. And my parents stood there crying. They knew I was never coming back.

And for a year and a half, every time I called, they'd hang up the phone on me. Every now and then, if my mom was home alone, she'd talk to me maybe 10 minutes, something like, and then she'd say, somebody's coming home, I gotta go. One time I called and they were having 3-day meetings or fellowship meetings or something and my mom's like, we're having meetings, like you can't call for the next few days.

I'm sorry, it's just, it's hard. It's been 23 years and it still hurts. And my family's all out and it still hurts. My family is torn apart because of the brethren. Several of my siblings don't talk to each other. My parents are divorced. The brethren ruined our family.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D2807s)

I think we're sharing the part, I just think that this is the part that you never get over.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D2813s)

No, you don't get over. You don't get over leaving the house that day. No. I mean, you know, you have like what, two or three dividing moments of your life? That's the first one. I mean, well maybe the second, the abuse was maybe the first. That's the second one. And like my wedding day, the birth of my child, like those are my days. Those are the memories that are ingrained. And when you told your story, Cheryl, I cried and cried and cried. I was like, the exact same thing happened to me. And I thought it was, I thought I was only one. And then I hear your story and other people that I'm friends with that are ex-brethren, I find out the reason they left is because they were sexually abused.

It doesn't matter if it's sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, psychological abuse, it's wrong. And [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2871s) think they're right and they don't do anything about it. And I think that's why these like conversations are very hard, but are so needed. That it's hard to just say to somebody, well I left the PBCC, I had to leave my family. It's not like, it's not like, Carman, would you say you go to a Baptist church? It's not like you just left that church and decide to go to a different one.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2897s)

No, this is...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2898s)

Your entire way of life. You lose your house. You lose your family. You lose your job. You lose your friends. I knew I walk out that door and the door is closed. I can never go back through it. I'd already lived it. I already knew what it was like. I had a brother that left.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2923s)

But even through all that pain, aren't you glad that you are on the outside now?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2928s)

Thank God. What I tell people is the fear of staying was more fearful than the fear of the unknown. Like my body, literally physically, my body was shutting down. I had so many anxiety attacks. I had stomach cramps. I was basically anorexic, bulimic, not because I thought I was fat, but if I ate something, it made me want to feel like I was going to throw up. So then I wouldn't eat and then you get hungry and then you eat too much so you throw up. Like it was just a vicious cycle. And I was [getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2974s) skinnier and skinnier and having all these health issues when the truth was I knew that I needed to seek mental health, like medically seek mental care. And of course that's not allowed. You can't go to a psychologist, it's evil.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=2997s)

I don't know why the brethren only allow their members to go to brethren approved psychologists and shrinks. Well, and that should be illegal.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3003s)

That should be illegal, but back then there was no such, yeah, no, no one was allowed to go to a psychologist. I think that's a new thing that Bruce Hales has allowed in because when John Hales was, it was that wasn't allowed during John Hales's rule. Yeah, yeah, but think about it, it's just a money-making scam. We know you need therapy, so we're going to tell you which therapist you can go to. I'm sure they tell that therapist the [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3033s) way you get to counsel current brethren is if you tell them that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is the only right place to be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3042s)

Yeah, these conversations are so healing amongst ex-members, right? Like I think that's why it's so important to have these kinds of conversations because when we witness and listen to you, to other people speak, we cry together, we laugh together. It's just so healing.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3061s)

Yeah, and my hope, I know people said after you went on James DiFiore, like how do you not want that person to go to jail? How do [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3073s) not, like we don't have a lot of, I mean, I think because we've gone through so much therapy, we don't have a lot of hatred left. I want them to change.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3080s)

Yeah, it's just, it was about the fixing that they need to do. I mean, Richard had a really good saying this morning. It was like, what was it? Clean up or clear out, you know? Like, if you're not going to clean up, then let's drop them off altogether on some part of the world, barricade it off, let them have their own little thing. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3103s) I mean, it would be fine to say that. Like, you think of any cult you've heard of that they had a little compound, but you and I know that these atrocities will still continue.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3115s)

Absolutely. Well, oh yeah, that's why I'm speaking up. That's why I feel like this podcast is so necessary. This has to stop. You cannot keep covering up [crimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3133s).

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3133s)

And we're allowed to, we are allowed to get angry. I hold anger against the church. I'm angry at them. Oh, because children were abused, exactly. And hearing these stories, hearing your story today broke my heart. Yeah, you know, because this is more kids that are being abused and it has to stop. And we're going to keep putting these stories out. And the listeners, thank you because that story was incredible today. And I know the listeners got a good sense of the level of abuse. Now this [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3163s) the level that we're talking about that goes on in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Yeah.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3168s)

And this is why it's so hard to leave. So those of you who have never been a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church member, now you understand. I lived it. I already knew what was going to happen if I walked out the door. And I still had to find the guts and do it. And I literally had nowhere to go. The people's house that I was friends with, they had told me that I could come back to their house that night. I literally did not know where I was going to be after that night. I did not have a house. I did not have a place to live. I knew that night I could sleep in their guest bedroom.

You know what's funny about it too, it was December [31st](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3221s), 1998\. They were having a New Year's Eve party. I didn't even know what a New Year's Eve party was. They had a full-on like big old New Year's Eve party, drinking everything. And of course it's Texas, they were in the pool and everything. Like I got there and they're like, you have to stop crying, here have a drink. And I'm like, this is so not what I need right now, but sure, I'll have a drink.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3254s)

Maybe it was just what you needed.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3256s)

They did not understand the irony of handing me a drink. Unfortunately, it was not my first drink. But what a good way to like, I mean, it was funny, right? Like it's like to be able to give you that kind of a celebration. Yeah, but to be able to tell me that celebration, yeah, yeah, you have a mic. It was, it was kind of funny. It was kind of ironic. It's like, here have a trick. Okay, I guess I will. So the rest is, the rest is history.

I mean, yeah, those [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3299s) few years were really hard. Even after my family left, after my parents left, they left a year and a half after I did and they took all of the kids with them. But even still, it's never been great. Like our family's falling apart. You know, the damage was just too great.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3325s)

Yeah, they have a lot to clean up. Like that is like a church, like the [damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3329s) and the extent of the evil that has gone inside there and what it's done to people's families. Like I think that's what I challenge listeners to think of is just think of like the family you have right now and what would happen if you had a sibling or you've got a daughter or child where all of a sudden that person is taken out and you never get to talk to them again. And but you still love them and you still want to talk to them. Like, it's just, it's such a horrific thing to have to [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3359s) through and then rebuild your life and come back.

I mean, we come back way stronger. I mean, let's not, let's give ourselves the credit of rebuilding ourselves because when you rebuild that, you rebuild it so freaking strong that nobody can come. I mean, my husband gets afraid of sometimes, I maybe sometimes get Richard scared. And especially in these females that come back, it's just like there's some like powerhouse inside us. It's just [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3389s), yeah, no, we're making change happen.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3393s)

Yeah, there's no more sit down and shut up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3397s)

No.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3397s)

No.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3399s)

Let's talk about, I actually had a listener suggest a subject that they wanted to talk about, okay? And it is the rapture. So let's talk about what the rapture is so the listeners know. The rapture is what the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church prophesies as the second coming of Christ when Jesus comes, takes only his friends and fucks off everybody else. That's just my atheist, but [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3429s) this rapture, okay? Taylor said it was gonna come before he died. It's gonna come, it's happening before I die. Symington comes along, no, no, the rapture's being pushed a little bit now. Jesus is gonna come before I die. Turns out he dies, Jesus doesn't come.

John Hales, John Hales pops onto the scene, I'm gonna lead the brethren into the rapture. Literally what he says, I'm gonna take the brethren into the rapture. It'll happen [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3459s) before 1999 or in 1999\. Didn't happen in 1999, gonna happen in year 2000\. 2000 comes and goes and in the end, John Hales dies and still no rapture. So if you're gonna start telling me, I'm talking to the members in there...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3478s)

Right now, Bruce Hales is going to take us to the rapture.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3481s)

Yeah, like come on guys.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3483s)

Where is he going?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3485s)

And I'm sorry, if anyone shows up in the skies right now, like in a light being or something, the first thing is not going to be thinking of Jesus. They're gonna, people are going to be like...

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3495s)

Aliens are here.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3496s)

Right, exactly. Worst case, Jesus coming in on the cloud, right? Fucking U.S. Air Force is going to shoot him down. You're in airspace, like what are you doing? Just saying. So this whole rapture thing, like they preach it, they ever since I was a kid, they would say these old guys would get up and they preach on Sunday that we're just around the corner. Like oh my goodness, like it is Armageddon is is tomorrow most likely. Yeah, well they were preaching that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3532s)

But tomorrow never comes. And it never will. Well, there's a sinister side to that because they have this saying in the brethren that, well, you just have to leave that to the judgment seat and everything will be put right in the end. And they actually use that as an excuse for covering up all these sins and misdemeanors. They say, oh no, we can't deal with that, we'll leave that to the judgment seat. And what they're really saying is we're not going to do anything about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3567s)

Well, let's bring these stories to the judgment [seat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3570s) called an actual judge.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3571s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3572s)

Well, yeah, exactly.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3573s)

But like you were saying, Cheryl, why is this systemic level of abuses allowed to continue? What I really think is they're not equipped to deal with it. None of them go to seminary. They don't, I mean, what they know of the scriptures is what they read. They're not trained at some college to be a priest or a minister or anything. None of them have any kind of, I think most [ministers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3603s) have some kind of like counseling training. They don't have any of that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3609s)

None.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3610s)

There, I mean, like in my dad's situation, most of them are 28 to 38-year-old kids. I mean, they may be fathers, they may have a young family, they don't know what the...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3627s)

We don't need these priests. They should be, people that have issues should go to counselors and those counselors are trained that if they're told about sexual abuse, they need to contact the authorities. Let's keep that very clear to any brethren members listening. If you act as a priest and you have heard of a sexual abuse of a minor, it is your legal obligation to go to the authorities.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3651s)

But they don't because there's some scripture, again, that they take out of context that says something about you're not supposed to sue your brother. I'm like, I'm not suing him. He committed...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3667s)

It's, let's get the police involved in every one of these things. They're the only people that's going to clean up the Plymouth Brethren is going to be the police.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3674s)

So I had a, I did meet with the police yesterday. I kind of give a little bit of an update of what I can give. It was a good lengthy conversation. It was lead investigator for Maple Creek. And we know after listening to Canadaland, those who have subscribed to Canadaland could get access to the second and third episode. And it's in the second episode where the journalists Jesse and Cherise actually phone the peebs. And I don't have a quoted word for word, but the gist is that the peebs are telling them that like no lead investigator or [RCMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3711s) have contacted them about the issues in Maple Creek yet.

So I'm here to tell you that you're going to be the last person that's contacted. That this is very much very actively being investigated. I had a very good conversation with the constable yesterday and we're going to have multiple meetings over the next little bit. It will be dealt with. It will be dealt with. And he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3741s) very reassuring. He understands the church the way we understand the church. He's done a lot of research. He understands what's happening in there, but he also knows that they need to be strategic on how they do this.

So all the people in Carman's letter will be addressed. Yeah, that it will be addressed at some point. Right now we're just dealing, my case of mine is, it's complex, right? So it's not, we're not just dealing with Alan, we're dealing with the places that Alan took me to, right? So we're trying to locate these people, who these people were. And then Carman's letter is a whole another layer on top of that that could easily [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3790s) a civil, like a criminal offense again with each one of those. So right for all the PBCC members that are watching this, there is an active investigation going on just because someone hasn't knocked on your door or hasn't called up the PBCC leaders and said, hey, we're actively investigating this, doesn't mean that it's put away.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3812s)

Y'all better hope that the rapture comes real fucking soon.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3818s)

So, talking about the police, I actually called the police myself in Texas. Laws are a little different in the United States. We have statute of limitations has long since run out on the abuses that were committed against me. The only thing I can do is make a statement. Because of the [laws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3848s), it criminally cannot go any further. But recently in the United States, it was signed into law that you can bring a civil case against abusers, that there no longer is a time limit on bringing a civil case. So for an example, just so people understand, everyone knows OJ Simpson, criminally he was not convicted of killing his wife. [Civilly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3879s), his wife's family brought a case against him and they won.

So, but we all know civil cases cost money. So that is the option that I have, or other people in the United States that are also in my position. They can, we could join together and get a lawyer and bring a civil, whatever you call it, class action lawsuit against the PBCC, but we all know that takes a lot of money. So I would be glad to be the first one to head that up and you know, go down that road. I just know I don't have that kind [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3922s) money.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3922s)

We're gonna get there. And I have to say this before I forget, if you've enjoyed listening to this podcast, please like and subscribe to our video because it helps the algorithms and it helps boost our show. Yeah.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3938s)

Please share it to everybody you know. So we have like, I want them to become famous for being a cult. Yeah, I want people to hear the name PBCC, RRT, UBT, whatever the hell they call themselves. I want people to hear those names or those initials and go, oh, that's that cult that lets child abusers exist. Oh, that's the cult that allows spousal abuse.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3969s)

Yes, yes.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3971s)

That's what I want them to be known for.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D3973s)

What a way to end the show. Perfect way to end it.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3977s)

We have a new theme song, though. We have to share our new theme song that I think it's Carman found it. Let's do this.

### [**Theme Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=3990s)

Mega church leader millionaires beg for donations for the private planes. Obediently preaching the prosperity gospel. God rewards faith with material gains. Big churches don't pay any taxes but took pandemic relief. That's pretty shady. Committing and concealing sexual abuse over many years is also very shady.

That's a bit of an understatement, really?

Big, big, big church is doing shady things. Why is it all we think, we think big church is doing shady things? You think that corporations go around your relative with the hayball elite? So why are we, we think church is doing shady things? Mega church leaders…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=4040s)

That is awesome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=4046s)

Yay\! That's a good way to end the show.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThnM6q8gHG4&t=4050s)

Lara, thank you so much for joining us. And I mean, our heart broke with you when you were telling your story. We all relate to it. But we really appreciate you coming on. And I am sure we will bring you on again because we didn't even get into some of the stuff we wanted to talk about. And we for sure, for sure, for sure will have you back on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DThnM6q8gHG4%26t%3D4068s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:
