## Summary

Imagine the strength of character instilled in this gentleman when at the age of 22 after being told he was of a reprobate mind our guest left the only life, family, and church he had ever known. Jim Clarkson described being ostracized, and isolated after priest’s lips failed to keep knowledge and he was condemned for the feelings he had and life choices he was about to make. Jim took us through his life- the shock and sorrow of being called to his dying mother’s bedside after 20+ years of separation, and yet the faith he has in an all loving, and forgiving God. It was a privilege to have Jim share his advice to any young person in a high control religious group- “seek out a support system.” Don’t settle in an unhappy life situation- surround yourself with people who care and seek to build you up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=5s)

Hello everyone, welcome back to another episode of Get A Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. I have Carman and Richard with me today and also a special guest, Jim Clarkson. So we are going to hand the mic over to Jim and let him introduce himself, where he's from and let us know his journey that got him to where he is today. So go ahead, Jim.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=32s)

Okay, I grew up in Chicago. I was part of the PBCC church there and grew up in a suburb of Chicago.

And when I was a child, my parents weren't real strict about us playing with the kids in the neighborhood. So I kind of didn't think anything differently about playing with them going into their houses, sometimes even watching television. My parents were pretty, you know, they weren't real strict about that like some of the brethren. So I kind of didn't never thought, oh, these are weird people or these are different people. It just they were just our neighbors. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=77s) when I was in high school my dad died in 1965\. I was 12\. And so my mom, instead of staying in our house, she moved into the city of Chicago. And I went to high school there. And I happened to meet another high school guy. 

And I was 16 at the time. I knew that as a child, I felt different. I felt like there were feelings inside of [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=107s) I couldn't quite explain because I didn't know what being gay was. I just thought I was weird. I thought there was something wrong with me. I kept it a secret, of course, because if I had told anybody, you know, they would have probably dealt with me. So when I was 16, like I said, I met this guy in high school. We end up having a sexual experience, but I was just so terrified of the feeling inside that I [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=137s) that I never did it again for four years. I didn't know about the gay world. I only knew this one individual. And so, and of course, I had to keep it a secret because I didn't want, I didn't want to get withdrawn from or have to leave my mom's house.

 So when I was 20, I got a job at a department store in Chicago. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=168s) I worked in the men's shirt department. And it's kind of funny, because I remember going home one day to my mom and saying, gee, those men are really friendly to me. They're always asking me, what am I going to do? What am I doing after work? And I always would say, Oh, I'm busy because you know, I had church every night. And I didn't really understand what was going on. Because I just thought it was that they're being friendly. And so I got invited to a Christmas party because it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=198s) during the Christmas season that I worked at the store. And I got invited to a party. And I noticed that there were no girls, young girls at the party. And like a stupid idiot, I, I turned to one of them. And I said, Well, where are the girls? And everybody just stopped talking. I guess they didn't know what to think of me. So then of course, by the end of the evening, I was kissing a guy. So it didn't [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=228s) me long to figure out. 

But I just look back on that. And I think, God, you were so green, you know, because I didn't have any, I had no gay friends in the church. I didn't know any gay people at school except for that one high school guy. So then I started learning about where the bars were and all the stuff that was going on. Of course, this was in the early 70s, which is when gay rights were starting to come to the forefront. You had [Stonewall.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=259s) And so I started going to bars, meeting people and that. But because I had been rejected, I felt rejected by my church and by my mother and by my family. I never wanted to get close to anybody because I felt like I don't want to feel that rejection again.

And I went through many, many years of loneliness, you know, just going out, partying, whatever, doing it. But I never really felt like I had a relationship that I could really say, oh, this is really love. And I think part of it was because I just hadn't really accepted and loved myself.

And in 1985, I moved with a boyfriend from Chicago to San Francisco and lived there. And I lived in San Francisco from 1985 to 2014\.

And over the course of those years, of course, there was the AIDS epidemic. And in 1989, I tested positive for HIV. And that really shocked me because at that point, most gay men were dying within one to two years of their diagnosis. And so my friend that I was with suggested I join a support [group.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=353s) So I joined it, it was called the healing circle. And they kept talking about responding to a higher power. And it got me thinking about,

you know, maybe I need to think a little bit about God and where I am in this epidemic. And I figured I was, I had a couple of years to live and that's it. So um somebody suggested, invited me to go to a church. 

And so I was resent… I didn't really want to go because I just felt like, oh is it going to be another one of those things, they're not going to accept me because I'm gay, they're gonna, you know, [kick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=399s) me out or whatever. But I did go and I'm still going today. It's a community church, it's not affiliated with any denomination. Um they're more into just empowering you and showing you the love of God. And it completely changed my feeling about Christianity, that it isn't about what you can't do, but it's about empowering you. So in the course of those years of trying to heal [myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=429s) in terms of my HIV and coming to terms with it, I changed a lot of things in my life. I wasn't promiscuous anymore. I wanted a relationship. And eventually, I met Doug in 1995\.

And he was just a wonder, he is a wonderful person. And the combination of going to church again and getting into a healthy relationship, slowly I came to love myself because I knew that part of the reason nothing ever worked for me was that I really didn't love myself. And I think the reason I didn't love myself was because I was gay and I knew [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=480s) the brethren, in fact I was told to my face before I left that I had a reprobate mind which means devoid of moral judgment. So that really, that's what set me back in terms of accepting myself. Um so the thing that the brethren, why they dealt with me was that when I have to go back a little. When I was 20, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=511s) came to visit my house. And they said that some girl in England who had visited Chicago claimed that I had tried to make sexual advances on her. And so I said, well, I don't even remember who you're talking about because it was years later.

And like a stupid idiot I said, how would I know that, who, this girl wouldn't stand out? Because I've had sex with a lot of people. And of course their eyes almost popped out of their sockets because you know, then they wanted to know, was it a girl? And I said no. And of course, that only left one other thing which was were men. So they shut me up and I didn't know what was going to happen. I was really embarrassed for my mother's sake because I figured if that all came out, um she would be humiliated. Uh but they called Mr. Symington who was a leader at the time and he said that he didn't want them to withdraw from me. First of all, I don't have, didn't have a father and they felt like let's try to keep it under the carpet. So they didn't really talk about it openly, which shocked me.

And I made a deal with my mom that I would stay in the churchas long as she let me go out occasionally with my friends. And she was cool and she agreed to that, which probably in hindsight when I left, she probably wishes she hadn't done it, but I probably couldn't have survived emotionally if I had been told, no, you have to leave right now. I was in college when I was in my 20s because I wanted to be a teacher. And you can't be a [teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=629s) if you only go to two years of college because they kept pressuring me to quit and I didn't. And I graduated and you know, I've been teaching quite a few years. But I think that the lesson that I learned from this is if there's anybody that's watching this from the brethren, if you feel that you're gay, you need to understand that God created us in your image, in his image. And that why would he [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=660s) a class of people who he would condemn and and say is, you know, immorally wrong? 

Because I'm a good person, it's just I, I didn't from the time I was a child, I just felt different. Nobody told me, oh Jim, you ought to be gay or oh, you ought to change your lifestyle. No, I didn't do, I mean, that's not just something you do. And of course the brethren wouldn't agree with that. They would say, you know, you're [morally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=690s) bankrupt, you're the devil. My mom wanted to me to go see a, uh to go to a psychiatrist to try to convince me not to be gay and I said, Mother, it doesn't work that way. So it's been a long journey. I spent many years like I said feeling very lonely but now that I've been with Doug since 95, and we've been married since 2013 when it was legal in the United States.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=722s)

Oh that's awesome. Yeah, yeah. And you were, so this was at the time when going, getting a university degree was still acceptable and they were weeding it out. And I think you had said to me on the phone that you were one of the, one of the last ones to finish up getting your degree while they were trying to push everybody to stop doing that.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=742s)

Right, right. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=744s)

Yeah. So what, when you, when you were getting ready to leave, like how did you,what were those priestly visits like at the end, right before you decided to actually leave? Take us through your leaving process when you actually left the Plymouth Brethren.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=761s)

Well, when they came to see me when I was 20,

I couldn't leave at that time because I knew if I left I would have to work full time to support myself. I knew I probably wouldn't finish college and like I said I made a deal with my mother to to stay in and so I continued to see my friends and do things outside of the brethren. So in a way when I officially left when I was 22, I wasn't like freaked out because I had already [established](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=796s) friendships.

But it was difficult because my mom was a widow. And I knew it was going to be really, really hard for her emotionally because my brother also left. So that would mean her two children, the only two children she had were gone. And that means death. Yes, you know. And so,

but I said to my mom, I said, Mom, I don't want to leave. But I, I cannot stay in, I will have an emotional breakdown. I said, there are no, I have no friends because everybody, Chicago had a huge split in 1972 when Taylor was caught in that bedroom with that woman. A lot of them left and then like my brother left when he was 19 and all of the friends I'd grown up [with,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=849s) they were all gone. So the only friends I had were the people in the outside of the brethren. So I knew as a gay person, there's no way I could have a gay relationship and stay in the church.

So at the very end, I remember I got a priestly visit from one of the guys. And he said to me, you know, Jim, if you ever want to get married, you need to be a man. Now, what was that? What was he really saying to me? I wasn't manly.

And so that pushed me over the edge. I just said these people are just sick. Yeah. Well, I just I said, that's it, Mother, I just I know I don't want to do it. I know it's going to kill you emotionally, but I just I can't do it. I can't give I can't stay another day. So I got an apartment on my own. And, and I have like I said, I had friendships. So it wasn't as brutal as some people that have left.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=916s)

And how did your mom, did you get to talk to your mom after you had left or what?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=920s)

Was, I did for a while. I would even visit her like once a week but then one day she just said, Jim, I can't see you anymore and I can't talk to you. So I, I know the mother in her that really killed her to have to say that because I had a very close relationship with my mom. Because like I said, my dad died when I was 12\.

And so you know, she didn't have anybody. I mean, she wasn't married at the, you know, because my dad passed away. So anyway, then that was really, really hard. I didn't see her again until shortly before she died. I got a phone call from my brother and he said, Mom's in the hospital. And so I flew out to Chicago and I went to visit her. And I remember walking into the [room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=976s) and just bursting out crying because the emotional shock of seeing my mom from when she was a vibrant person to this woman dying was really hard for me emotionally. And I remember her saying, Jim, will you please come back to the brethren? I said, Mother, there's no way I can go back. I cannot promise you that. So that was hard for me to to have to say that when she was dying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1005s)

Yeah, and I think that's the hardest thing about their whole separation. It's just, it's hard to describe to the listeners how the emotional roller coaster because we build this life on the outside and we we we stand our own two feet and we get to feel this freedom but yet there's just always this piece of us living this death of those people that are still alive. And so that when their death finally [comes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1036s) it's just this huge explosion of emotional, mental turbulence that, you know, we just don't want that day to come because we know we don't know how we're going to handle it. I've actually told my siblings that I like, I'm not going to go to my parents' death. I won't. I've said my piece, I will do it my own way and I'm not going to subject myself to that. And I also am not going to subject my parents to that. Um so I've made that very clear so they can prepare themselves for that.

Um but I can't even imagine the emotional torture that you went through having to walk in and witness, especially someone you were so, I remember you talking to on the phone with me and how close you were to your mom.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1079s)

Yeah. Yep. And the other thing is that when she did pass away a couple of weeks after I visited her, I didn't go to the funeral because to fly all the way from California to Chicago, and then I can't go into the room. I can't go into the brethren's room. And my brother did go out to the cemetery.

And apparently what he told me is this was back, like she passed away, I think it was almost 20 years ago.

They don't embalm them anymore. So they have to bury them very quickly after their death. And they put her in a cedar coffin and put her back of a pickup truck. And just that image, I just said to my brother, I cannot believe it just didn't seem like a dignified way to to honor somebody that had died. So I didn't go to the, I didn't go because I just emotionally, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1142s) brother said, I went to the cemetery, they wouldn't allow me to come up to the where the body is lowered into the ground. Um but they did, a few of them did come up to my brother to speak to him. Um but I just emotionally I, to face those people again, no, was, I just couldn't deal with it. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. 

And what's helped me to accept a part of my healing process besides going to church [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1172s) been that Doug has a family that's accepted me. And so when we get together for Christmas or Thanksgiving, um we have, I have his family. And so it's the first time since I left the church back in 1975 that I've had a sense of family. Yeah, yeah. And for them they just, they said, how could your mother do that? I said, I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1203s) think it was really my mother that wanted to do it. It's just fear and also because the funny part of it is my mother didn't grow up in the church. Her sister was nine years older than her. They lived in Vancouver when their parents both passed away. So my mother was an orphan and her sister took her in and she worked for somebody in the brethren. And so that's how she got into the church. So she [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1233s) for the first 12 years of her life she didn't grow up in that environment.

So it's kind of weird how my mom just got completely brainwashed.

Because I told her, I said, Mother, if you come out, I'll make sure that you're taken care of. But you know, she didn't have any friends. That was the thing. It's hard when you're older to make that transition from all the people you grew up with, your friends in the church, and then you have nothing and that's hard for people to understand that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1269s)

Yeah I can, I can really relate to what you're saying about having no uh self-esteem or sense of self-worth because I was very like that and it's it's very much part of the brethren's teaching and their their way of kind of breaking you is to is to make you feel worthless so you become dependent on them. And it was a very big lesson for me to learn [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1299s) I left the brethren to put some value on myself and actually like you say to love yourself. And I think it's part of their way they control people because someone who has no self-esteem becomes dependent on others for advice. They don't trust their own judgment.

And of course with you being gay it was, it would have been all the all the worse because the brethren have very, very strong feelings about that. Um and so you kind of had a double dose of um your self-esteem being and yourself being written off via them. So that's right. I can I can understand it taking a very long time to overcome that.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1345s)

Well I remember the last three-day meeting that I went to which is in Detroit, Michigan,and all the young people no one would talk to me. I was like this outcast from another world because I think what happened is I think word got out through the priest about my situation because they would not allow when we had a three-day meeting, they would not allow any young people to stay at our house because they would assume that if a young man stayed at our house, I was going to try to have sex with them. 

They don't understand [that,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1382s) you know, Now, you don't do it with just everybody, right? You have your standards or what you are attracted to. But I don't think they got that. They just assume that because I couldn't figure out why they wouldn't allow any young people to stay with us. And it's like I said, that between that priestly visit, where that gentleman said, if you want to get married, you have to be a man. And also the trait meeting thing I went [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1412s) at the end, I said, there's no way I can survive in this environment.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1418s)

Yes, yes. You'd always have been an outcast.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1421s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1423s)

And they don't look at it as that like you're created this way. Like they treat it like you have a disease. Right? Yeah. Like just that example you give about not let anybody stay with you, they don't look at it that like it's no different than a female standing beside you that's attracted to another man. Like it's it's it's you're you're no different than anybody else. Right? Right. They do, they look at it as it's this disease that's created from a demon.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1448s)

And well, they would say the devil. My mother even said that. She said, Jim, the devil has gotten a hold of your mind. And I said, Mother, he hasn't gotten a hold of my mind because this is how I feel. I didn't just wake up one morning and say, oh, I think I'll be gay today. No, it doesn't work that way.

But I was so terrified that it would get out. And I, unfortunately, I think it did because of my mother. And I didn't want the shame to be put on her. Like, what did you do, Jean, that allowed your son to be gay?

Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1487s)

Which is one of their tricks that is, that is so classic, you know, blame it on, you know, they use everything to blame each other.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1496s)

Right. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1498s)

If you were to meet a young person now and they, you know, they said they were in the same situation you were, what advice would you give them?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1509s)

Well I would tell them number one, you have to learn to love yourself because I don't think like I said, God has created us in his image. Why would he create people to be evil or have a reprobate mind or that they're sinful? I just don't understand how, why that just goes against my my feelings about God. And so um I would tell them to first you got [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1539s) learn to love yourself even if it's hard because the brethren are not going to accept it because you can't go on your journey. I spent so many years of my life being promiscuous, being drinking a lot, doing drugs, because I was trying to mask my feelings about my being gay. 

And you have to understand in the 60s, late 60s, early 70s, even in [America,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1569s) it was not that cool to be gay. I mean, you know, I actually had when I lived in the city, I had a group of guys chase me down with a baseball bat. And I was like, oh my God, you know, there's somebody out there wanting to kill me for who I am. So I was dealing with that as well. You know, the feelings of am I safe to go out at night, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1599s) because Chicago's a, you know, it has a lot of issues with crime. Yeah. And so um yeah. And so now I feel very safe. I live in a really nice neighborhood in like I said, it's across from San Francisco. And um but it took me a long time. And so I would say to some young person, don't don't go through your whole life hating yourself or being feeling less about yourself because [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1629s) feel different.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1630s)

Would you say, would you say that what really helped you leave then and transition the most was your your social circle that you created on the outside?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1641s)

Yeah. I think if I had not had any friends at all, I don't know where I would have ended up.Because I had no idea where gay, I had, I knew I felt different. But I didn't know where gay people lived until I started working at the store. And then I got introduced and I went to the party and then people were telling me where to go. And I went out with my friends and stuff.

 But if I had just left, like with my mom and dad didn't allow us to play with the neighborhood kids, I wasn't able to have friends in high school, I probably would have, I don't know what I where I would have ended up. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1681s) my feeling is that uh I've read, I read a book about a guy in Australia, not a gay guy, but just a gentleman who left the church and had never worked outside the brethren, you know, didn't have any context whatsoever. And just the sheer shock of what it did to him leaving. So I feel very lucky that I didn't have that to deal with.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1710s)

Yeah, but you had a lot of other stuff stacked up against you and I think so for those people that are watching this, we know that they watch from inside. I I guess what I want to inform you of if you're if you're in a situation that Jim was in is there's tons of LGBTQ communities. There's many, many support groups.

You can email us and if you don't have access to them, we'll get them for you. You let us know what area you're in and we'll find you numbers, we'll find you emails and we'll find you support groups that can help you.

Because I just firmly, firmly believe, I mean, I have very, very close friends with children that are part of that community and I see just even now in 2022 what we still are up against and I'm like, this is ridiculous. We were in 2022, this should not still be an issue. And I think it's important that this community has the voice that it needs to be able to still work through the kinks that [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1777s) still here today.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1779s)

They are. Yeah. I actually got let go of a teaching job at one of the schools because, you know, at the beginning of the year, they asked you to give money to the PTA, which is Parent Teachers Association. And I wrote a check and Doug's name was underneath my name. So they knew.

And the next thing I know, their parents are coming up to the school complaining that I'm harming the children, that I'm mean to the children. I said, okay, you bring those children in front of me and you have them tell that to my face because I knew they were lying. So this was not that long ago. We're talking about in the early 90s that this community where I taught, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1831s) this is a community right outside of San Francisco. It's not like an hour's drive or 200 miles away. And they, they literally drove me from that school. 

And so when they got got me out of the school, I told the principal or the superintendent, I said, if you fire me, I will have a lawsuit against you because I really know what the real reason why you're asking me to leave. Yeah. And so I because I had a [organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1862s) in San Francisco that was willing to have me get a lawyer for pro bono to defend me because I knew what the issue was. And so they never did fire me, but they could have if I hadn't spoken up. And that's the thing that I would really recommend to anybody in the church that is thinking of leading. Just remember, you have to stand up for yourself. You cannot let whether [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1892s) the brethren, whether it's the community, you have to because this is who you are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1898s)

Yeah.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1898s)

And I don't, I just want people to understand that I that I have the same needs and wants like everybody else. Right? I want peace. I want to have a good home. I want to have a job, be a good citizen.

So standing up for yourself, I think is really important. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1921s)

What, I mean, you've had a lot of years to digest what you went through in with the brethren. We like to ask this question to our viewer, to our guests. If you could walk back inside that meeting and you were given a platform to say something, what would you say to them?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1941s)

I say, why, if you, if you say yourself, you're Christians, why is it you cannot accept somebody? If you thought that there was something wrong with me, did you try to help me? Did you try to say, Jim, what is, what is, what, you know, what, how are you feeling? No, they just want to condemn you. And I would say to them, I just don't feel you're a Christian church. And that's what a lot of my friends will say to me, how can you say that's a Christian [church,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=1971s) and these are people that are just listening to the story and they're hearing me say this was a Christian church. So I would say to them, you're not a Christian church because you don't love one another and you don't show support. You know, they always want to kind of pride themselves that they're there for you. No, they're not. They weren't there for me. You know, I was, like I said, I lost my father when I was 12 [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2001s) of age and uh no one tried to come and comfort me or to try to be a father figure to me or anything. You know, it was just condemn, condemn, condemn.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2015s)

Wow, that's sad.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2018s)

That's so, so you're in Chicago goes through the kind of last years of JT Jr.'s life and then the beginning of the Symington era. And as you said there was a there was a big division. It must have been a lot of turmoil in the meeting because all sorts of things were going on. Can you tell us any any stories about what it was like in those in those years when all that turmoil around JT [Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2048s) was happening?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2049s)

Yeah, well, they tried to say it was the reason JT Jr. did that was to expose the undercurrent of those who were against him. And I'm like, why would you get into bed with somebody? I thought we were not supposed to have an appearance of evil. You know, and then here they are doing the very thing that they're preaching not to do. And um a lot of people in Chicago left, a lot. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2079s) like I said, most of the young people from maybe 18 to 25 to 30, they left. I would say three quarters of them left. That Chicago's a really small church right now because over the years young people have just said, nope, not gonna to stay here.

So, and of course they don't change their ways, you know, they don't sit and go, now what is it we're doing that is driving all these young people away?

No, they're not introspective at all. And from what I understand, it's getting stricter than when I was in, which is kind of opposite of what happens in the rest of society, right? As the years go, people get more accepting and understanding, and they get more liberal, but not that church, if you want to call it a church. I call it a cult. Yeah, we do too.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2135s)

I was very interested in what you said about being allowed to play with a neighbor's kids and go to their houses, because the reason that the brethren have their own schools now is not because they want to teach a different curriculum. It's purely to isolate brethren children from non-brethren children. Exactly. And it must, I'm assuming that it was actually helped you a little, the fact that you did have that [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2165s) and realized that your neighbors are just normal people. There's not this magical dividing line between the wicked world outside and the sort of pure saints.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2176s)

Right.

Exactly. Yeah, I grew up, you know, because where I lived was a very nice suburb of Chicago. And during the summer, I was out all day with neighborhood kids, just playing, riding bikes, playing games, whatever. And so I learned to develop those friendships that these are not weird people. These are not. I knew from a very young age, not only was I different, but I also knew that I was not going to stay in that church forever. I just knew it.

It just took a long time to be able to have the courage to do it because of what I had to face with leaving my mother, knowing she was going to be living alone and the emotional trauma that it was going to put through her.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2225s)

Yeah. I mean, it's very, very difficult for young people growing up in the church, in the cult today, because they have no interaction with people outside. Every single interaction they have is with other people within the cult. You know, whether it's at school, whether it's at work or whether it's at a church meeting, it's all the same people. They aren't even allowed to work for non-brethren businesses. And again, as you said, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2255s) you worked for a clothing store, you made friendships and met people. Well, that isn't the experience today of people growing up in there. So it makes it even more difficult for them to leave.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2265s)

Exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2269s)

Yeah, because they have no experiences outside of that church.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2271s)

And that's done by design. Think about it. They're not stupid. They know to control. See, they lost a lot of the young people in Chicago because we were all allowed to go to public schools.

And so you got experience. You sat down, you ate with people that weren't in the church and you're like, they're no different than I am. Yeah. You know, they're not weird. So I can understand why they're designing it that way. So if you don't have a Plymouth Brethren school, do they make them homeschool?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2305s)

Yes, they did. I think they now all, I should think nearly all of them would now have an actual physical school they can go to. Yeah, but it's still

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2315s)

just a Plymouth Brethren school.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2317s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they do a lot of distance learning. Like if you want to do a subject that It isn't available at your local school and you can use Zoom and so on to do distance learning. But they're still isolated. They don't get to interact with normal people. And so this enables the brethren to maintain this illusion that people outside the church are somehow dirty [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2347s) different and dangerous. Right. It's like me and well, like all of us, we all went to normal schools. And so that idea doesn't quite wash because we know from our experience that there are good people there.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2363s)

Right. But I would say to you, Cheryl, what I would recommend to a young person who feels this way, doesn't know where to begin, is to go, like you said, and find a support group in the area where they live. Yeah. Because through that support group, they're going to make friendships. Exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2382s)

Yeah. And there's one thing that you know, when you enter an LGBTQ community, they are the most heartwarming people, such down to earth. You could, it's like you've known them forever.

Everybody in those communities are so accepting because what, of what they've been up against. They are the most friendliest communities I've ever met.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2404s)

That was the first time when I realized when I was 20 and I started going out and making friendships with other gay men, that was the first time I didn't feel like a freak. Like there wasn't something really wrong with me mentally, you know, because I felt like God was going to punish me for what I had done. That's why for four years even though I had others that came on to me, I didn't react to it because I was terrified of that feeling [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2435s) being um, you know, that God was going to punish me. Yeah, yeah.

And that's what the brethren do. That's part of their control, is to say if you do this, you're turning your back on God. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2451s)

And if anything bad happens to you that's the first thing that they did, well you know, what do you think they

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2459s)

would, what do you think they would say if they knew I was HIV positive? They'd say, you got punished. He punished you. That's why you got it. Yeah. And that's why

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2468s)

yeah. You can hear it when you know they're gonna watch this and that's going to be the thing that they say, oh, well, that's why he got HIV positive. Like no, that's what happened back them. Right? It's that is the biggest brainwashing that everybody in there has to overcome. God does not punish you. God does not punish you. God is an all-loving God. Right? He doesn't come and punish you for every little thing you do. That that is the brethren [indoctrination,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2499s) that's what they brainwash you to think.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2502s)

And you know, I go to a, within the church that I go to, I go once a week to a Bible study. And it's a group of people, there's about 12 of us, we get together every week in somebody's home. And I did it because I wanted to form some friendships in the church, right? I didn't want to just go and then leave, you know, go to the service and then leave and not talk to anybody. So um and that just changed everything for me in terms of just [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2533s) it's good because I get to have fellowship with other people who have a love of God. They are not sitting there condemning me for whatever I do. You know, it's about empowering each other and trying to live a good Christian life.

And doing good for others, whether it's volunteering or like I'm involved in, I do cooking for the church. They do these dinners like once a month where members of the church can come. And I'm not the only cook. There's a whole group of us. But it's a good way to feel and understand what Christian love is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2573s)

Yes.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2574s)

As opposed to you go to church to hear condemnation, and what you can't do and all the rules that you got to live by. And think about it, what are all those rules? Do you find those rules in the Bible?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2586s)

No. And did you feel that you had to relearn the Bible all over again? That it was like reading a whole different book all over again in through the eyes of what Christianity should be? Right?

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2598s)

You know that one, that one verse that they use for their reason for separation is withdrawal from iniquity. Yeah. It's like who isn't a sinner?

Including them. And I listened to your story and I listened to that uh I forget the lady's name that was talking about her child abuse. And I think to myself, what is that if that's not committing a sin? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And yet they profess to be so sanctimonious and holy. It's just a facade. Such a facade. And that's what a young person needs to understand if they have that feeling that they feel that they're [attracted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2640s) to the same sex is to say you're not going to get it by staying in the church because that you're never going to be able to act on that. Right? At least I hope you wouldn't. Um but getting away from the church, you're allowed to then be the person that you were created to be.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2661s)

Exactly. That's so beautifully said. Yeah, I've got a, I've got a story about um the way the brethren, you know, if someone's sick, they will kind of um say, well, it's because you've done something wrong or God is punishing you. And and it's about um it's about a guy um in the locality where I grew up who took the lead and he was a big important man. He used to take three-day meetings and fellowship meetings and he was very, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2691s) judgmental. And if anything happened to anyone, he would get up in the ministry meeting and he would make it quite clear that, you know, God is speaking to you in this and this is why this has happened. And anyway, when he got to an age of about, I would say, in his late 50s, he suddenly and very unexpectedly went down with kidney failure, very serious kidney condition, and he [ended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2722s) up on dialysis. And of course, everyone is thinking but not daring to say, well, what have you done wrong, brother?

And then he he comes out with this story uh which he put around through his kind of supporters and his children. He didn't quite have the cheek to say it himself, that he was actually suffering on behalf of the locality because of certain things that had been done in the place in the past. So he was suffering vicariously. It wasn't because of anything he had done wrong and I don't think he pulled the wool over anyone's [eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2762s) except his own. And yes, that was the condition he died of.

And another story on the same line is my mother who was the most blameless person you could imagine. I mean, she was a very fervent Christian but she was also a very, very kind, very kind-hearted lady. As she always took care of like older people in the locality who were lonely or you know, she would have them around for the day and feed them. The most blameless person you could imagine and [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2800s) got a cancer, quite a serious cancer. 

And I this was while I was still in the brethren, I went around to see her when I got the news. And she was sitting with her head in her hands saying, she said, Richard, I what have I done wrong? What have I done wrong? And I thought that's just terrible, you know, on top of the stress of having this cancer, she's beating herself up sort of reaching through her life trying to find [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2832s) she has done wrong to to deserve this. Um and you know, she actually made a good recovery but it's just such a terrible misrepresentation of God to to think like that, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2847s)

They just miss the boat of compassion. Right? They just miss that boat. It just flies right by them. You know, like to me when you think of Christianity, the first thing you should think of is compassion, love, gratitude, a landing pad.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2869s)

Right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2870s)

Right? That's that's what should come to your mind. And when you think of the the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, none of those come to us.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2880s)

No.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2881s)

It doesn't. Right? I and I guess I just I I I know my parents probably watch all this and I I have to say like I just that's what's missing. I just where's the compassion?

And they might say, oh well we have it now. But do you really? Do you really have it? Because that compassion shouldn't just stop at the the door of the church.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2908s)

Right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2909s)

Christianity is a way of life. It's not something that just happens inside a building. It's not something just happens inside your home. It's a way of life.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2919s)

Well, that's why I love where I go to church now. Like I said, it's a community church. It's not affiliated. We don't take any orders from hierarchy. Um but it's a very driven to get people to give service to others, you know, whether it's in the community or feeding or whether it's giving. We're connected with a church [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2949s) Africa that's a Christian church and people fly over there and we have a relationship with them. But it's from Malawi, which is a very poor country. And one of the things that I remember them saying about these people is that they're very poor, but they're so grateful. And their lives are so dependent on prayer and thanksgiving to God [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2979s) every day that they're alive. And I'm thinking, I never got that feeling from being in the Plymouth brothers. No.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=2986s)

And you think of what, I mean, now with Bruce Hales, I mean, he's so fixated on money. It is money, money, money, money, which is what has flooded out. If anybody did have compassion in there, right, because it's so it's so money orientated. Right? thought the love

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3003s)

I thought love of money was a root of all evil. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3006s)

Yeah. Well, it doesn't stop them from buying million dollar mansions left right and center there. Like I guess for me, I think that's literally where where it has gone. Right? It is not no longer a Christian church. It is it is a cartel. Yeah, it's just a business. It is very much just a business. And so I don't have an issue with that. I don't know if Mr. if Bruce Hales wants to have a business and call it the Plymouth Brethren Christian business, by all means you go ahead and do that. But do not [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3037s) the word church in behind that and call yourself a church and have a charity status. Uh-uh, that's where, that's where we draw the line is you created, you've created my parents as your slaves Bruce. Right? They and I don't want, I don't like that and I'm on the outside and I can see that. 

So I will keep on calling this out until those slaves wake up and realize that you know it they're just handing their money over to you. I guess today [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3067s) was today was a really fired up day for me in the sense that I have no fear over Bruce, no fear. And I publicly, publicly want to go forward and be like, I invite you to come and have a conversation with me. I don't care who, whoever wants, let's have a panel of us. But if this is a Christian church and this leader truly cares about those that used to be in there, he'll answer our call. And I I want, I want a conversation with him. I want to sit down and have a conversation with him.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3096s)

Well, let's, well I know I

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3098s)

could pardon, let's have him on the podcast. Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3103s)

Let's make this worldwide. He can come on here and he can have a conversation with as many ex-members as he wants. And let's start reframing this business back into a church.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3115s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3117s)

That's where I came to today. It was just a fired up morning for me.I mean, you get enough people messaging you, you get enough heart, like the stories just break my heart to the point where you have to sit back and you're like, okay, so what can we do with this? How do we fix this? Because this is something that needs to be fixed. It has to be fixed. And

I mean, he's, we know he is the one that has the power. He has the control. So let's sit down and I have I I have no, I'm not there to sit there and tear him down. I want to sit down and have an actual true authentic grounded conversation on how we can fix these issues. 

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3162s)

And if he is a true Christian, he'll come. Look at James Taylor Jr. He was an alcoholic. Yeah. Well, Bruce is too, I think. Oh, very much so. So I mean right there, that that tells it all. What, how can they be the man of God if they're alcoholics? They're not even dealing with their disease because they enable it. You talk about these young people being offered alcohol at a young age. So what are you doing? You're creating alcoholics. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3192s)

Yeah.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3193s)

And it's just really sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3195s)

He's so smart with how he has this set up. Right? You can tell that he's very much got this business mind. He knows how to keep his flock where it needs to be. He I mean, they have a lot of um freedom inside there now. Right? They've got their their TVs, their laptops, their TVs. Seriously? TVs. Yeah. But I mean, yeah, but

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3217s)

they're not they're not they're not hooked up to cable though. There's no

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3220s)

cable but he's given them a lot of freedom inside there. But inside that freedom he gave them, he made the iron walls that much thicker. So he knows, he knows what he is doing. Right? He isolates the kids into their own school. He's got trackers on their phone, on their laptops. So even though that they're completely oblivious to this freedom. And my mom spoke to me about this freedom. Cheryl, you've got to come back now. It's so different. Bruce Hales [understands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3251s) the young children so different than any other leader. You've got to come back.

And I'm on the outside looking, but Mom, like you don't realize that he just added 20 million feet of electric fence on the outside that you guys haven't witnessed. You don't see that.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3269s)

Mm-hmm. And that's why he doesn't allow them to go to schools and to work in outside business because then you control people and that makes it even more difficult to leave. Yeah. Right? Because if you've never had an experience, you don't know where to begin. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3289s)

And then I was just going to say that for anybody outside watching this episode today, look at the people around you and if they're being isolated and if they're being separated and kept in you know just this one small um path, you know, check on them. They might they might need somebody to reach out to them. You know, it's so dangerous when you isolate kids and try to put them on a tiny little path that doesn't necessarily conform to [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3319s) child. You're looking at dire consequences for that. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3323s)

100% Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3325s)

And for those people who feel that they're different and you don't know how to label it gay, you don't know how to label it the way that you're feeling, I'm actually going to, I am going to just go ahead and research and get a whole bunch of numbers, um try and cover as many countries and stuff that I know that listen to us and put them at the end of this podcast. So when we when we send it out it will have a list. Um yeah, I I really feel I need to do that because I'm just gonna cut out anybody having to contact me and just put the cut the [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3355s) numbers there. I know that there are people in there, even fathers that are in there that have asked, Cheryl, I know that this is hard on you, but it's harder on us that are trapped inside. 

These people, there's, we I just want you to start leaning in and try having conversations with one another inside the church because I can guarantee you you're going to find the group of you that are all thinking the same thing but nobody's [talking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3386s) I'm getting the conversations and I can't really do a whole lot from out here. I need you guys to have this conversations inside while we're trying to um I guess create this runway for you to be able to leave with yourselves intact, your business is intact, your family's intact. You should never have to leave and leave behind your business that is your legal right to keep a hold of your business, to keep a hold of your family, to keep a hold of your children. Bruce Hales cannot take that away [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3416s) you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3416s)

And then stand up and say, we are not going to stand for this until people say, you know what, Bruce, you're not taking my business. You're not taking my farm. You're not taking my family. Until people stand up and stand in his way, it'll continue.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3434s)

Yeah, go ahead, Jim.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3435s)

But you know, a lot of that fear and not leaving besides having to give up your business is the fact that even if you try to fight it, you're going to have to get a legal, you know, and that can be very expensive.

And you're talking about all the brethren having all this money, they can spend whatever they have to, to try to fight it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3456s)

Yeah. They're very, very big on using big lawyers to intimidate people. The thing I would say is that a lot of it is what I call paper tigers. You'll get these big letters from lawyers. But in fact, when you read through it and analyze it, they're just trying to intimidate you. So there are ways to make sure that you can leave with your business intact. Act so you might need to quietly get legal advice well [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3487s) you leave to make sure that all the paperwork's in order so they don't have any hold on you when you finally make that step.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3495s)

Right. And their their bark is way worse than their bite. There what I really want to stress inside there right now is that there is enough stuff happening outside here, there is enough evidence that is stacked up against them right now for you guys to start standing up and creating movement inside there. You can.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3515s)

Well, I hope it collapses. I really do. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3519s)

I think we'll have another Aberdeen. I don't think it will happen like Aberdeen because it's so business orientated now, but I do believe, I 100 percent believe that that the same kind of thing will happen. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3535s)

It happens like every 40, 50 years. I mean, the last big split was 72\. I don't know if anything's happened since because I don't really, this is the first time I've had any contact other than my brother with any of the church people because when I left, I left. I didn't try to keep in contact. They didn't try to keep in contact with me. So I just don't know what's going on, you know, as far as a lot…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3562s)

And I did the same thing. Right? For 30 years I never kept in contact with anybody but a couple people here and there. Um I left and I tried creating my new life. Right? I think I think that a lot of people did that and are now realizing the opportunity that's being presented. I think this is completely being divinely guided. I think that this landing pad has completely been opened up for us. Um I know the time is now. It's just a matter of us all working [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3592s) and helping those inside realize that the fear feels bigger and worse inside you than it really is.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3603s)

Right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3604s)

When it's just what you said, Jim, when you learn to love yourself and learn to love what you were created for, you'll be able to stand up and challenge this and there'll be a lot of support behind you. God will support you.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3619s)

And you know what, if I was speaking to Bruce Hales, he could call me all the names in the book. It wouldn't change how I feel about myself because I know that he has no power over me, none. Like you said, I'm not afraid of him. No, I have no fear. I have no I no, no fear. But I don't think he would ever talk to a person like me because he would just figure I'm so evil that he wouldn't even want to [talk,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3650s) which is fine. I don't really care, but I just think that's how he would be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3655s)

But he, this is what I'm putting out to him is that you are, you can, you console your, consider yourself the elect vessel, the man of God of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in 2022\. It is your responsibility as the man of God and elect vessel to make sure that that which has happened in your past has been taken care of. The reason why the past is barking at your guys's door right [now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3685s) it was never cleaned up. This has never been cleaned up. I'm not an evil person. I have not an opposer. I have nothing against you, Bruce Hales. What I do hold against you is what you are doing with your power.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3699s)

Right, exactly. Right. Because it's not Christ like. No. There's nowhere in the Bible does it say to leave your children, your parents, your cousins, everybody that you've known just because you look at life in a different way or that you have different set of lenses that are looking at life a different way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3721s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3727s)

Well, it took a long time to come to that, let me tell you. Long time. But you know what? It's how you end that matters. And the fact that I found happiness and that I'm happily married and to me all that pain and grief is behind me. And I look forward and I'm enjoying life now. And I'm very grateful. I mean, we had a sermon a few weeks ago, just before our [Thanksgiving,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3757s) which is in November.

And he talked about being thankful. And he quoted a verse where it talks about being thankful for the things that we have in life. Whether it be our health, whether it be our home, our you know, safety, uh just living a good Christian life to be thankful for that. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3786s)

It's so beautiful to have a story like yours come on from so long ago and to see where you are today. You're such a beautiful soul. I felt that when I talked to you, I was like, got off the phone and I just was, my cup was so full from just talking to you and feeling the compassion in your voice that I knew we needed to have you on. I wanted those inside the brethren to hear you, to hear your story of [someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3816s) that was able to overcome everything that you overcame, leaving behind a mom that was, had nobody else with her just everything that you had to sacrifice yet look where it got you. It gave you your freedom. It allowed you to actually walk and be exactly who you were created to be.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3836s)

Exactly. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3838s)

We're so grateful you came on Jim. Thank you so much for coming and telling your story. Um you're welcome on here anytime. We would love to have you back again and…

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3850s)

It's so good to talk with the rest of you and I, I've been watching all the podcasts and it's just really, it makes you realize you're not in this world alone in terms of how you feel because like you said, no one on the outside, they just don't get it. They just think, I was always ashamed to admit it because I didn't want people to look at me as some kind of a weirdo, especially when I was in high school. I didn't want anybody to know about the brother because I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3880s) want to be perceived as being some kind of a weird kid. Yeah. And and that's how the brethren make you feel that if you are not separate from them, then you are, there's something wrong with you. And so I'm just grateful that I've had a chance to and I'm looking forward to meeting other people

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3901s)

Yeah.

### [**Jim Clarkson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3901s)

in the group.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGeZzqK0qe4&t=3902s)

Well, I'm sure your story will open up a lot of doorways for others and for that we're very grateful.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
