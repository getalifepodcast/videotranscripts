## Summary

Diversity is the key to the "Get A Life" podcast's success.  Persons who escape from the "penguin colony" uniformity of the PBCC radiate out colorfully in all directions as their real self emerges from the mold.  Meet John Beresford and his sister, Ruth Beresford.  Born in St. Austell, Cornwall, in the extreme rural southwest corner of the UK, they were cruelly cast out at a young age and left to fend for themselves.  This podcast is an extraordinary story of both tragedy and joy as these siblings found their feet in the real world.  Former members from the UK will know many of the persons who play a part in this story, including the notoriously fishy Caleb Furse, and the dashing bachelor, Kenny Barltrop.  We hope you enjoy listening to this podcast as much as we enjoyed making it!

## Transcript

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast: Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=33s)

There we go.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=34s)

Hello everyone, and welcome to today's episode of Get-A-Life: Ex-Cult Conversations. It promises to be a very interesting one. We have two special guests, very interesting characters here. We've got Big John Beresford from St Austell in Cornwall, way down at the south end of England. And we have his sister, Ruth Beresford, from the beautiful village of Birmingham in the Midlands. [So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=64s) Ruth, start us off telling your story for us, please. We're really looking forward to it.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=71s)

Yeah. Well, I was born nearly four years after John. Born into the Brethren. I was sort of not allowed to do anything till we're baptised, so had this lovely business of being fully immersed baptised, but I don't remember it.

I remember sort of being the piggy in the middle because I had a younger sister, we had a younger sister that was born 16 months younger than me, and she was born with spina bifida, so the attention was quite soon taken off us two and we were sort of shoved aside and my sister was the focus.

Growing up, we were always the outsiders. Of course, there was the one main family down there, and we weren't related. So because we weren't related, we were very much shoved aside. We were the poor lot, we had no money, so we were made to feel that we were the outcasts and the poor people of the meeting.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=155s)

This was Birmingham, was it? Birmingham meeting?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=160s)

No, this was down in Cornwall.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=162s)

Oh, you were born down in Cornwall?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=163s)

I was born down in Cornwall, yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=166s)

She's Cornish through and through, really. She tries to say she's not. Strange woman, strange woman.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=174s)

Growing up, I suppose to some extent we were both very much rebels. We were always into trouble. I had the headmaster's daughter in my year at school, so everything I did wrong got back to her daddy, and so daddy came and gave me a good telling off again. I'm in trouble, I got trouble at school, I got a bad mark at school, I didn't behave in the dressmaking class, I misbehaved. It all got back.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=214s)

You sound so repentant about it too.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=219s)

Yeah, I don't know, I was like fifteen Hail Marys, yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=222s)

Growing up was hard because my sister spent a lot of time in hospital. She was in and out of hospital, had quite some severe operations. I spent every holiday growing up, from as far back as I can remember, in Walthamstow with my auntie and uncle in Enfield.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=252s)

London, that's London, yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=254s)

Yeah, I loved it because they treated me better. They were more loving than my own parents. I always felt in the way. I was always treated like the slave. By the time I was eight, I was doing the household's ironing, and if I didn't do it right, I got a beating.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=278s)

And you had to do it again, the whole lot. He would screw it up and make her do it again. He was 60 when I was born.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=289s)

He was 64 when I was born.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=293s)

Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=294s)

And 65 when my sister was born, yeah. Mother was in her 30s when they married.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=301s)

Yeah, so he was an old age pensioner before they got married, almost like, you know, mail-ordered bride job, nearly one. Oh dear.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=311s)

But I know the feeling.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=321s)

At 13, my mother pulled me out of school to help decorate the living room. We were having a cup of tea and one day she just suddenly said to me, she said, "I broke my heart once I found out I was three months pregnant with you because we didn't want you."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=338s)

Terrible.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=342s)

And I turned around and said, "Oh, is that why you don't love me then?" I said, "Because you both hate me, I know you do." "Oh no, it's not like that." I locked myself in my bedroom for four days and I came down at nighttime to eat. I'd raid the cupboards. I wouldn't speak to anyone.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=362s)

Great booze cupboard as well.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=363s)

Well yeah, oh that's one thing I knew where it was. You didn't, she hid it from you. I knew where it was.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=375s)

It caught me out.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=376s)

When I went to stay with my auntie and uncles, I was given an envelope to hand on to them, but I didn't know till I was in my teens that my auntie and uncle were being paid to have me. Which I knew then that they were paid to get me out of the way. They didn't want me.

There was a sister in the Brethren that John used to go and stay with in St Ives when he was very little, and I didn't take a lot of notice of what she said until I was 16, when it really hit me. All she kept on saying was, "John was such a lovely boy till you came along." The last time she said it, I was 16\. I had to walk away because I had my fists clenched at my side. She was 65 at the time, and I really wanted to punch her face in. All I wanted to say [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=447s) "Did I ask to be born into this shit?" Nobody wants me. Nobody cares. Nobody would give a shit if I jumped off the harbour wall and killed myself.

But I knew I'd miss my sister, even though she was disabled. We had some great times together. We were known in the community. I used to ride on the back of her electric wheelchair.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=473s)

You could hear them coming from down the road, they'd be giggling. And we'd say, "Oh God, the terrible two are here."

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=482s)

She had an electric wheelchair and because we lived a mile from St Austell Bay where we grew up, I used to put an electric wheelchair on manual and I used to push it down to Charlestown Harbour. We used to sit in the harbour and have an ice cream together for a bit. And then I'd put the wheelchair back into motor and I'd ride on the back and we'd ride home. The amount of people that used to toot and wave as we [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=513s) back up the hill. Those are the only happy memories I remember from growing up, spending times like that. Living in the house was awful.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=525s)

That's really sad.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=528s)

He used to lock Ruth in. They'd send me off to school and he would lock, because it was the old-fashioned door key, the big long keys, and he would lock her indoors and make her do the housework. And while I'd gone to school, then when it was time for me to come home from school, he'd unlock the door as if Ruth had got home before me. And she was told not to tell me, but you told me in the end and it all got out. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=570s)

So you were really the family slave then?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=573s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=574s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=575s)

I had to do all the gardening and cleaning, anything that needed cleaning, and get the coal in for the fire and chop the logs, you know, all that sort of stuff.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=589s)

Yeah, but I was the family slave. But my mother, apparently, her mother didn't want any girls, she only wanted boys. So it was almost as if I was a no-go because I was female. But my sister was welcome because she brought the money in, because she was disabled and they had extra benefits.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=613s)

Oh, I see. Yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=617s)

They got a free washing machine, free tumble dryer and all. Not long before we left, wasn't it? Yeah. And they were like, "Oh, we got this lovely new washing machine." I'd rather not be here.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=633s)

Well, it was almost as if they were proud that she was disabled. Yeah, but her character was absolutely wonderful. She never complained about anything. She was completely paralyzed from the waist downwards, and her character was lovely.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=654s)

She was really bright as well. She could add up a long list of numbers in her head before I could put them in on a calculator. Wow. Yeah, she was amazing. And she used to get it right and I would get it wrong. I would end up trying to hurry up.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=676s)

Yeah, yeah. But she would crochet and I would knit, and we would see who could use a hundred-gram ball of wool up the fastest.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=689s)

Click, click, click, click, click, them all gone. They're off. Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=694s)

But we weren't allowed to laugh. If we were laughing, my dad would shout at us to tell us to shut up. And so, you know, we shut ourselves off in the end. I spent most of my teenage years upstairs in my bedroom. If they knew how many books I'd got, they'd have been quite surprised. I'd read a Mills and Boon book a day.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=728s)

Wow. Yeah, that was the only resort, wasn't it? I mean, books kept me alive because what else could you do in the bedroom? Exactly, yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=739s)

You could have a television on your bed and a cassette player on your bed.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=750s)

Until my friend went roaming through my drawers and found Donna Summer. "What's this?" Oops.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=768s)

We had all the Beatles and all that stuff, didn't we?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=771s)

Yeah, back in the day. And we used to come home from the Saturday meeting, and me and John used to disappear down the pub.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=784s)

Good for you.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=784s)

But they did find out about it. Then they would lock us in because he had the key to the door, and they were the old-fashioned doors so they could lock us in. But in the end, I got wise to it and I managed to adjust my bedroom window so we could climb out of the bedroom window, crawl along this piece of wood I screwed to the wall. Then we'd hold on to the drain pipe, and then we would go on to the shed roof and sort of slide and climb down the shed roof. We did have a ladder put there at one point, but they found out why the ladder had been moved. So we then had to make another way to get out. But I used to lock my bedroom [door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=846s) from the inside and then we'd go out the window.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=850s)

And then you'd have to get back in the same way.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=853s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=854s)

But the trouble is, after you've been on the old sauce all night...

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=858s)

And I'll tell you what, the amount of skirts and knickers that I came home with great big tears in because I'd been climbing.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=869s)

Yeah, we used to have to climb over the back fence, didn't we? Because he used to shut the gate. Used to bolt the gate.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=881s)

Well, the neighbours knew what was going on because they would allow us to sneak in. I used to go next door and watch telly with the kids. And when it came, when we got shut up, I can't remember whether we got shut up or withdrawn from, it all happened so fast.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=902s)

We were shut up first.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=907s)

But during that first summer, I was 16, I turned 17 that summer, and right opposite was a carpet shop. In the summer, my mother used to leave the front door open, and because I spent all my time in my bedroom, my mother spent all her time screaming up the stairs at me. When it came time, you know, we'd been withdrawn from, the guy opposite turned around and said, "The bottom bedsit's coming free next month. You can move in." He said, "I'm not going to ask you a down payment. All I'm gonna ask you to do is go sort out the rent." [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=949s) said, "I've heard enough of your mother screaming at you. It's too much."

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=953s)

Wow. This was over a B-road, like a fair good-sized road.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=959s)

Yeah, so was the whole family shut up and withdrawn? Yeah. The whole family.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=967s)

Yeah. They got a solicitor's letter on me to get me out. Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=976s)

He had a letter from the bailiffs.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=977s)

It is here somewhere in this house. I have seen it recently. No, not the bailiffs, the solicitors.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=988s)

I thought it was the bailiffs. No, I had one from the solicitor's letter. Oh, okay. Because that's what Fergie told me, that I was going to get a letter from the bailiffs to throw me out if I didn't move.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=995s)

So your parents wanted you out so that they could go back to the Brethren, is that the situation? Okay, yeah, okay, wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1004s)

So did they keep your younger sister then?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1008s)

Yeah, yeah. No one else would have been able to care for her.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1012s)

She didn't let anyone, she didn't allow anyone else to help take care of her. So it was as if it was her burden, yeah, to push us, to keep us aside, you know.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1031s)

Sorry, very small meeting.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1034s)

Small meeting, okay.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1035s)

Yeah, there were three main families.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1044s)

And the Baileys, before all the Glazebrooks moved up from St Ives.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1051s)

Yeah, there were four families. And they were all, they were a big family. And Mr. Bailey was quite elderly. He was a nice guy. I got on well with him. He owned a business that he used to sell stuff to the tin mines back in the day. And he gave me a part-time job after school and Saturday afternoons. He was nice, he was an elderly chap, but he was really nice. Mr. Bailey, his daughter is apparently over your way I think now, Christine Bailey she was called. That was her maiden name, but she's married someone else now, [moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1102s) away. Gone abroad.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1104s)

She married quite late. Yeah. I think both her parents had passed away before she married.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1111s)

Yes, definitely. Because they lived on Porthpean Road, they did. Lovely. Yeah. The wife, Mrs. Bailey, she was the one who used to bake all the bread every Sunday morning.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1129s)

Right. Yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1130s)

Yeah, and she used to buy the old bottle of plonk for the table, you know.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1138s)

Oh yeah, I had my first major experience with that a couple of months ago. My friend had bought a bottle of port, and I hadn't tasted port since. And when I took that first sip of that port, it took me straight back into breaking bread, being a child breaking bread. It was really quite scary.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1164s)

Yeah, it's very distinctive, isn't it? Very distinctive flavour. I mean, same with me. If I ever occasionally get a bottle, when you drink it, it always takes you right back, doesn't it? Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1175s)

It's like seeing a woman with a headscarf. Yeah, I was in a shopping centre with my eldest daughter, and there was this woman with a headscarf in WH Smith, and I just said to my daughter, "There's a peeb, I'm going." And she said, "Mum, she doesn't know you, for heaven's sake." I said, "I don't care, I'm going."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1201s)

Yeah, no, they haunt you. They really do haunt you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1207s)

So how old were you then when you left, when they got rid of you?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1211s)

17. Well, I was 16 when we were withdrawn.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1214s)

Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1215s)

16, and then I turned 17 a couple of months after.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1218s)

I was just gone 21\. Yeah, because I was working for Ken Glazebrook. The Glazebrooks were down in St Ives, which is an hour further on, right at the very tip of England. And there were only two, three families down [there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1249s) One of the old guys passed away, and so then Ken and his wife, she came from Guildford, Ken's wife did. Esther, I can't think of her maiden name. Yeah, Ken's brilliant. His dad got thrown out for lying years and years ago. Yeah. His company went bankrupt.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1278s)

Right. Yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1279s)

And someone else found out about it through some website, no, way before websites were invented, something or other, this other pig found out about it and dogged him in. And he told lies, Mr. Glazebrook told lies about it. So they slung him out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1303s)

Wow.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1304s)

But he had chickens. Yeah. Chicken pens, remember the chickens? Yeah, he had a massive chicken shed and they used to sell eggs. They were engineers, diesel boat engines. They used to work on boat engines and I used to go down and stay with them. Ken had bunk beds [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1335s) his room and I used to stay there with him. We used to love it. All the way, most of the school holidays down there. We had some right laughs.

And then when he moved up, he was kind of getting a bit more serious into it by then, and I was getting to the stage where I'd had enough. And because I could drive by then, we were [clearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1365s) off. We had a pub walking distance from our house, just up the hill. I could actually be rolled down the hill home, it was that close. But they knew we used to go there.

It was called the William Cookworthy, was the name of the pub. Anyway, we used to go there and I borrowed one of my mates from school's girlfriend. I borrowed his cigarette. I had my own pint. And we walked out of the pub laughing and joking. I had my arm around this girl, and she was quite a looker. And we pretended, because they were sat there on the road in the car, waiting and watching.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1432s)

Oh yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1433s)

And we knew they were there. We saw them because he had this old Peugeot 504 estate.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1439s)

Yeah, remember them. Oh, they all had those. They were the only car you could fit a Brethren family in, weren't they? Because they had so many kids.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1449s)

They got VW campers now, haven't they?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1451s)

Yep, they have.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1452s)

Transit minibus. Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1458s)

Well, that's what they came and picked us up with when we went down in 2003\. A minibus. Yeah. When they confiscated our mobile phones on the night that we stayed in their house. Yeah, they were trying to get her back. They didn't want me.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1481s)

Fucking mad idiot.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1483s)

Don't have me. Yeah, in 2003, when my marriage broke up, I actually phoned my mum and told her my marriage broke up. And I got beat up by a neighbour. Won't go into the details of that. But a couple of days later, they came and picked us up to go and stay with them for a week. At the time, I didn't think nothing of it. I thought they were just being helpful and taking me away from the situation. But the first night, they confiscated our phones.

Second night, I managed to get my phone in so that I could text people. And on the morning that we were getting ready to go back, I don't remember who the leader was then, because I know it wasn't Caleb anymore, it was somebody else.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1545s)

Well after him.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1546s)

Yeah, he came to see me and he turned around and said to me, "If you come back to us, we'll give you a house with the top of the range furnishings." It was what I learned a few weeks ago, me and my daughter were talking, and she said her and her younger sister were told that if I accepted their offer, they wouldn't want for anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1584s)

But that, 2003, that is when all that was happening. It was just like a little blip. They suddenly decided, Bruce Hales, the universal leader, he had just come in, his father had passed away. And he had this idea that he was going to get a whole lot of people who had been withdrawn from, he was going to get them back. And so everyone was told to, you know, if you know people, got relatives who are out of [fellowship,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1614s) contact them and see if you can tempt them to come back in, money no object. And of course, it didn't actually work. I mean, yeah, there were one or two who came back, but nearly everyone said, "Yeah, no, it's lovely to meet you and see you and find out how you're getting on, but no way am I going back into that mess."

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1634s)

Well, I turned around and said, "You brainwashed me once in my life, you ain't doing it again. Get me to the station, quick."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1640s)

Good for you.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1641s)

But the thing is, we were the first in our street to have cable TV. Yeah, my kids were the first to have a computer in the house. Okay, my marriage had gone to pot. I've got four kids. Do you really think I was going to take all that away from my kids?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1666s)

When they've got TV.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1667s)

I couldn't do it. You know, they've got mobile phones and everything. The eldest was just gone into secondary school, and that's when I first allowed her to have her first mobile phone. I couldn't do that to my kids. I couldn't take all that away from my kids.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1685s)

No, absolutely. Even with top of the range appliances, I mean, come on, who cares?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1693s)

You know, no TV, we were bored out of our brains. The youngest at the time was four.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1711s)

Oh, wow.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1714s)

Because the eldest was 12\. Then there was 10\. April was six, seven. Nathan was four. I couldn't do it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1736s)

No, no, very wise. Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1741s)

And I thought, just get me home. They had to emergency post a load of stuff in the parcel post, first class, because the one daughter left her blanket behind. She cried the whole way on the train.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1757s)

Oh, that's a long way.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1760s)

Wow. So we got off the train in Birmingham and I went to TJ Hughes to buy her this cellular blanket, another mint green cellular blanket. Wow. Otherwise, I wouldn't have got her to bed that night.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1782s)

So you didn't sign up for the whole fancy house and appliances and all that then? That was a no.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1788s)

That was a definite no. They didn't even get in touch with me. I didn't hear nothing about it. Ruth told me this ages after.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1799s)

Yeah. Was that because you borrowed that guy's girlfriend and walked down the street with her? Probably.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1808s)

Yeah. But then the lads would have told them what we were doing with the waves down at Porthmellon. I think they would have realised that we were rebels. Oh come on, we had three lads in the back with me in the front and you in the back, and we were playing chicken with the waves at Porthmellon. Oops, I hope your sons don't get to watch this, John. I promise they'd never hear of that.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1837s)

They'll probably watch it. Yeah, we used to play chicken when the big waves were coming across. We would race the car through the... when the huge waves were crashing over because the road goes right round across the top of the beach. You can stand on the beach and put your hand on the top of the road.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1869s)

Yeah.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1870s)

And the waves used to come right up over and hit the houses.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1874s)

The houses had to be barred up in the winter. And we used to play chicken. Looking back now, if a wave caught us, we wouldn't have been here. We wouldn't have stood a chance, no way.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1888s)

I actually, now I look at it and say, you silly... Yeah. Oh, hello. Hello, Jacky. How are you?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D1910s)

Hello. Sorry I'm late, everybody.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D1913s)

I'm the nutty one, by the way. You're very welcome, John. My wife and I, Rachel's totally blind, my wife, and we do a radio show here in Cornwall called Blind and Bonkers.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1924s)

So if your wife's the blind one, then you are...

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D1928s)

Yeah, you've got it. I've got it. I'm one month dry as well, on the old booze.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1943s)

Oh, well done. It's took a long... Well done. Yes. Good for you.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=1947s)

But the trouble is, I was drinking at senior school. We were all drinking. I was 12\. We were taking whiskey and you'd have it in your jacket pocket, because you could pinch it out of the kitchen cupboard. And we'd go to the senior school with booze in our pockets. And because I was bigger than all the rest of them, I could get into the pub up the road. And I also knew the bouncers on the door.

So we were getting served when we were still really young children. I was working as a bouncer on the door up there in the evening, getting paid in beer, and then going to school the following morning and then wondering why I'm falling asleep in the lessons. So, you know, no wonder that I've had such a problem with drink all my life.

And my boys, most of my boys love a drop or two. I went out with one of my sons at Christmas, and we were sat in a pub having food and suddenly the door slams open in this little village pub and three cops come in, two blokes and a lady. They go running past and I'm thinking, "Oh my God, what was that now? What have we done?" But they ran past us and they were arresting these three sat on the table next to us. The trouble is, we had the van out in the car park, and the police car was parked by our van.

And we'd been on the sauce for quite a while. Yeah, and it was too far to walk home. So my son says, "Come on, father," he said, "we better get out of here." So we had a word with the barman and he let us out the back door so they didn't actually see us walk out the main door of the pub. He said, "Right, get in quick." I put my leg up, and because I was so... I fell over backwards, [landed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2108s) with my backside in a puddle.

The conservatory bit on the pub where the police were with these three under arrest was 20 foot from the van, and there was me sat in a blue puddle with my legs in the air. And Tristan said, "Father," he said, "if you lose my license for me, I'm gonna fucking kill you." Got in quick. Oh my goodness.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D2130s)

So whereabouts in Cornwall are you, John?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D2133s)

We're in St Austell. We're in Roche, they call it the clay country. We're halfway between St Austell and Newquay.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2169s)

I left the same village in '94. Yeah, she did a moonlight flit. Yeah, we did. We got a house in Wolverhampton at the time. We didn't hand our notice in until the day we posted our notice on the way up to Birmingham.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2195s)

Right. So I went round a couple days later and you were gone.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2202s)

Yeah. I'd had a really difficult time at that moment because I'd had a really difficult time with having my second daughter. We had a lot of problems towards the end of the pregnancy. I was threatened with preeclampsia and the cord was wrapped around her neck quite bad and I lost contractions, so she was actually born blue.

She was in neonatal for 12 days, and I went through this hatred of my mother not being a mother that I needed. Yeah, that she was being controlled and she didn't have the guts to stand up and support her daughter.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2251s)

So how long had you been out of the Brethren at that point?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2255s)

At that point, how old was I? I was 25, so I'd been out eight, nine years. Yeah, because I left at 17\.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2275s)

If you were able to walk back there and walk into a meeting room, what's one thing you would say to them?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2289s)

One thing I'd say to them, how cruel they are.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2292s)

Yeah.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2294s)

How loveless.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2296s)

Yeah, and what a bunch of lying beeps they are. Yeah, that as well. We've been watching, because I suppose I've not really told my wife, even though we've been married 20-odd years, I'm on my second marriage. I haven't told her a great deal about it because I've had it buried in a box. And I stuck a great big pile of heavy stones on it. Don't want to go there.

But I've been told, since I've joined this group with trying to stop the drinking, "Well, have you sorted it out? Have you put it to bed properly?" And what do you mean? "Have you got any help for it? Have you seen anyone?" Did a bit of counselling, but the counsellor, they kept... [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2357s) was lovely. I'd go and see these counsellors and they'd tell you to go and see them at your meeting. And I'd go for one meeting and then they'd say, "Oh, see you next week." And then I'd have a phone call through the week and say, "Oh, sorry, your meeting's been changed." And then I'll get to a new person and they say, "Oh, sorry, they moved me on to you because you were too bad for the previous one."

And it just kept on happening. And then in the end, I thought, "Sod this," and that's been my case now. Just sort of stick around, I'll have a drink, I don't give a shit. And that was my way of... that was before food was a crutch. But then I ended up at 25 stone, had stomach surgery, had a gastric bypass, lost 11 stone. So, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2412s) all good and proper now. And then COVID came.

That sort of, and my youngest, my third son has moved himself and my only granddaughter to live in, oh, up near London anyway, a long way from here. It's got loads and loads of roundabouts. Milton Keynes, around that area.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2445s)

It's either Milton Keynes or... one or the other. Yeah. Roundabouts.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2454s)

Oh, the bad B, Basingstoke. Basingstoke, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2459s)

Okay, a bit further south, yeah. No, I don't know. I've never been.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2462s)

I've been on that one. I used to drive a truck years and years and years ago.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2468s)

Well, yeah, because you moved us from Bilston to Birmingham. When we moved from Bilston to Birmingham.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2478s)

I drove an artic truck on a car license. Wow. From Cornwall to Birmingham. Yeah. Picked up this guy because this guy, he rented the truck, paid it all because he'd moved down here on his own, got a job, but he didn't want to move his wife and kids down till he was kind of set up. And he was playing football the day before, broke his leg.

But he paid the deposit on this and that and the other. Anyway, paid me some minimal amount of money. "Have you driven a truck?" I said, "No, I only passed my car license three weeks ago." And he said, "Do you fancy driving an artic truck?" I said, "Yeah, I'll give it a go." So I ended up driving from Cornwall to Birmingham and back.

And the van, right, you'll love this. The van had "COONS", C-O-O-N-S, written down the side of the van. And I'd only just come out from the Brethren, and I obviously didn't know what the slang word for a coloured person was. I had no idea. And I was wondering why all these colored people were lobbing bricks at the lorry. Yeah. It was a van, it's an Arsenal company. Yeah. And the van was called, it was great, big huge letters down the side of this truck. Oh my God. Yeah, that was a few years ago.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2599s)

Joining the conversation a little late, how old were you when you left? You may have covered this earlier, but I was a little late joining. How old were you when you left the Brethren, John?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2608s)

I was 20\. I was, because I'm four years older than Ruth.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2616s)

I actually left two weeks before John. I moved out of my mother's house two weeks before John.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2621s)

Yeah, you had a place to stay. I ended up sleeping in cars and all sorts over the years. You know, there was no help. It was just, it was kind of like jumping off a precipice in the fog. And you knew there was something down there underneath. It may be water, it might be rocks, it might be spikes. You know, you're lucky if it's a mattress. Yeah, you've got to jump and tough luck, you've got to go. You were kicked out and off you went.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2659s)

Well, I was 17 and I had to explain to the social why I was claiming money for myself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2670s)

How did the social react, Ruth? Because you know, at 17, how did they react to the fact that presumably your parents weren't helping in any shape or form?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2682s)

They were quite shocked, but I didn't have any trouble. They did sort out my money and paid my rent.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2690s)

Thankfully, yeah. So they helped you, but it's sort of quite surprising, I imagine, for them that you were left high and dry.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2699s)

You don't understand. I think you don't understand how life works, nothing. You know, you've got a TV and something to watch, but you don't really understand what's going on.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2714s)

We'd had a TV for quite a while, a little tiny black and white portable since...

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2723s)

Live Aid. We got the black and white one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2727s)

'85, wasn't it? So since then. Oh.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2736s)

I got in major trouble because I had a really bad car accident up in Poole in Dorset. One of the guys was called Pete Woodfield and one of them was called Peter Steedman, I think. And one of them, his dad was a rally driver or something. And he had this Saab that was like a road-going rally car, beautiful thing. Anyway, I was drinking this export lager, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2767s) was only 16\.

And they were giving me this real strong lager, and I was necking this in the back of the car. No seatbelt. They were all with the full race harness on in the front, but I wanted to have a ride in this rally car. So he said, "Alright, I'll take you on a stage." Anyway, so he goes and ends up coming off the road and rolling down through these trees, totally mullered the car. And I ended up in Poole hospital, on death's door. And I watched Charles and Di's marriage on the telly the day before.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2811s)

I got my mother to stand outside Granada TV rentals in the town.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2818s)

Yes, I remember that.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2821s)

Whether she confessed that, I don't know, but I didn't.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2824s)

So you were both in the Brethren at that time? Oh wow. Yeah, I remember that. I remember the royal wedding. It was a Saturday, wasn't it? And we all went strawberry picking in Norfolk. Our family went strawberry picking, which we did every year. At the little kind of Portakabin where you paid for your strawberries after you picked them, they had a little portable up in the back. And I was, what year was that, '81? So I was like 12, I don't know.

And I just got a glimpse of this TV, and I think it was probably just showing the ceiling of Westminster Abbey or something. It was just panning up the ceiling, they didn't actually show any wedding as such, but it was playing. Anyway, of course, then we all had this confession session, and me as a 12-year-old, I remember confessing to having watched the royal wedding. It was like the first time I'd ever spoken in public. It was absolutely terrifying.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2887s)

Yeah, I can remember too that we went out, my mother and I went out for a walk on the day and we found a house that conveniently didn't have net curtains. And I stood on the pavement for about half an hour and watched it. And exactly, my memory is the same as yours, Richard. It was then a how, how wicked and awful it was that Brethren had found ways to watch the royal wedding. And there was a mass confession [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2918s) was coming up. And I remember asking mum, I was 16 at the time, asking mum, "Do you think I should confess?" And my mother said, "Oh, don't be so ridiculous." And I think that's probably why I'm where, and my mother is where we are today. Good for your mum. Yeah, we left sort of two or three years after that. Yes, I remember being quite shocked by her saying that, but not in a bad way. Oh yeah, because it was a bit farcical, wasn't it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2957s)

No, absolutely, it was. I mean, some localities, I think a lot of people were actually shut up for a couple of weeks.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2965s)

Yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2966s)

And in some places, there wasn't anyone left to kind of conduct it, so they had to sort of wait for one set of priests to be released so they could then go and serve the rest of the sinners.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=2977s)

I remember just afterwards, I think it was just afterwards, my sister had an operation. And I don't know whether it was before or after, but I know there were times when I was up country. Oh, it was another time when all the families had to confess that they'd done something wrong at the beginning of their marriage or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3005s)

Oh yes, 1986\.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3009s)

Because I was staying at my auntie's and uncle's and they had to have separate bedrooms and whatever. And I was farmed off to another uncle. So I'm guessing that my one uncle had to pay my other uncle the money that they didn't have for having me, I'm supposing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3025s)

So who were your uncles? What were their names?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DAFNK0qwRlZw%26t%3D3029s)

The Barltrops in...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3033s)

Oh, the Barltrops\! We know the Barltrops. The Barltrops are very interesting people.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3036s)

Dave and Esther. I loved Dave and Esther.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3039s)

Oh, they're very sweet. Yeah, I knew them very well.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3044s)

My Uncle Dave was the only uncle that I could sit on his lap and feel as if I was wanted. Yeah. And Rhoda and I used to write like a journal every night to each other. And out of my family, I think they were the only ones that I've ever really, really missed. And it's a sort of, I'd love to know what's happened to them, what they're doing and who's alive and who's not.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3081s)

Well, yeah. Are you and John the only two in your immediate family not in the Brethren now?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3087s)

Yeah, yeah. All the rest are dead.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3091s)

Yeah, all our family, yeah. We're the only two ones alive. I suppose there's cousins and whatever still alive.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3099s)

I think Uncle Ken's still going, because Uncle Ken moved down to live with mum in St Austell when Granddad Barltrop married one of the women from Plymouth.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3113s)

Phoebe.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3115s)

Phoebe, yeah, that's right.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3120s)

And all I kept saying to him was, "Why couldn't you have married Olive? She's much nicer than Phoebe."

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3125s)

That's right. She was one of them that was sucking on a thistle that the dogs had wee’d on.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3133s)

I actually told him that. Because Phoebe was toffee-nosed and really pushed us off. We weren't allowed to call her grandmother or nothing. We had to call her Aunt Phoebe.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3144s)

Yeah, because Kenny Barltrop was quite a famous character in the Brethren. He was a bachelor, wasn't he? And he used to travel around a lot. We used to call him Boy George or something.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3157s)

Right, yeah, quite possibly. Some sort of...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3161s)

Quite good on the piano. Yeah, he's famous. Yeah, Uncle Kenny, wow.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3169s)

Kenny Barltrop, famous? Wow. He crashed a car in Truro, Truro roundabout, coming back from St Austell one night in his little Mini. There were three of us in the back: Rhoda, Jimmy, and me.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3189s)

Yeah, and I was in the front with Uncle Ken.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3191s)

Yeah, in a Mini.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3195s)

In a Mini, it was cream coloured. You'd be surprised how many people you can get in a Mini.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3204s)

And it's surprising how well they roll and go back on their wheels and drive home.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3212s)

We'd done the Boxing Day swim in the sea down at a place called Carlyon Bay. And as we got out of the water at 10 in the morning, the landlord, Cyril Dingle he was called, he's a really nice chap, passed us a bottle of whiskey. And then we went back to his pub to warm up, and we were on snakebites and whiskey chasers all day.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3251s)

At the time, Par Inn did the best Cornish pasties in the area.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3255s)

They certainly did. Anyway, one of my friends just bought an Escort Mexico, rather nice. But we had this black Mini, it was hand-painted. Do you remember JPS, John Player Special? Yeah, he had hand-painted this thing and we bought it off him. He was a bit of a mechanic and he played around with the engine and it did go rather well.

So yeah, he was boasting how fast his car was. I said, "Yeah, right, bet my Mini's faster than that." So anyway, we ended up racing on the way home when we'd been drinking [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3307s) day. And we went around this corner and I overtook him. Mucking about, swerved the wheel in to cut him up, and it was icy. And we lost it.

I was racing bangers at the time, doing banger racing, so I knew a bit how to drive, but I was so drunk, I was overcompensating. I was going from lock to lock to lock. And it was making it worse and worse. We ended up rolling off the road, over a verge, and into a field.

Anyway, our mate stops and comes over. I'm downwards and you're lying on top of me, I think. I can't remember, but I remember being pulled out through the window. Yeah, they pulled us out through the window. We rolled it back on the wheels and we drove it home.

Oh no, it wouldn't start because the battery was in the boot in those days and the battery had come unhooked, and the exhaust pipe had fallen off. So I picked it up and lobbed it in the boot, and it sounded worse than a tractor going home. And this is like midnight. I got into trouble about that. Anyway, the following day, I had to pinch a can of one of mum's tins of beans or something from the cupboard because I needed a bit of metal. And I managed to mend the exhaust with two jubilee clips and a piece of metal, and Bob's your uncle. And I sold that car for more money than we paid for it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3440s)

For our listeners that are not from the UK, the boot is the trunk.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3449s)

Interpretation needed, of course. Didn't think about that. John, you mentioned earlier about you haven't had a drink for a month, but then you were talking about the culture that you were brought up under. So that would be what, back in the '80s? When you were in the Brethren, was drink still a big thing at that stage? Because we know it is now.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3481s)

Yeah, yeah, big style. Oh, you'll love this. Because I was naughty and all that, I used to go down to this little wine shop, and I was using it before I was old enough. So I was quite friendly with the owner. And I would go down there every now and again and say to him, "Have you got anything different? I fancy trying something different." He said, "Well, I've got this." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3512s) he goes out the back and he brings this little bottle, about this big, of Polish pure spirit. 140% proof.

Wow. Clear as water. You could put one teaspoon into someone's coffee or tea and they wouldn't feel it until they went outside. And I was quite friendly with one of the guys who used to book the preachers. So I would find out through, you know, means...

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3571s)

If we were hosting one of the preachers.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3575s)

Yeah. So his drink... "Oh no, I don't drink the wicked stuff. I'll have a cup of tea." So I'd give him a cup of tea with a spoonful of this in there. All the stuff they came out with, man, brilliant. If only there'd been a way of recording stuff back then. It would have been like that clinking with the old JTJr, with the glass. We listened to it the other night, mate. He was going on about it, you could hear the ice clinking in the glass.

But the trouble is, we used to go to Bristol, and all we did there was just get hammered on the back row. We always sat as far back as we could, and we'd be passing our mixtures of booze along the back row.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3645s)

That was for the fellowship meeting, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3651s)

Once a month they used to hold it.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3657s)

Yeah, but the trouble is, you had to be good for X amount of days before to be allowed to go, to get your invite.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3670s)

I mean, we're laughing, but if you try and describe that scene to somebody who didn't know the Brethren. So there's a group of Christians who are meeting in a church, however many hundred of them, once a month. I only ever went once.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3695s)

Oh, you were a better person than me, Ruth. We came from a small lot, so we circulated.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3706s)

We used to have a seven-seater Peugeot. We used to go up from St Austell every time. So as long as you behaved yourself, you'd be on it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3722s)

But as I'm trying to paint the scene of 2,000 people, and then you've got yourselves and your friends who are getting basically paralytic on the back row of a church, which is essentially what was happening there, wasn't it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3744s)

It was normal.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3746s)

That's a better way to describe it, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3748s)

If you weren't drinking in the meeting hall, you sure were drinking before you got there or afterwards. I mean, if you breathalysed everyone in that room, 99% of them would be over the limit.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3760s)

Oh yeah. There was a big whoo-ha because one of them, he was a real nice chap, a guy called Shimwell from Plymouth. He used to always drive Alfas. But he had quite a bad car accident on the motorway, I think, on the way back from somewhere. And the police breathalysed him and he was way over the limit. Way over. But oh, we were nuts, weren't we?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3806s)

Yeah. Funny, but nuts. You wonder too how much of it stems from, with the drinking, because it's obviously an insular, inward environment. I can remember going to a pub and the first time being given a pub measure and thinking, "Is that all?" Not realizing that people understood what a measure of alcohol was because pubs restricted [it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3836s) But because the Brethren were never in that environment, you know, they just poured away, didn't they?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3847s)

Well, you said, "Don't worry about that, give us a bottle."

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3853s)

It's like, as a teenager, because of being locked in the house while Rachel had her last brain operation, she was in Plymouth. John was at work, and the father used to lock me in the house because he was deaf. "Well, what if somebody came?" He used to lock me in. I tried getting out one afternoon and he whipped me with his walking stick right across my back. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3884s) had this lovely big red mark right the way down my back because I tried leaving the house one afternoon. So John didn't know where the whiskey was hidden. I did.

So every afternoon, my old man, the father, used to go up to bed for his afternoon nap. I'd be sitting drinking a glass of whiskey. And I would have been 14, 15 at that point.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3916s)

Yeah, I would have been younger than that. I can remember I was given my first drink of scotch at the age of 12\. Which, yeah, I mean, there were quite sort of extenuating circumstances, but still not quite the answer. I actually had a baby sister that died, and I was 12 years old. It was the night before her burial. She'd lived for nine days, and I was obviously a little distressed, you know, as a 12-year-old would be. And I was with relatives in the Brethren at the time, and their answer to my distress was to give me a glass of scotch. Which, I mean, it's sort of funny, but it isn't funny.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3961s)

We were always given drinks in the Brethren. You know, at 13, 14, I was given, you know, that's what you wanted. "I'll have a martini."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3978s)

I had one a couple of years ago and I thought, "How the heck did I like this?" It's horrible. It's an awful drink. But maybe that's association, Ruth, because I used to ask for martini too. So maybe it's association.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=3994s)

It must be. Give me a decent bourbon. That's it. We drink bourbons here now, maybe more up your street.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4009s)

I suppose the thought process is that when you've got that culture, it would be very hard not to become addicted to alcohol, wouldn't it? For a lot of people.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4023s)

When my marriage broke up, I literally hit depression. I used to take the kids to school, and on the way home, I used to stop in the shop and buy me a pack of four Archers and have four Archers a night.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4045s)

It's a coping mechanism, isn't it? But it can be quite a destructive one.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4055s)

But luckily, when we moved from Wolverhampton to Bilston, I stopped drinking then. I stopped the nightly drinking. But you've been surrounded by adults, you've got somebody to talk to, then all of a sudden you're on your own with four kids and they've all gone to bed. What do you do? Loneliness kicks in. So what did I do? I sat on chat rooms. Met another fella, he moved in, had another child, and then got married to him and then divorced him.

But I've married all the wrong people, been with all the wrong people, because we don't know how... we've got no people skills at the time. You're not taught how to react to people, you're not taught how to respond to people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4123s)

No, or to respond when things go wrong either. I don't think there's any, I suppose you could call it, teaching of emotional intelligence amongst the Brethren. In as much as if something goes wrong with you, "Well, that's because you're wrong," is the answer, isn't it? And there's no sort of, "Well, let's, you know, things happen, let's try and help you have some coping strategies, let's support you." There's none of [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4153s) It's, "You're wrong, and if you get right, it'll be fine." That's the sort of underlying ethos, isn't it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4158s)

They have no idea. I mean, in the Brethren, the word "compromise" is an evil word, it's a bad word. They have no idea about agreeing to differ. You can't say that in the Brethren. Everything is black and white. You're either right or you're wrong. And it makes us hard to get on with unless we get over that mentality.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4183s)

But I realised how cold my mother was. I was expecting my second when Rachel died, our disabled sister. I had to make the appointment to go and visit her body. I remember walking into my mother's house and I remember this chill wash over me. And the old man, the father, coming and preaching and going on and on and on at me, and I'm thinking, "Can't you just shut the old fart up?"

And I saw my sister, but I couldn't feel anything. I just felt so cold. But when I got home, I phoned a friend, somebody I knew that had actually been helping my mother with looking after my [sister,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4239s) and I said to her, "What's the feeling when you walk into my house?" And she said, "You explain first and I'll explain to you." So I told her how I felt.

And she just turned around and said to me down the phone, "You grew up in that cold atmosphere." And then when I saw my mother in 2001, when we had our first holiday down in Cornwall after we moved, I went to see her and she gave me a hug, but it was like hugging a plank of wood. She was so cold and stiff. And I swore that my house would never be like that. And I swore nobody would ever feel cold and unwelcome in my home. Listening to other people, they're so cold and unfeeling.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4300s)

I knew that Rachel, our sister, didn't have long. And so I said to them, "I want to say goodbye to her," because obviously she is my baby sister and I loved her. And they said, "Oh yeah, we'll let you know." They phoned me. So I rushed around in the car, got there. Caleb was there, Jim was there. Father and mother walk into Rachel's bedroom, and she's dead and freezing cold.

So I went out and I was more than a bit miffed. I don't think I was drunk then, probably not. "What the hell's going on? Why have you not let me know before? I asked to be let know," I said, "I gave you my number." Because I had a mobile. "Oh no, we waited until she was cold, till her spirit had left her body so that you could not interfere with her going up to God." And I've never forgiven Caleb (Caleb Furse) for that, because he was the one that engineered that. And if I could find where his grave is, I would go and piddle on it. And I am not joking.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4396s)

They still do that. My grandfather, my father passed three or four months ago, and my uncle who was withdrawn from and I, we weren't told until after he was buried.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4418s)

Well, they did that with mother. Yeah. Because somebody had provided me with a lift to go to a funeral.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4430s)

Yeah, that's right. Steve Furse or someone, I think it was Steve, got in touch with me and said, "Mum's been taken poorly." So I raced down to the local hospital and met Steve on the ward and he took me in there and I managed to speak to her. They were sort of hovering on my shoulder, but I could see she was not good. And I sort of leaned over and whispered in her ear, "I'm sorry for the shit I've put you through, Mum."

And that's the last thing I ever said to her because we went down the following day, Rachel and myself. We went down to see her and Esther was down there, Esther Glazebrook, Ken's wife. And they were not happy that I'd gone down there without the, you know, the mission [chaperones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4511s) and all the BS. But the second time I went, mum was sort of gone that bit too far. She kind of smiled at me when I apologised, she wasn't able to say anything, but I saw her mouth moving, a bit of a smile, so I'm pretty sure I got through.

Anyway, I said to Steve, because then he rang me and said, "Oh, mum's passed." I said, "Okay, thanks for letting me know. Can you let me know when she's being buried? I'd like to come." "Alright, no problem," he said, "I'll give you a shout." So we had to come up to Evesham to Rachel's parents because we had a birthday party or something. We had to do a birthday party for Rachel's niece because Rachel sings and we do discos.

So we'd gone up and done this [birthday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4601s) party and we were staying at this motel on the side of the motorway, and I got a message from Steve: "Oh, we buried mum this morning. It was just like God was smiling on us or something like this." And so I rang him, "What the hell do you mean? I said, you promised you would let me know so that I could be there." "Oh, they didn't think it was wise."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4645s)

Who are they?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4648s)

The rest of the heavies.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4652s)

So how long ago would this have been that your mother passed?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4658s)

2017. Not that long ago. No. She'd always looked after other people.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4671s)

She had an elderly woman go to live with her after father died. But father died in '96. I didn't know till 2001 that he'd gone.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4685s)

Yeah. I can't remember who told me. Somebody told me. Well, I said, "What a bummer." I said I would have been paying for a street party and had a party the day that he passed. All he did, he would make us go and fetch the bamboo cane to whip our backsides. Pull your trousers down and your underwear down, and Ruth had her skirt up and pull down her knickers, and he would be whipping us with this cane across our bare backsides. And they wouldn't say nothing about it. And I showed them one time, I dropped my drawers and showed them, and they said, "Oh no, you've done that to yourself just to make people feel sorry for you."

Yeah, that's shocking. We were still in school then, we were still school kids, but we were going to the proper, normal schools, not one of their schools. Because they have to travel an hour from St Austell to Plymouth to go to the one down here now. The wives have to drive them in a [minibus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4771s) from St Austell to Plymouth and then back home, an hour at the end of the day. I think it's cruel what they put the kids through.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4783s)

They shouldn't have such a long day.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4785s)

There's probably a home in St Austell, and one of the teachers who used to teach us at the main school, Poltair School, yeah. He was a metalwork teacher. Yeah, but they had him working for them. Right. Because when I worked for Steve, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4815s) was to deliver some... because they made a full-on football pitch for the kids to play football on, a proper full-size pitch. And it was pretty good and all, and they levelled the land out for it. And they gave all that up. I don't know why. This guy must have been... because Charlie [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4846s) quite old when we were there, wasn't he? So maybe because he used to live up top of the hill, by the radio telescope.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4879s)

Oh, Goonhilly Downs and all that, yeah, that kind of thing.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4882s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4883s)

So did the Brethren ever apologize to you for the way you were treated, the way you were thrown out and left?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4892s)

Never, ever. When they came looking for Ruth and asked her about coming back, they never offered that to me. I wouldn't have anyway, but you know, I would like to say I'd had six kids by then, and my ex-wife now, she's had nine, but you know. Well, no, I don't know, we found out what was causing it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4924s)

What, the kids?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4926s)

Yeah, there wasn't enough stuff on the telly. Oh yeah. My ex-wife said, "You either go and get it sorted or you ain't getting no more bedroom." So I go and see the local GP and he says, "Oh yeah, no problem." He said, "I know you've got five kids." I said, "Well yeah, we've got plenty. You've got four boys and a girl." And so he said, "Yeah, okay, I'll get hold of the local hospital and arrange it." And before [I...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=4983s) yeah, then we had Damo, wasn't it? That's right. While I was waiting to have it done, she got pregnant with Damo.

And then after I had it done, yes, she had a market baby, then a cappuccino one. People wanted a discount at the local open-air market. So the Indian stallholder said to her, "Okay missus, if you want some discount, up in the back of the van and I'll give you some discount." And he'd give her a blooming... give her green shield stamps as well, you know. Yeah, and so my sixth is not mine at all. Then like I say, she's had nine now, the ex.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5046s)

Have you got a Peugeot van to put them in, John? Sorry, that's... Peugeot vans just ring for my team here. Peugeot 505s, weren't they?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5059s)

My eldest still lives with us. Rachel and I have... I'd already had the snip before I met Rachel. And yeah, my eldest has lived with us all the time, but all the rest of them have all moved on. Kayleigh's got her own house, Tristan's got his own house, Nigel's up in Basingstoke with my one granddaughter. You'd think with that many kids I'd have hundreds of grandkids, wouldn't you?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5092s)

I've got one less kid than you and I've got five grandkids.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5099s)

But it's interesting, isn't it? So they obviously sought you out at that point, Ruth, in the 'review' time, but not John. You wonder why they'd be selective.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5111s)

I think they caught me at a very vulnerable time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5114s)

Oh, right. And they knew it?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5118s)

Yeah. You know, my marriage had gone up. Life had hit the papers. I'd got beat up by a neighbour. The ex was going to prison. I'd hit rock bottom.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5142s)

And they tried to be annoying. And I didn't know nothing about it. Because my ex had thrown her first husband out of our house because she found out about what he'd done. And my ex had said, "Get out of my house or I'm gonna throw you out. Don't you ever darken my door again."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5171s)

So do you think at the time they preyed on that vulnerability, Ruth?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5183s)

Yeah, because they knew I'd hit rock bottom. And the first thing they did was they came and almost rescued me, as if it was a rescue mission. "Yeah, we'll look after you." And then once I said no, that was it. They didn't want to know anymore. Sort of, get on with your life. You know, I'm suddenly on my own with four kids and nobody wants to know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5214s)

Yeah, it's, you know, the talk of care and compassion... you're laughing. It's conditional care and compassion, isn't it? Which it shouldn't be. If you, in your case, if you came back or whatever it was they wanted, "We will probably house you and help pay for your needs and everything else." But it's control, isn't it? It's about control.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5243s)

It's all about control. It's not real. When I heard, because I've lost a daughter to suicide, so when I heard that Hales had said, "We'd rather you commit suicide within the Brethren than leave," that was like somebody throwing a knife in my heart. I think I called him everything under the sun. Because my daughter committed suicide, she was 22\. I'd do anything to turn around and pull that back.

Because of that, and because I went through such a bad marriage, I've lost my granddaughter as well to adoption. So, you know, two years running, I lost two members of my family. And to hear anyone just talk of suicide like that...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5310s)

In an almost flippant way, and compare that to being better than talking to relatives outside the Brethren, which I think it was compared to, wasn't it? When you put it into the context of somebody that's experienced what you've experienced, Ruth, it's a travesty really, isn't it?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5327s)

Yeah. You'll like this one then. We were up visiting Rachel's parents and then they said mum was coming to see you. So we traveled up the extra 40 miles to see Ruth. Anyway, whoever the Brethren who ever brought mum round, somebody from Stafford, I think. Anyway, so they banged on the door and one of your kids let them in. And mother walked past Ruth, she walked past me, and she cuddled my wife.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5387s)

Wow. Presumably, she was nothing to do with the Brethren?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5393s)

No, nothing to do with the Brethren. Rachel had never even heard of them until she got with me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5400s)

What message does that give? That it's safer to cuddle an outsider than somebody that was inside and has left? Her own flesh and blood.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5411s)

Her own children. Her firstborn and second born. Because she did live just down the road. The radio station that we were volunteering at, we had to drive past mother's bungalow to get home. And so we called in one time, and she did see all my kids once because Ken and, I [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5451s) remember if it was Ken and Steve were there.

And I brought all my kids to see mum. So mum had seen all of my children once, I think, because she gave them all a Bible, one of their old zippy Bibles. And she gave one to Rachel as well, I think. Because Rachel used to go to church with her gran, so she was sort of religious a bit when she was a teenager. But oh yeah, no, don't hear none of it at all.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5500s)

It's like, John's been up to... I had my youngest christened because it was what his dad's family wanted. And John was in a right mess. And then my second daughter's eldest was christened and dedicated, and he came up to that one. But John's a mess if you put him in a church [situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5530s) Now, I'm the opposite.

But I nearly died in 2000\. I had an underactive thyroid that was undiagnosed and I literally had body shutdown. I literally asked God, I said, "You either give me the strength to get out of this bed and look after my four kids, or you end it now." I'll give you this ultimatum. But I got better. So yes, I have gone back to church.

I have arguments over some of the rituals, some of the conditions. Even though some of them know, you know, the church I'm with now is, "Oh, you've got to marry within the group." And I turned around and said, "That's control, I don't want to know." But they believe the Bible, they go by the Bible and they preach from the Bible, where they don't do rituals and things like the Church of England.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5623s)

But I think what's quite important is that people are completely entitled to believe what they like and to go to what church they want. But once it starts to control somebody's life when they don't want it controlled, as you say, it's a step too far. And once it starts to cause harm... I mean, I was thinking about this the other day. In a [sense,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5653s) the Brethren as a group can make up all the silly rules they like, it doesn't really matter. It's a free country. But where does it stop if those rules cause severe harm to people?

You know, they have a right to say, "We want to live in a detached house because we want to be separate," and you can laugh at that because it's sort of silly in the eyes of most people. But when it comes to families, where does that stop? At what point do you say, this freedom that we have in our countries, in the United States as well, in Canada and the UK, but the harm it's causing, something's got to be done because somebody has got control of it and is taking it down a [path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5696s) it shouldn't go.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5698s)

So that's kind of a perfect segue. I was going to say before we close, if you could offer one piece of advice, what would you tell them they needed to do to become a church again?

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5718s)

I was going to say pull the pin out of the grenade.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5725s)

Sorry. Yeah, but who's holding the grenade, John? That's what I want to know.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5735s)

I'll hold it and I'll throw it for them. They built a new joint now, a few years ago now, down in Cornwall. Two million quid they spent on it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5756s)

Wow. Is there anything you'd like to add, Ruth, before we go?

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5764s)

They need to put families back together. Yeah. A family should be together and not have hierarchy and lowerarchy. Everybody's born equal, everybody dies equal. There shouldn't be any rich or poor.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5783s)

Yeah, and they should treat their wives better as well. I don't believe in that where they've got to sit behind and all this BS. You know, God created us equal. And all this about not being allowed, and they don't like men marrying men and all that lot. Big deal, you know, God made that person. And oh, not allowed pets. Why not? God made animals. That really winds me up.

I've got loads of stupid questions I've asked loads of vicars. And then I say, "Well, if there's such a fantastic God as you're going on about, how come [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5842s) gone and given that poor little baby a brain tumour?" And they'll say, "Oh, God will provide." Yeah, right. I don't know. It ain't for me, I'm afraid. I wouldn't give them the flipping scrapings from my dirty nails.

And the amount of money they're giving out to all these... "Oh, we don't get involved in politics." Yeah, right. Instead of doing that, give it to charity. Give it to people who are hungry, rather than giving it to politicians who are minted anyway.

### [**Ruth Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5912s)

It should be kept in the community. Each community, you know, where I'm living, we're in a deprived community and I help run a food pantry. That's where the money should go, to help people that are really struggling. Not people that are sort of rolling in that much money they don't know what to do with it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5946s)

Yeah. Well, I think we've really enjoyed having you on today. Thank you very much, both of you.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5953s)

I've been looking forward to it like a giddy kid I am. Is it Christmas yet?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5963s)

Yeah, thank you very much, Ruth and John. It's absolutely fascinating. It's a real blast from the past.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5972s)

Yeah, my wife and I, we've been watching, we've been YouTubing. We spent the whole day yesterday watching.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5983s)

You binge-watched the podcast? Fantastic.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5990s)

And just Googled the hell out of it all.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=5997s)

Well, we appreciate that you're following us and making sure we keep on track.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6001s)

And I like that guy, the black bald one as well. I thought that was pretty cool as well. Oh, he's good.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6010s)

Yeah. James DiFiore. Yeah, I love it.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6014s)

And I understand him because he's a music guy as well. He is. Oh, he is. Yeah. I've got tattoos on my arm, "Music is my life," actually, tattooed on my arm. One of my tattoos, oh, you probably can't see, it's a bit dark. It's like an Elvis microphone, but on the bottom end of it, it's got a piston. The wire goes onto the crankshaft. All sorts of weird and wonderful art. Love it. We'll have to have a tat convention or something.

And this is a question for you, is there any radio, like ex-Brethren radio, that you know of? For outsiders, like a radio channel? I'd be interested in joining some of that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6086s)

Not that I know of on radio. I don't know if anyone else knows of any, but I don't know of one.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6096s)

No, I've just been thinking about it because we're... I don't really like the bloke, we got a new manager now at the one that we volunteer at, and I ain't very crash hot on him. He's a subway train driver from London and sort of...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6116s)

Well, maybe we'll hear of Blind and Bonkers on the radio.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6131s)

Yeah. The trouble is, I go and say stuff and I forget that I haven't turned the mics off. But the trouble is, when you're doing live radio, once you've said it, oops, too late. It's gone. And the amount of times I've said, "I've got to go for a pee," because I've got the old man's disease, you know, got to run for a wee. And the amount of times I've said, "Rachel, you'll have to take over, love. I'm absolutely breaking my neck," and she said, "I haven't pulled the faders [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6178s) on the mics."

Yeah, I got into trouble there a few times as well. "Mind your Ps and Qs on the radio." Yes, it's quite good because you could play whatever you wanted, within reason. As long as there was no swearing, you could play almost anything. So we played a lot of good music. A lot of banging tunes.

Anyway, like I say, thank you ever so much for having us. We enjoyed it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6213s)

Well, thank you so much.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6216s)

Thank you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6219s)

It's been fun. It's been a lot of fun.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6223s)

Good fun. If there's anyone that's needing help down this way, give them my name. I'd love to help someone who wanted to get away. I'd love to be able to help them so they could avoid some of the pitfalls that we ended up falling in. Just a bit of advice, you know. Because a lot of them, apparently, they can't see much because it's so ruled what they can and can't do. Okay, you can go to the library, but how do you know when you go to the library there ain't someone gonna see you [go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6279s)

It's a shame that they're getting away with it. It really is. They need the old... send Rachel after them. She's got a white stick with a ball on it, and that thing is laser-guided. She can have some fun with that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6309s)

That's a great note to end on, I think. It's a good image, isn't it? A fantastic image.

### [**John Beresford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6319s)

She says, "For goodness sake, hurry up, get me indoors. It's raining. I'm getting wet." I'm struggling to breathe at the minute. All good fun. Lovely job. Super.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNK0qwRlZw&t=6340s)

All right. Well, we'll set her down there. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
