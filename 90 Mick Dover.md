## Summary

Imagine scars of abuse that run so deep the story moves us all to tears.  As our special guest Mick Dover shares the story of his childhood stained with abuse from members of the very church he was brainwashed into believing must be accommodated and respected at all costs.  The families that make up the hierarchy of the PBCC in Melbourne, Australia- the Bakers, McAlpin, Cox,  Gadsden, Grace, Joyce, John, Jensen, Nipper, Hales, Dover and the list goes on had best sit up and listen as Mick explains the complete lack of safeguarding and cover-up of every kind of abuse imaginable. A 7 year old child thrown through a metal reinforced glass shower door because he walked in on his father & another spinster from the PBCC in bed together.  Late night priestly visits that turn into a big drinking  conversation, the story so bone-chilling and yet the members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church had the audacity to attempt to recruit Mick & Debbie to rejoin the church in what appears to be an attempt to further keep a lid on the abuse. How many more victims might there be of this horrendous childhood rape, sexual trauma, physical abuse, and religious coercive brainwashing?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=0s)

Hello, everyone.

Welcome back to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today, we've got a really special podcast for you.

Richard and I have brought on Ben and our very special guest, Mick Dover.

We've got a really wild story. But to tell you the truth, we really don't know what we're getting into here, Richard and I and Ben too, because we've never met before, Mick, have we? We've never spoken.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=37s)

No, we've never met. I don't know any of you. I know where you come from.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=42s)

Exactly. So that's why it's going to be a really interesting story, and we're excited to get into it. I think it's going to be dark. I think there's going to be some, you know, some dark stuff we're going to have to get into here. But we want to listen and and really hear what happened, what was your life like inside the Plymouth Brethren. And so just feel free to start wherever you want and tell us as much or as little as you want.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=70s)

Well, first of all, it's very emotional for me. I struggle with it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=81s)

I'm going to start with where you're from and yeah.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=86s)

Okay, I'm from Melbourne. I live in Boronia. I've lived with my wife for 40 years in Boronia.

I married somebody that was nothing to do with the brethren. I've been a recluse for most of my life.I'm hugely emotional because I know what's coming. I'm going to tell a story about my life.It affects me every day.

I've got to get a control of myself, I know that. But having said that, I want to, shall I say, tell my story from the beginning. I'm not sure how to start, but given that my life was difficult at the least, it was violent. The abuses are numerous in so many ways. Most things I've heard about have happened in my life.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=172s)

How old were you, do you think, when you can kind of remember something really bad, like the first bad thing that happened?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=182s)

Five years of age.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=189s)

So your family, obviously, were in?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=194s)

Yes, I lived in a family that was fairly affluent.

By most standards, I was in a family that, shall I say, were wealthy, needed them nothing, but we had a very cold, broken family.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=213s)

So your relationship with your parents was strained even at a young age?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=229s)

At a young age, I wasn't listened to. I was, and in the brethren's eyes, a naughty boy.

I was uncontrollable. There are many people that have spoken to me and said, "You're a bitter person." Well, I'm not bitter. I'm a very tortured person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=252s)

But also, I do want to say you have every right to be. If you've been treated a certain way, you have every right to feel that emotion, to feel bitter. You might not be bitter about life and about everything else, but you have every right to feel that bitterness.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=270s)

Well, I find that resentful, being accused of being bitter, because I've always shown kindness. I've never wanted another person. I may have, but it was never intentional. It's always been my to show good kindness, show a difference that I'm not the way I was treated. I will never entertain the thought that I could harm another, and that harm carried out in my life.

I became a recluse purely because for me, I needed nothing. I started off in life with the desire to discover the ongoing thing in my life then became to find love. I found it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=324s)

Amazing. That's amazing. But that's a lot, you know, the most of our families never found it, as you're saying.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=332s) 

I have introduced you to Debbie, and Debbie is the most beautiful person. There's a brave person who has suffered dearly, and a lot because of me.

I'm so ashamed.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=348s)

You don't need to be ashamed for being a traumatized person, right? For being someone who was abused. There's no shame in being abused.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=360s)

No, there isn't. But to deal with it is a difficult thing, to realize that you are a child to begin with, and then as you develop, you develop with those traumas that create for a person who's possibly regarded as unstable.

And here I am, showing you that emotion right from the start, because I know what I've got to say is going to take me some time. It's not going to be easy, and it's not something that I ever want to talk about. When I first met Debbie, our agreement was that we would not talk about our past. We'd never discuss nor judge. Because the thing that I was passionate about is, and I have found it really difficult, is the brethren judge.

And I grew up judging so many people. I regret not staying in there just to make the difference because I'm a fighter. I'm a person that won't be stood down or spoken down or allowed to be controlled.

It's the reason why I say that is because I was totally brainwashed and totally believed everything I was told. I learned to read the Bible back to front, upside down, in every way. I could quote scripture to the nth degree. I'm talking about, and the best way I'll explain it to you in a simple manner is, I learned at a very young age, before seven, of how to rehearse the Bible. Why I say that is because Genesis is excellent, but because Numbers, do you know what I mean? I can go on right through to Revelation. I can give you birth, I can quote you every...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=491s)

I feel that because often when we're in a circumstance where we've been abused or we're infants, right, trying to figure out and put together what's happening around us, we turn to the only thing we had, and that is the Bible in there. And you are, you know, with God or with the Bible, trying to find reasoning and put into perspective what's happening around you. And therefore you do, you do go and learn. When you said that, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=521s) felt that because I too, you know, went through every part of the Bible. I was learned as to the Bible because I wanted to put into perspective what was happening around me. So I hear you.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=533s)

I wanted to understand why I was so vile.

I refuse to read the Bible. I refuse to do technology.

I'm going to explain to you that my father had a printing business that had seven stories. He employed hundreds of brethren, and when they withdrew from him, they withdrew from him so severely that we didn't even know why. I was a child that came home from Tamworth visiting my grandparents, and already our bags were packed, of course, because we've been away, and they didn't get shipped into that house, they got shipped into cars.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=588s)

So just to let our viewers know, your family, your parents were born, were part of the brethren, and and by because of that, you were...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=595s)

I'll explain it like this. My grandfather, first of all, lived in Adelaide and married Adeline Johnson, and he had a milk run, Ideal Dairy.

In the long term, he then came to Melbourne to start up printing because he was a typesetter printer and he wanted to make a go of it, and he did. The difference is that he bought, moved up, shall I say, from a backyard sort of setup, included all his family into the business and a lot of brethren. My grandfather was a very kind and generous man. I recall, to explain to you the type of person he was.

He owned the building and he was very affluent.

They worked hard, both my grandmother and things, but I never met my grandmother. She died, and that's where the changes came in our lives because we had a stepmother, and my stepmother was Mary Joyce Bradbury, then Dover, then Macmillan, and people that know that she married the Macmillan from Ballarat.

The reason why I say that is because that's where I made mention to you that we came home from Tamworth and we were shipped out, and we were moved into Joyce's home, my step-grandmother, and Sarah being my step-auntie. She's younger than me, but we moved in [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=714s) her. And the best way I'd explain it to you is my grandfather died basically a pauper because he appropriated all his wealth to the family members to avoid paying taxes on death duties and all that sort of thing. It was a common thing, I assume, but my point would be that he died basically with only a gold [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=744s), which I still have. I got given that later on in life because it was very dear to me. I love that man because he taught me a good lesson.

When we were standing at the front door of the Dover building, the Dover building is a seven-story building in Melbourne. It is a National Trust building. It's a solid concrete, I don't think a bomb could blow it up. The reason for that was hot metal was done in Ludlow, which is a kind of zinc and lead melt. They had melting pots, and then what they do is they form the [typeset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=790s), and in turn, they'd print all the Reader's Digest, Penguin books, typeset and print all the newspapers throughout Australia and Australasia.

I was brought up to proofread, so I was very good at reading, which is the reason why a reference to my ability to read Bible back to front, learn the hymns in the hymn book verbatim. For example, I'll give you an example, and number eight was, "Oh God, we acknowledge," and I can go on, but I can sing that song. I can sing every song [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=835s) for word and go through the whole thing, not that I can sing. We've got to see the funny side of things, I definitely can't sing.

My point was, grandfather stood at the front door as a child, he said to me, "You know, look at that man. He sweeps my road, my laneway, so immaculately. You know, I wish there were people like that that I could engage with." And I said, "Well, why can't you?" He [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=865s), "Well, I could." He said, "How about we try?" So he called the man over. He said, "I want to thank you for sweeping the laneway." He said, "I am so proud of you." The man said, "Thank you." We had a wheelie with a bin in it and a big, big yard broom, and he said, "You know," my grandfather said to him, "You know, why do you do this?" He goes, "Well, because I'm [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=895s) at it." He said, "Have you ever thought of developing your expertise in other ways? Because," he says, "with your particulars, you'd be useful to me. Would you be interested in being engaged?" And in turn, he said, "Yes, I would. I'd love to better myself." He said, "I'd be so grateful if you give me a job." My grandfather said, "When you're employed, when would you like to start?" He said, "I'd start straight away, but I need to show respect."

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=926s) my grandfather said, "Oh, I'm all for that." He said, "How long do you need?" He said, "Well, I need to give him a notice." He then became a very influential person in that business. He had such skills that could take over the management in ways that would show up most of the brethren their character because this man was genuine, honorable, [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=957s), compassionate, meticulous, all the things my grandfather expected from most of us.

The difference was, I don't believe my grandfather was a mean-spirited person in any way. I'll give you examples of why I say that, is because the slag and the leftovers from the melting pot were always cleaned out, and he made sure that the brethren that, shall I say, were [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=987s) at the time, he made sure that they got that free, and they could start up a scrap business. And that was Jeff and Graham Fish.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=998s)

Oh, I don't know. Could you tell us a little bit about how, what happened? You said you came back and your parents were confined? Or your father was?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1012s)

That's in 1972\. The reason why I'm saying this is because it developed my look as to always willing to help people. 

I used to do parking in Camberwell Church. That was a big church in Melbourne. And I was passionate about making sure that the spaces were kept for people that had disabilities or struggled to walk far or whatever. And that gave me an insight into certain people that I would communicate with, and that's where I want to sort of start the story. Given that my parents, my parents and my [grandparents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1058s) engaged with a lot of brethren and had them employed, it wasn't just about brethren. My grandfather always treated everyone well.

The point I make to you in that is that I doubt there's a person that would ever criticize the hospitality of my family. My family, I believe, were very generous. I for one was very generous. If I went to fellowship meetings or three-day [meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1089s), I would always leave a gift under my pillow. But I was a particular person who would strip my bed, fold up the blankets, and leave my washing folded or offered to do the washing because I was brought up to do that sort of thing. Meaning that it was, shall I say, a disciplinary measure that we were, shall I say, taught how to do things most emphatically.

I'll give you an example on that too, is [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1119s) used to clean 34 pairs of shoes, and if you couldn't see your face in it, I copped a belting for it.

That's a little hot.

And my parents were very, shall I say, I mean, my mother used to wear cashmere clothes, and she had the best of crocodile shoes and, you know, the kid hide and very, shall I say, she was a very fortunate person to marry into my father, father's family, because she had need of nothing. The reason why I bring this up to you [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1162s) in 1965, it's as far back as I can go as to the abuse.

But the reason why I say it is because in 1966, my mother fell ill severely with cancer. She had lymph node cancer, which meant that she had to have her lymph nodes taken, and she had a mastectomy for both her breasts to be removed. And in the long term, she had over 18 scars over her body of [mammoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1198s) proportion. Why I say this to you is because if you think about it, 1965, I was five years of age. When I was, I'd been abused by Melva Jean Cox, many times by Brian Baker and Alf McAlpin over a long period of my life. Why I say it is [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1228s) it had a huge impact.

I'm going to say it like it was.

My abuse was every day, not only physically, sexually, but in a place that most people wouldn't listen to, wouldn't hear me out, didn't believe me. Even my own parents conveyed to me that I was the devil's child. I believe that. And I said to him, "Well, which one of you is the devil?" We can laugh about that, but I was serious because I wanted to know who I was most like. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1274s) wanted to know why I was born the devil, why I could be a brethren, could read the Bible back to front, upside down, rehearse all the hymns, know all the ministry, debate them.

### [**Ben**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1295s) **Woodbury**

I was just going to say, are you saying you're in this point of the story, how old were you?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1301s)

I was seven. Seven, whereby Alan Gadsden encouraged me and used to give me money to be able to do it and to be proudly be able to. Now, my first preaching in Campbell alone, I preached in many churches and I was pretty emphatic. My first preaching was Numbers 32, verse 23\.

“Be sure your sin will find you out.”

Why I say that is, because that's all I said.

Now, they've piled up the... there were boxes that old people used to put their feet on to rest themselves up so they sat comfortably in the chair and in the seats that were in Camberwell church. They were individual green chairs, they were fairly harsh, and people used to bring in cushions and whatever you to sit on because the chairs weren't the most comfortable. Later on, they got remodeled and [changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1370s) and the acoustics and everything changed in that church. But my point is, I was promoted into a, shall I say, fixated, totally brainwashed person who even believed that I was a saint.

So the best way to explain it is because I knew so much about the Bible and read all the ministry and kept up with it and didn't let anything go by and felt very comfortable to be able to basically preach, and it was taken advantage of. I was Alan Gadsden's little, shall I say, right-hand boy, or a boy that would sit beside him in the church.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1416s)

The reason why I say, how old were you when you first preached? Seven. Seven. Oh, wow. And you...Sorry, you're saying in the same breath, you had your family saying you're the devil, and you're seven years old, suffering abuse, and you get up and say, "Be sure your sin will find you out." What happened to, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, you know? What happened to that? You're an innocent child.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1445s)

The point I'll make to you is that affected a lot of people in that church and was remembered for a long time by a lot of people because it was infallible. It was very deliberate, and it was chosen because I was a very lost soul. Even though I had a great visage, I was quite capable and virtually had verbal diarrhea, let's just say it like that, because for me, I could just rattle it off, and I still can.

I get emotional [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1476s) starting with this because I know what's coming is a lot to be said, and it's confronting you guys that I've never spoken to before. Remember, too, I never told my wife anything.

I think that's sad, but is because my wife has suffered dearly because the brethren have intruded into our lives in many ways, and I'd like to go into that later. But for the purpose of where we're at, seven years of age, I did all that. And I really did truly love all brethren, all of them, not one. It didn't matter whether I sat beside Robbie Allpress, who was a [disabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1520s) person who used to slobber gob all over me. I still loved him. I would allow him to kiss me on the lips because I was used to being kissed, hugged against my will because of the abusers that kept doing what they did to me. It was relentless.

I've heard so many people suffer, but seriously, I didn't have the support of my family. I still don't. I have nothing to do with them. I don't want to have to do with anyone because I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed of walking away. And I always ask the question, does anyone know, do any of the brethren know why I was withdrawn from them? Because I'd like to know. All I did [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1572s) walk away because when I got old enough, I'd achieved a great deal of ability that was independent.

I was always an independent person. I was always running away from home. I was always trying to get away from everyone. I didn't like anyone, even though I loved them. I know that sounds contradictory, but let me tell you, when you're brainwashed, you only feared [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1602s) fact that I was going to hell.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1607s)

We can all relate to that, right?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1608s)

It's so awful when you know, abuse, child abuse is the worst of the worst, but to add the mental, religious abuse as well, that you're a bad person for being abused, that is, it's so evil.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1627s)

And psychologically, right, you are holding up a mirror to that community and the people, your family, and for them to admit that you're correct, you've got to understand is for them to admit their role in it. So if they have failed you as a child, which, you know, I have so many people that have reached out to me that I've helped and people that have helped leave that have [such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1657s) a similar story, Mick, it's unbelievable here in Australia, such a similar story. And I was just speaking with a woman, probably your age, she just reached out and said to me a very similar story here and and in and in that same time frame. So it's, I just, hats off to you and thank you for sharing it with us. And I know, I know it's probably a lot for you to unpack, but this is a safe landing pad where we're all very in touch with our emotions. I've had to keep muting [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1688s) thing because it, it's very touching what you're saying. So I just wanted to say thank you for doing that.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1693s)

I come on here purely because I don't want another person to not have a refuge, somewhere to go, someone to talk to, someone to communicate the pain and suffering that lingers in me every day. I can't shake it. I'll never get rid of it. I'm going to have to live with it. No one can do anything about that. I've got to manage that. I've had to manage it all my life. Not being believed is one of the hardest things when you [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1723s) brought up to be a believer. It's so contradictory. It's so distraughting to believe that you are a believer when knowing I lived a lie. I actually never was myself. I'm still not myself because I'm not free. I haven't got past the love. I just want peace. My goal, third goal in life is to have peace. I have [attempted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1753s) to take my life many times.

So many times. I can tell you exactly what I did. I'll give you an example of one. Windsor Crescent, I hung myself.

Windsor Crescent was a church. I got access into it because you could pick the lock.

And I hung myself. And Paul Baker, an older man in the Brethren, found me, and he took me down, and he took me to his home, which was just across the road and up the road a little bit. And he said to me, "Mick, what made you do this?" And I told him. He says, but I said to him before, I said it to him, before I told him, I said, "You can't tell anyone else because no one else believes me. And I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to feel dirty. I don't want to feel disgusting."

I just want to do it the way I feel. I don't want to hurt anybody else. I've lived my life not wanting to harm another. I have, I know that.

But I never intended to. I've never intentionally done anything to anyone.

But it's happened in maybe my terse curse words to Debbie, for example, or my kids or something, because a smell or a taste or an atmosphere of any kind in my life brings back recollections or memories of things I can't deal with, that I can't shake. I just can't. For example, when a woman is filthy and she's not clean and I've got to act [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1862s) her, remove her personal things and put them in the bin and then have her hug me and kiss me and tell me to touch her. I did that from a young age, and it's the smell, the stink, those things just repulse me so much. And this woman's still alive.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1892s)

And this is the abuser?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1893s)

Yeah, Melva Jean Cox. Now, I want you to know something, that she's done everything in her power to keep this closed and shut me down and whisked me away. And my parents used to see to it that I went to people's homes and stayed with them and got away and whatever to find me a friend.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1910s)

How did she first have access to you? Yeah, I was going to say, do you mind if we back this up a bit?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1916s)

Yeah, I get off of the table. That's all right. It's a lot to say. I don't care. It's never been said before, so it's raw. And I've no plan written. I've got nothing in front of me. I can guarantee to you this is coming straight from my shoulders and from my heart, from my mouth, and from the horse's mouth. Not made up. I can give you evidence of everything I've got to say. I have written evidence. I have [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1946s). I have signatures. I have everything that I'm about to say to converse with you.

I went to the police so many times. I went to Kew police station, I could describe them. I went to the Glenferry station, I went to the South Melbourne police station, for example, and I was shunned by them or, shall I say, pursued by brethren or my parents to shut me down, to not discuss it, not that I was delusional. There was a power of attorney taken out on me to destroy my life so that I could never... I found out later that it was an enduring power of attorney, which means that they were administrators to my life, the whole thing. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=1996s) never found out exactly who they are, but I know my parents were part of it to begin with. The reason why I say this is because I lost everything that I ever worked for. I walked out of the prison with nothing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2011s)

How old were you when you left?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2013s)

I left at 22 years of age. The reason why I left was because of... and I'd rather leave that to a later conversation because we'll get to that. It's step by step over years because the best way to explain to you is at seven years of age, I was, and I've got the scars to prove it. I was bypassed to hospitals to go to a clinic to be sewn up, [64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2043s) internal and 64 external stitches to close up my body because I was thrown or shoved or the door was pushed open to a bathroom. Now, I had been put in that room, which was called the visitors' room, in a disciplinary measure, and I had to have my bath and shower. The story was that I slipped and fell, but that's not the case.

[The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2073s) point I make to you is the glass was wired glass, the old-fashioned wire glass, criss-cross in them, and there's no way you could slip and fall through that on your own, a little boy. But the reason why I bring this to your attention is I'd been disciplined into that room at the time because I was insubordinate. I was angry with the way I was treated. I was [subjected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2104s) to an old woman, an Aboriginal woman that lived in our home named Kramer. I was subjected to an old man called Thorney. I can't tell you his full name because I don't know his Christian name, but Thorn was the surname. And the old man was a, shall I say, an old part. Like for most of us, that was really difficult. You had to be respectful. But my parents were, shall I say, [best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2134s) considerate of taking in people and very hospitable.

Given that, that's the reason why Jean Cox came into our lives. And I'll explain it to you like this. When my grandmother was close to dying, she died blind and she kept burning herself. So they engaged Jean Cox. She came from Warrnambool. Jean Cox was taken into my grandfather's home. She was brethren. And she always has been [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2164s). She's been withdrawn from or whatever, shut up, I'm not sure of all the ins and outs. But my whole point is, out of the goodness of their heart, my grandfather took her in to get help, my grandmother, move about the house and do cooking and cleaning and whatever.

My reasoning for saying it was that when she died, the brethren made it quite clear that a single, a widower and a single woman couldn't live together. So my parents took her in. Along came with Jean, later came after the old people died, meaning that Kramer and Thorn... no, came in also Gwen Wooster. She was Gwen Cox. That's Jean's... Jean is [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2211s) auntie to her, and that was part of what my family did, is they took in, shall I say, people that may have been under duress or whatever for all sorts of reasons. Jean came from a fairly poor family at the time, and given that she was given a room on her own that was right next to that.

But in 1966, Jean Cox and my father bonked. I don't know whether you know what I mean when I say [bonked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2241s), but they fucked. And I know it sounds crude to me, but I've got to say it that way because I opened that door because I was such an organized kid. I had my pyjamas folded, my knickers folded, my singlet was folded. I was very meticulous about things, but I forgot my knickers that time, and I went to open the door and saw them bonking. My mother was up in the front bedroom, in the master bedroom, with the cancer just diagnosed and was really suffering with it. So she wasn't in a situation where she just came out of hospital, and my brother, my youngest brother, was just born in 1966\.

Why I say it to you is because everything's very pivot with me. I've got so many markers to prove and to show and to express that I can be meticulous about it, but I get it confused whilst I'm emotional. But if given a time, if I was to put down the timeline, which I refuse to do because it's just too much on my end, but given that it's constantly coming up in my life, all the things that happened and I've never been listened to. There's nowhere in the Brethren that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2324s) can go to to be listened to. Even back then in Brougham Street, I was constantly in trouble, always struggling. I've got a scar on my hand here where I jumped on a gate purely to get away from Brian Baker, and he pulled me down. I'll never forget that.

I was seven at the time prior to this happening, and this is why I was disciplined, because I was put into that business room as a punishment.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2362s)

As a way to get some, sorry to interrupt again, just to get some perspective, where is your parents in all this? Are they in the house?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2369s)

They're in the house. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2372s)

And then are you staying at other people's homes or?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2376s)

Not at that time, but this is the lead up to it, is because I was always a very displaced person because I was always running away, always causing trouble, it's the best way of saying it. Always challenged everything. I never shut up. I honestly can tell you, I was probably the rudest, crudest, naughtiest boy, and even David Stewart, my my uncle, said to me, "You know how you were, Mick?"

Well, I was only the way I was because of the product of an outcome. I wanted to go on with it because at seven years of age, that makes me 1967, was when that particular time happened. So you understand the timeline is 1965 is where I can remember being abused, and she made me fondle her and touch her and kiss her and cuddle her and all that and massage.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2431s)

So this is while Jean lived in your family home?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2433s)

Our home. She did it, but she used to deprive me of things. For example, I'll explain it to you like this: I was a vulnerable kid to lollies. The things she used to offer me, for example, was throaties, Tarzan jubes, Irish moss, Mates, licorice. And if I didn't perform the way she wanted, she would discipline me physically. We're talking about belt the living out of me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2464s)

And am I right to assume if you didn't perform what she wanted, as in like sexual...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2471s)

In sexual acts. Why I say that is because she had disgusting boobs that stunk underneath. She always smelt down there in the crotch. And what I'm saying to you is it was always this repulsive feeling for me. I grew up later not sure who I was or what my sexuality was even, because I had doubts whether I was even going to be liked or loved.

I go through that because I know that there's a lot of gay people that have come out of the brethren and have found their way in some way. But my point was, I've never had the ability to be myself because I had to discover who I was as I went, rather than because things were forced on me that I absolutely loathe, resent, and can't deal with even today talking about. But I'm doing it for a purpose.

And the important part of all this is that as I move on, 1967, seven years of age, is when I ended up through the shower screen. I was taken to the Ivano clinic. The three doctors that were there that performed this. We parted it. I've already said that. The way I say it is that I went to the Ivano clinic, and I had this 64 internal and external stitches. I felt every one of them because they didn't have enough time to sew me up to survive. [I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2572s) lost so much blood. I was bundled into the car and taken there by my mother who was not even able to drive, but she went with Jean Cox. And Jean Cox knew what happened, but the story came, my mother got the towels that were set there beautifully folded by me and my clothes and tourniquet my body so that I got bundled into the Chev and taken to that [clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2602s).

And the reason why I say that is there were eight people held me down. Now, why I'm saying this, this part of the story, is because it's emphatic that you understand later on when I tell you about my experience at Maroondah Hospital. Why I say that is later on, long time later as an adult.

My point is that in doing that, I can name the doctors. I even had Dr. Andrew Fraser come and apologize to me whilst working in my wife's shop in the Boronia Mall, and he said, "You know, I've got a lot to be sorry for." I said, "Well, you can't be. I don't accept your apology. I wish you'd report it."

But I wasn't prepared to do it because I didn't want to explain to my wife what had happened or why I was like I was, and I didn't want to go into the brethren. I wanted to take it. I just didn't want anyone to know anything about my past. I went out of my way to deny telling my wife that I was where I lived or where I came from, given the fact that when we first got together, we agreed not to talk about our past and not to involve [ourselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2679s) because it complicates life and I didn't want it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2683s)

That is the case, Mick, with a lot, a lot of people that leave. We hear that a lot, particularly if you've suffered trauma. I mean, nothing like by the sounds of what you've been through, but you do try and put as much distance and space between you and the place of trauma, so it's understandable that you didn't want to speak about it.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2700s)

Well, the, but the reason why I want to say it to you is that I got abused in just about every church in Melbourne, Geelong, Berwick, Sunbury, you name it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2711s)

Everywhere.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2712s)

Everywhere, by priests, so-called priests, or all the older persons. Given that I haven't named everyone because I, I just, you know, it's already humiliated. It became like I was a sex tool, and I was so ashamed of being vulnerable to that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2735s)

Do you, can I ask, do you think they all were in the know? Like, is it some sort of...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2741s)

Of course they are. And I'll explain to you why. When it happened in Brougham Street, for example, I crawled, cried out for help, and I'd rather talk about that in a moment. Yeah, I'm talking about the discovery in 1967 as a seven-year-old. I was disciplined into the, into that visitor's room. I was actually fed bread and water as a form of discipline [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2771s) days in my parents' homes, 

**Lane Admiraal**

Because who was, who was responsible for this? Was this Jean Cox bringing you the food and water? 

**Mick Dover**

Jean Cox, my father, and my mother knew some of the things. My mother was fairly hard. She was sick, but she was sick, so I give her some lenience. I think my father, just so you know, I'll get to the other things that have happened in our [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2801s) our family's life, but the best example is now I'm, I'm seven, that happened, and I got stitched up and brought home, and I was locked back up in that room. And it was because if I talked, more people had probably doubt about what happened and why the cause of that happened. But the story went around that I slipped in the bath because there was a shower over a bath.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2833s)

But I know, ask, is Jean Cox the same age as your parents? Like, how old were your parents and Jean Cox at this time?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2838s)

I'll give you an idea, she's about 90 now, and I don't know what, but I'll give you an idea. My father was born in 1930, all right? I'm not sure, but she, let's call it 1936, 1940 max, she was born. All right, I don't know, a similar age. I really don't care. The best way of saying it, I really don't give a shit. Yeah, right. I really don't care. I don't want to know about it. I'll tell you about stories about what she did [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2868s) manipulation.

The reason why I say that is to, as we go through, go through the things, you'll understand more. It's probably a long story to tell, but it's in, I don't want to be made short. I'm not going to say it, but the way I can say it is in my own way that explains suffering, the pain at the hands of brethren that knew, that denied knowing today, and always out that I was filthy, I was insubordinate, dishonest, deprecator, the worst of things. How can a believer be a believer knowing that?

And it was done by people that should have known better or should have listened. When I say that done is that people that were told, I'll give you an example, David Johnson was another person that I was billeted to whilst my parents were around and not withdrawn from, because it was a way to keep me under an older man's, he was a retired man and he was a disciplinary person. Another person I had stayed with [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2942s) Mr. Maslin, who took me to the RAAF thing down there in Avalon Airport, whereby I got an interest in that. And why I say that is because it was like a distraction or a deliberate attempt to give me another outlet whereby they could cover up things.

The reason why I say this is people must have known, and I know they know, but I can't prove it. [Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=2972s) I say I can't prove it is because if they deny it, it's my word against theirs, he says, she says, whatever the case be. The important part is that I can recall all things. I have got other information that can verify it, but given that the tenor normally is to be disbelieved before you believe. And it's a struggle for me to keep the lid on it. Every day that lid pops.

I know you all may not understand that.

But my experience was for a good 10 years, if it wasn't every day, it was three times a day, I was abused.

And I'm saying by three people, sometimes all of them in the one day.

Why I say it is... They knew that the other people were abusing you? I don't know that. Well, I have an inkling they did, but I think that it's all part of the cover-up. Shall I say no one spoke about it? It's a dirty word. It's a crime and it's something that they're not going to think. Even when I went to the police, the police didn't want to hear it because of the fabrication created by the excuse made by my parents in ways that, "Oh, you can't offend the Dovers. The Dovers are too high and [mighty."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3064s) Do you get me? And if you understand my wealth, my parents' wealth and everything was extreme.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3071s)

We're talking about the...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3072s)

The best way I say to you is back in, I've got a tax return that's right here that I've got that I paid two months after I was born, 500 pounds in tax.

So they were definitely skimming or taking a load of money. And my parents... I've got tax returns to show you that it could be shown anytime of 2,500 given to my mother, my father, and Mary Joyce Dover, which is my step-grandmother. Why I say that is that it's important to understand that they had such wealth back then, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3120s) know, houses were maybe 5,000 pounds. So it's an extreme amount of money. The Murdochs and the Packers were regarded as scum. I don't know whether you know what I'm talking about, but Murdoch, yeah, well, I'm, you know, they were regarded as scum, and my parents were affluent over the top on every level.

My father was an extremely heavy drinker. My mother was [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3150s) cup drinker and an extremely heavy drinker. And Jean was worse than all of them. And why I say that was, Jean... 

**Lane Admiraal**

Was Jean mostly drunk when she abused you? 

**Mick Dover**

Yes. Yes. And horrific. Like she flogged me, and I'm talking about flogged me. I used to have my pants pulled down and felt that was to the point where I was told, "If you keep it up, I'll make sure you don't walk again."

And believe me, I've got scars on my ass to show it.

Like I said, I've got scars on my back, I've got scars on my body, all I have to prove. I'm not ashamed of it, but what I am angry about is even today, from the penetration of men's penis into my backside, I have grapes sticking out of them. I can't even control my own shit. And I don't know whether any of you understand that, but that is cruel to live with in your old age. I can't fart without shitting.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3221s)

So sorry.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3222s)

I don't want to wear a nappy, but guess what? I'm gonna have to soon.

Do you know how embarrassing that is? There are stories of calling me Mickey Drippin as a kid, and Jocelyn John can verify this because she used to jokingly say that to me, that they used to call you Mickey Drippin. The reason is because I would be plonked somewhere and I'd stay there and I pissed myself and no one had changed me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3256s)

And just the neglect, the absolute neglect of a child. It's just heartbreaking.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3260s)

We'll get into that because you understand that neglect has always been there. We were servants to my parents, particularly I was, and we were servants to... I was a servant to Jean. I was a servant to the brethren in many ways, and I'll explain that as I'll get through. I know I'm taking a lot of your time, and I'm sorry for this, but it's important for me to say it because I've got a problem. I still want to take my life, and I know that sounds crazy, but no one understands [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3291s) wretched I feel. And I've got to say it while I'm in my living years, because when my father died, he called for me, and I said, "No, I don't want to go and see him. I don't want to talk to him because he should have done that in my living years." If he wanted to apologize, he wanted to fix things, he should have. The same with my mother.

I don't have the emotional feelings most people would have with their parents. I have resentment.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3316s)

I have resentment. I can, I can agree, I can hear you on that one. You know, a lot of people are like, yeah, but your parents must still love you. You must still love your parents. No. No, you don't have to.

**Mick Dover**

 Belt  the shit out of me and then say, "Oh, I'm sorry, my son," and belt the shit out of you again because I retaliated by going, "No, you're not. You're not even my father." And he would go, "Don't talk to me like that," and wham, it'd go on. So not long after apologizing, it'd be straight back to the same shit.

I told hundreds of brethren. I told all sorts of brethren. I've written names down of when it happened, how it happened, why, because I want something to be resolved in all this. Alf McAlpin raped me. Brian Baker raped me. Jean Cox raped me. And all I want to say to you is they got away with it. Those two men are dead. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3376s) only found out recently, but I was hoping to expose them. And Jean Cox is 90 years of age, and I'd like to expose her.

I can't be responsible for all that went on, but what I can do is to let what the brethren do as a cult be exposed for what it is. It's brainwashing, fucked up, that has caused so much angst for me and my whole life. Breaking of bread and being refused to break [bread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3406s) at places, and I'll get to that story later on. No, I know my wife's getting quite agitated because she's hearing that she hasn't heard, and she's going to keep hearing more.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3420s)

Yeah, I can understand it would be a lot. But your story is like, like, thank you so much. I can't... like say it enough, just for you to share it. Like, it's incredibly brave, and I think what you're going to be is the catalyst for a lot of people your age to get some sort of reconciliation.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3439s)

That's what I'm doing for, is because I know there are so many that have been abused. There are people that I grew up, and there are still people being abused. I'll get to that story later on about somebody I met not long ago, and her words were to me, I said to her, "Why are you crying?" And I won't mention the name because I wouldn't like to offend that person because they're in, and she's married, and she's got children.

And she said to me, "You know, Mick, you know, Mick, of all people, you know my father." And I go, "Yeah, I know." But I haven't told them that, see, because it's become a thing for me. I understood. I knew that I was a pincushion. I could be pricked, shoved, punched, whatever you wanted to do to me. I had to learn to accept. Throw yourself at the feet of the Lord Jesus and ask for forgiveness. I want to know why the fuck I've got to ask for forgiveness. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3499s) don't deserve this. I didn't deserve it.

And I've got to move on because I need to tell you the rest of my life. I then want to make a point of going and fast forward it because it happened so often and so many times. I can give you the churches where it happened. I can give you the type of things by going up to the unit and all them being hugged and groped and played with. And I can tell you where I went in to lock the door and the door would be [unlocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3530s) because they'd use one particular, Brian Baker, I'll say it to you because I've got to say the names, used his nail file on their key to open up the, you know, vacancy... not vacant, you know, yeah, like a...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3547s)

Stall.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3547s)

Right. But the toilet door. And my point is that he'd come in behind it and lock it, and then and his way. That's right, in the meeting hall, in the meeting hall, the Camberwell meeting hall in Charlotte. I can name the ones. I just don't want to go there too much because it is cluttering my conversation with you and you know, we've got more time to come back at this. I want to question and answer and question time with anyone that wants to [challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3578s) me because I'm going to be crude, rude, and undesirable with my explanations. I'm going to tell you exactly how it happened. I'm going to tell you what was to be penetrated against your will. You know, we're talking about raw. We're talking about real crude abuse that's not even prepped for abuse. It's just wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, walk away and leave me in a pile.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3609s) want to move on. I then go into 1972, where my father was withdrawn from for being exposed in the Truth newspaper. Tycoon... I can't even think of the words now because it's too much. Business tycoon, yeah, tycoon exposed. And you can pull up the newspaper, it's there. And it was my father that exposed himself to a woman. Now, he didn't, though. The story [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3642s) that he didn't, that he was with Frank Adams, the manager of the Dover's business at the time. He was, he took a leak. He took a leak on a tree because my father was a piss head. So you know, if you get drunk, you've got to have a piss, and when you've got to have a piss, you've got to have a piss. I can relate to it.

But he also typeset and printed that newspaper, didn't have a choice, but defended himself because he had plenty of money to shut the story down, regardless [whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3672s) it was true or not. But my parents, my father was withdrawn from, and why I say that is because it's indicative that he couldn't care less, bigger than his own shoes. He was a spoilt brat, and that's the simplest way to say it. He had the golden spoon, and he abused it. He thought he was more powerful than anyone. He could buy your paper. He could shut you down. He used to support Alan Gadsden and [John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3704s) Hales and Bruce Hales with maintaining their cars and buying tires and cars for them and doing great things for the whole lot of them. But my reason for coming on here is to mostly talk about my sexual abuse, but to... 

My reasoning for coming on here is because of the abuse that consistently happened and particularly became relentless by these other men, meaning, and they regard them as priests, being, Brian Baker, I don't think was ever a priest, but Alf McAlpin was, and he was an affluent, influential person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3756s)

And the McAlpin name still is, like it's meant to mean something.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3760s)

Well, the reason why I say it to you is at one point there when I was abused with him, I was billeted to his house and I had to live with him.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3772s)

Because you were separated from your parents.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3775s)

I was separated from my parents that go from the fat to the fire. What I said to you is, in 1972, we moved into Joyce Dover's home, which was my grandfather's home to begin with, right, in Forlorn Grove and Camberwell. And the reason for me saying that is all of us, except for my sister who was already married, she was married at 15 and 9 months. She was married to a Howard Kennard, who was 30 years old at the time.

It was all consented and agreed to and even got government acceptance by extenuating circumstances, whatever it is, bought or paid for to happen with the consent and thing of the establishment of Melbourne. And Alan Gadsden was a powerful broker at that time, the rival later on, along with the Hales, if you understand the brethren. But the point I make to you in that is that they were very [commercially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3839s) driven monsters, and they took advantage of my father's stupidity of gifting and supporting all these people because my father was not well liked because he was outrageously ostentatious. He was, shall I say, flamboyant. He was definitely...

The reason why the brethren disciplined him later on is because of the [size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3869s) of our homes, the way he had the big building in the city, and it had on it the Dover building, which, by the way, I'll explain to you, was left to four boys.

Four boys, being my brother Richard, myself, Paul, and I'm saying it in age gaps, and Brendan.

And none of us have ever seen it.

And my father took Debbie past all these properties that he owned and previously owned or owned. And Debbie asked him one day, "Where did all your money go?"

And he responded, "Kent Street Properties." Kent Street Properties was a brethren trust. It was a trust that controlled all the churches.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3924s)

And who, and who set that up? Who's Kent Street Trust run by?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3928s)

From my understanding, was originally set up by Giles Allpress. The reason why I used Giles Allpress is because you'll understand that he was the one that took the care meetings and and did all the accountancy. He actually, him and Phil Moody, who later moved to Albury, were originally the people that did the care meeting and the books for the brethren because they were also connected [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=3958s) um, you know, the people that do the triple-A ratings for the government. You know, when they do the chartered accountants. Yeah, he worked, Charles Allpress worked for them. And why I'm saying this is as we go through, you'll understand that this explains some of the things that went on with my family.

And part of the cover-up with the brethren was, and I, why I've been, shall I say, definitely ostracized and prevent it from, or shall I say, any way that they're going to have me restored is to compromise the position and that I, you know, I've been even told, "If I come back, I'll buy a house for you. If you come in, you'll never have to work again. If you do this," it's always a bribery.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4015s)

That’s like saying, "Hey, do you want to come back to maximum security prison? We got free commissaries." You know, like we got, we got a free commissary.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4023s)

I mean, and on top of that, you've got to sit opposite and have a list, you know, break bread with probably your perpetrator on it, you know.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4031s)

Yeah, I actually had to break bread with these assholes. And the reason they even tried to get Debbie in there, and while just after she had a major brain injury, they coerced her into the point where she was going to go and sit in the brethren at Gedonia Street in Boronia. And they were organized for her to go to the church, and against my will, that I was not part of. I didn't want to be part of it. I want to hear why they were doing this. And Debbie was never a brethren, so she was never going to fit in. She told them that that she won't fit in, that she will never be able to be a brethren because she's an independent woman [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4079s) begin with.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4080s)

Independent women, no, no, Debbie, they won't like you there. So, Mick, do you think... Mick, do you think they were trying to get you back in order to somehow put a lid on the experiences you went through, to try and keep that under wraps?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4096s)

Debbie will tell you her story at a time. Look, I think it would be valuable to hear Debbie's take on it all because it's probably a person from our point of view. All right, that's why I'm saying it to you. That is not influenced by me, doesn't take crap from me. So it definitely won't take it from you or anyone else.

I love her more than you can imagine because she's the first and only person that's been emphatically honest with me. She holds nothing back. I admire that because I can deal with honesty. It doesn't matter how it comes, doesn't matter how much it hurts. It's in your face, and it's going to happen. Well, it's genuine. It's genuine. That's it. This is, you know, now I'm a believer. Do you get me? [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4151s) I believe in it. I truly have found love. She's amazing. She's even been told she's God's sister. I'd like you to hear her story because it's quite crazy.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4166s)

We'll have to, we'll have to get another podcast on and get Debbie and the girls on.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4170s)

This is not going to end with just my podcast today, and I'm hoping you've got a long time to talk through this. I hope you guys don't mind spending a long time talking about this because I don't care what's presented. It's really important for me to say it once, get it out, and if I need to do more, I will add to it. And if I get challenged, I'd love anyone to come forward out of the brethren, in the brethren, wherever they come from, brothers, sisters, I don't care who they are. I would love [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4200s) challenge to prove my point, times and dates and everything that goes with it, so that at some point it'll be recognized and I just might not have to ask for forgiveness, I just might be able to forgive.

The reason why I say my mother died telling my brother, "You know I forgive Mick."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4228s)

That's crazy.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4229s)

It's crazy, but that's the mentality of the brethren.

It's a cult, and you've got to know, I am so adamant, so strong about that is because where else in the world could you cover up such sin? And I gave you the examples of the abuse of getting taken off to a thing, and the doctors, I named the doctors: Dr. Andrew Fraser, I named Stark, sorry, Star, and I named Riddle. But there's nothing I can do more than [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4264s) you those names. I was taken off from the age of seven right up to the age of 14, where I refused to go anymore. I was taken twice a week to be injected with hydrofluoride.

### 

Hydrofluoric acid. I've got the bottle, so there's no question about it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4295s)

But what purpose, though?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4297s)

To suppress my sexual deviance.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4303s)

Also like a, like a castration, is it? Like a chemical... 

**Mick Dover**

Yes it is.

**Ben Woodbury**

Oh, okay. Well, nothing's changed because you know, they've done it to Craig Hoyle. He's just written a book about it.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4314s)

And and I know their purpose in doing it to me. I know what they did because it kept speaking out about being raped.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4325s)

So they did this after you spoke out about being raped.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4329s)

Oh, yes. And at seven years of age, when I was thrown through the shower screen or slipped or whatever the poor someone might put on the take, I know what happened. I caught my father and Jean bonking. And because I caught them, not only was she guilty of abusing me for those two years prior that I can 100% recall, but she's bonking my father whilst my mother's in the bed suffering from cancer [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4359s) just come out of hospital. 

So I want to move on in the years and explain to you, let's go up to the 1972 because in 1970, my grandfather died on the day the Westgate Bridge fell down, which is a big bridge here in Melbourne that's pretty high up. And when he died, I was so devastated that I can remember sitting on the bread bin and I was sobbing.

Now, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4389s) can remember as a boy, we had open coffins, open coffins, and my grandfather's was kept there because it was grave diggers' strike, and my grandfather couldn't be buried for well over, I say more than two weeks, possibly four weeks, but I can't be sure for exact. But given that if we work at, if I wanted to, I can actually prove to you the day he died, and then I can show you on his [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4421s) particulars of when he was actually buried. So it's, he was in the house exposed, and I used to kiss him all the time. He used to go there and kiss him because he just wanted to wake up.

The reason why I say that is because we used to walk past and and particularly on every Tuesday, they would have a funeral. You know, when I say particularly, they would have a funeral day whereby [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4451s) were buried on a Tuesday. And why I say that is because there's a whole lot of changes that happened in my life that were very hard for me to comprehend. And I'll start with the fact that the changes happened, for example, in the Lord's Supper, which is the Sunday morning breaking of bread and the partaking of the wine and all that crap. And it had changed in 1968\. So you can see I've got a fairly good idea [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4481s) what happened in my life.

Why I say that to you is because it was universal. The difference is, I used to question, how the hell can you tell me that it went from, and I used to say it, never swear, but and here I'm saying how the hell, but I didn't talk like that. But given the context of that part is, I could not understand where they derived the idea of getting up at 6:00 a.m., [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4511s) know, getting up at 4:00 a.m. to read the ministry or have something that would go, you go to the Lord's Supper with a purpose in mind and be able to get up there and pray and do all this, sing wonderful songs.

 I find it so, you know, I knew those songs off by heart, and I was gusto. I really let them rip because it was my outlet. There was no way that I could participate in any sports or anything that would give me the pleasure as a normal [child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4546s), given the constraints that were put on my life.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4549s)

Fulfillment, right, that comes with it. Pardon? Like the fulfillment that normal kids would have. You know, we, I too relate to that because I used to love singing at church because it was the only fulfillment that you had.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4561s)

Yes, but it was for me, it was an outlet. I was going to church to get away. I knew that it was one hour every day, but no one was going to touch me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4573s)

One hour.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4576s)

You know, I say this for a reason, 1968, is because that was after the trauma of the, the glass going right through to my chest. It went through and grazed my lungs and went between the lungs and close to my heart, and it was a really severe thing at the time. My point is, there was lies over it. And [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4606s) next part of that is the Jensens, Ron Jensen, Joan Jensen, all the locals that were at there knew about it, and they knew of it. And I want to specifically say all the locals that were there, and I can go into the names, but it'll take too much time to tell you all the locals, and I can rehearse them all.

But given that Brougham Street was one street, and then at the end of Walpole Street [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4636s) Duke Street, and that was where the Jensens went to, and Penhall's and Corris’s and and Carruthers and and I can't think of his name right now, Arkcolls all went to, right? Yeah. And the reason why I say that to you is because I have a vivid recollection of all these people. I have a vivid recollection of how I [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4667s) building my little, shall I say, savings. I used to mow lawns, and I did it for everybody and anyone really cheap so I could get money. My goal was so that I could buy my own home so I could never be living with anyone.

But we'll get through, get into that later, and I'll explain to you. We're going to move on to the 1972 situation. We moved out of our home straight into Mary Joyce Dover's home with Sarah, who has a story to tell that I'm going to tell part of it because I know it's a fact. She married also very young and married Steve Joyce, [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4718s) ended up abusing his children.

And it's never been told. And Sarah, at the age of 21, had five children. Under the age of 12, yes. 

**Richard Marsh**

Sarah is your sister?

**Mick Dover**

My step-auntie. My father's step-sister, right? But through the marriage of marrying Mary Joyce Dover, and just so you understand, the reason why Mary Joyce Dover, which was Mary Joyce Bradbury, she married my grandfather was because my [grandfather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4764s) had to marry her because John Dover bonked with her too.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4770s)

She's your step-auntie and she's four years younger. So it's really...It's quite a complex family tree there, Mick.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4779s)

It's quite so many people, but because of the money and the wealth and the extremities of covering up so much crap.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4788s)

She's a step-auntie, but she's four years younger. So similar age to you, yeah. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4792s)

So what localities were they, Mick? Like, were they?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4798s)

John Dover was Mountain Street, Camberwell, that is. Camberwell. And then Steve Joyce.. Steve Joyce was Charlotte Street until he got withdrawn from. So that's Camberwell? No, no, no. Charlotte Street's Blackburn.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4820s)

Okay. I'm just trying to like for the or anyone else listening...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4824s)

It's another church where I was raped.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4827s)

Okay.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4827s)

Get into that. I probably gone around about a lot of stuff, long-winded and a little bit...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4834s)

No, that's that's fine, Mick. I'm just trying to get like meeting names so that people my age group listening or people in there, like, is it Melbourne? Is it Melbourne main hall? Is it...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4847s)

A lot of these churches are no longer there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4849s)

Yeah, okay.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4851s)

I want you to understand that most churches I've been raped in.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4857s)

So when you say churches, I mean, just to make it clear to people who've never been in the Brethren, we're talking about the small local meeting halls that Brethren would have within a larger city.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4869s)

Yes, and the large Camberwell Church many times, by both Brian Baker and Alf McAlpin.

The reason why I say this is because I was so ashamed of myself. And now I'm not. I'm actually just a really broken man.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4892s)

But I hope by you sharing this with us, Mick, I hope you can get some healing, okay? Because, you know, you sharing this story will help other people. I guarantee that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4902s)

Undoubtedly, Mick. Undoubtedly. I like, there's there's somebody that I'd love to have a chat with you about it later, but came to me from a woman, and it's a very similar story in a similar time. So thank you. I can't say it enough.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4916s)

Well, I want to tell you that I mentioned this person that I saw in, and I don't want to mention her name because I'd like permission before I ever said it. Yeah, but she's in and she said to me, "You know, Mick, I know what happened to you." She goes, "My father raped me too, and he raped you, didn't he?" I said, "Yeah, he did." But I never mentioned it. I still haven't mentioned it, but I will one day because I just don't want to get into it. I feel like a pincushion is the best way of saying it to you. And at the end of the day, I needed to express that we were so vulnerable, and my father would [conform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4957s) to any hierarchy of the church because he just wanted to be liked. He was resented because he was so filthy rich and he inherited so easily. And given that a man, a fool and his money soon part, it's the best way to explain it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4976s)

He went, sorry, it hasn't changed at all in there, Mick. Like, it's, and I only left seven years ago, but it's the same thing. It's the people with money are resented, but they've got money, so they're powerful.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=4987s)

Oh yeah, and and they use it. They use it in the most horrific ways to defend themselves or, shall I say, the cult. They'll defend the cult. Yeah, but why I'm saying it to you is specifically, it's always to accommodate the position.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5004s)

Exactly.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5006s)

And that position, you need to understand the cult. I've spoken to people, and and and and they go, they don't understand it. I've spoken to doctors, I've spoken to all sorts of legal people, all sorts, they just don't understand a cult. The cult we're talking about is the brethren. They are very powerful. We're talking about exceptionally powerful. The important part I'd make to you in that is, if you look over some of the biggest [businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5037s) in Australia, they're owned by brethren or ex-brethren, and they were brethren at one point. You know, let's look at the Sealys, let's look at, you know, you look at the Kennards.

Kennards, yeah, you know. Okay, well, they're related now to somebody in my family. I don't know how, I can't go into it, but through David Stewart, you name it. Because just so you know, David Stewart married Eunie John. My mother was Marjorie Kilgoure John. And the reason why I wanted to explain this to you was that in 1972, the Truth newspaper [exposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5082s) my father. I believe it was an inside job because my father was vulnerable to persecution. And the point I make to you in that is specifically, my mother was Marjorie Kilgoure John, Marjorie Kilgoure Dover. My mother's name was spelled M-A-R-J-O-R-I-E, K-I-L-G-O-U-R-E. [Now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5112s) if you didn't note that, you wouldn't be able to put that into the newspaper.

Did you get me? Right. Because no, it's the family name, Kilgoure. That's the John side. Now, the reason why I'm explaining that to you is a lot of brethren in there, the powerful ones, are connected with the Johns.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5133s)

Yes.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5135s)

And even my uncles left the brethren because they didn't want to be part of the brethren. Given that I was ostracized by my uncle when I went to visit him because there was influence from the brethren in Tamworth and from my sister and others that said that I was a no-hope. I made up things, and I was always a liar and fabricator and disgusting [person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5165s), a pervert, sicko.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5166s)

And that's the label they give every single victim.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5171s)

Yes… 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5173s)

And then they kick the victim out of the church.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5174s)

Yeah, there's no, you're not, you're not regarded as a victim. You're regarded as a perpetrator. You are personally vile.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5186s)

And meanwhile, you know, you've got these adults raping five-year-old children.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5192s)

That's exactly... the brethren, the brethren don't know how to use English properly. What what they say is, "Oh, sounds like a case of sin coming in." What they mean is, "It sounds like we have a pedophile on the loose and we need to call the police," right? But they don't do that. They say it's sin and it's your fault. "Oh, it sounds like some sin came in." No, you have a cult full of pedophiles that need to be locked up and severe amounts of therapy, but [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5222s) lock them up.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5224s)

For them to admit that would be for them to, you know, take part, like take their ownership on it, right? Yeah, another universe maybe.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5232s)

And that's what I, that's what I want them to actually do, is to acknowledge so that I can actually forgive, because I'm willing to. I'm a bigger person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5244s)

And you know, Mick, you don't ever have to, to be honest. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm with anybody…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5249s)

I think sometimes if if you feel that it gives you a release, sure. But I've struggled with that. Like, you know, I did this therapy thing where I wrote down, "I forgive you," to my parents, literally like a thousand times on a piece of paper. I don't think I still do. I don't, I don't...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5268s)

You know, I think...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5269s)

That's okay.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5270s)

You don't have to. You know, it happened to you.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5273s)

I've got to be... I'm kidding myself. I'm bullshitting myself is what I say. You know, I say regularly to everyone, "Don't bullshitter a bullshitter," because I'm the greatest bullshitter that ever walked, is because..

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5287s)

 I don't think you're a bullshitter.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5288s)

I don't think you are. I'm still not myself. Do you get me? I struggle.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5295s)

You know, yep, no. And people need to understand if you're listening to this, if you have had any sort of traumatic, even if it's an exploitation at all, you know, if you've been abused, if you can understand that you don't and and really struggle to to vocalize and put it all together and compartmentalize it, it's it's, and you don't ever expect it to have to be because this happened to you. You know, this wasn't your doing. And we find it really hard, and I [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5325s) like when we've been often so misjudged and misunderstood, we often over-explain, and I feel like that most of us are trying to do that because we're trying to get some sort of validation, right?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5336s)

Yeah, that's true. That's all I wanted. I wanted to be just love. I found you are now not inside the brethren. No. No, one of the things that's really important is when they segregated us, we couldn't, we fought like cats and dogs. We were so uncomfortable as children. We were so unbearable whilst living with Joyce Dover, my step[\-grandmother,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5366s) we were unreasonable because Jean was living there, walking into the bathroom, still doing the shit she did at home and ruling the roost and thinking that she was capable, and no one was listening. I even got on the phone to try and make contact with Symington. They gave me the phone number numerous times, and it was the wrong phone number. It was deliberately to prevent me communicating with the Man of God.

[Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5396s) I say that is because there was not a level of communication that you would even be listened to. Even if I was a fabricator and the labels I've been given, why wouldn't you discover the truth? That's what I can't come to grips with, is that being a believer, I was never believed, but the truth never came out. And go back to the scripture that I quoted to you, Numbers, my [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5427s) preaching for Alan Gadsden, that's John Gadsden's father, that was simply as I said it was.

“Be sure your sins will find you out.” Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5445s)

Are you still a Christian, Mick? Are you still a believer in Christianity?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5447s)

Sorry? No, I'm not a believer at all, but I'm not an atheist. I'm not, I don't have a formed opinion. I have such indoctrination. I still am questioning everything I've ever read, heard, or believed. And I still don't know what I believe because I'm subjected to the vulnerability of not being certain about [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5477s) I might interpret what I and whether I'd be comfortable believing at all in anything.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5486s)

And and that's that's totally okay, you know.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5489s)

Personally, trust a solitary soul. I'm so, was so scared to come on here because I've never been believed.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5500s)

Well, we believe you. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we all believe you.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5506s)

Yeah. It's really hard to deal with that. Yeah. And why I want to go on with it is because then we had so much torment in the family that my brother, who's a big brute of a bloke, his his his arms are the size of my thighs, all right? He was a big, strong boy. He was looking like a huge adult at the age of 10, 12.Bbut what I'm saying is very young age, he was [built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5536s) like a brick house, and he could pick up the side of a car while I took the tire off and put it back on to change the tire. That's how strong he was, like a brute. I'm mentally strong, and not today, but in the past, I am physically strong too. There's something in our DNA that makes us brutes of people.

Oh, believe me. You know, and I want you to know that I've been in a lot of disciplinary measures where I've learned to fight for my own life. All right. And I'm talking about with police. I've got a story on that that would blow your mind. I don't want to go there. I want to focus on the abuse that came from the brethren. And that, to explain it to you, my brother picked up an antique chair and threw it at my sister.

And I'm talking about if she didn't get the door closed, she would have lost her block anyway. The best way I say to you is because of the angst and anger in our family, my sister got up and took off. She went home. Each and every one of us kids went back home and we were rejected by our parents, told to go find our own way back to where we came from. "It's your salvation. It's the place of God. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5627s) is something that you do because if you read your Bible again," as ours explained to me, "you will put God first, the assembly, and then you will forsake your parents and all that's around you for your own salvation."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5650s)

So your parents told you this? Your parents told you this as children?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5655s)

But they also did this to my sister who's still in there. They did it to each family member. And I'm going to go on to tell you more about it, because at four years of age, my brother was vulnerable like this. And I don't know whether anyone understands it, but a boy at four years of age, let alone a boy at 11 years of age or 12 at the time, 1972, remember I'm born in April. So 1972 was my first year of going to high school. And the reason why I say that to you is I went to Swinburne Tech where other brethren, Peter Bartlett, and remember the [Bartlett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5699s) name, is Brian Baker and Bartlett were B\&B meringues and all that sort of shit that the brethren were very good at providing pavlovas and all that sort of stuff and doing it commercially. And then if you look around the corner was the Parkers and the Parkers were Golden Crumpets.

All right, just so you can glimpse into the fact that Swinburne was just around the corner. Now, the reason why I say this to you is Brian Baker came to pick me up on numerous occasions, and particularly one occasion, so it verifies what I'm saying, is he took me to Central Park, which is just on the other side of the railway from the Swinburne Tech, and he raped me. And the only place I could run to was through that park, over the railway, down the hill again into the backyard of Bartlett & Baker. And when I told George Bartlett, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5767s) goes, "You know what, you're a fabricating, you just can't help yourself but lie. All you can do is lie and make people resent you, and you're just pure filth. Why don't you learn from your mistakes?"

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5785s)

How could a child make that up?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5794s)

I went back to it. I went back to that spot because my daughter said, "Dad, I want to take you there." She said, "I always thought you were crazy, old man." She goes, "You know, I thought you were crazy because you reacted to smells and you reacted to noise and certain things that happen." And she goes, "I just thought you were crazy." Now, when I got her to type out my parts of my story, she's typed out a lot of it. She goes, "Dad, I'm so sorry [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5825s) treated you like that. I'm so sorry that I didn't have the respect." 

Why I say that is because in that example, I had been picked up by this Brian Baker because my parents were not in, they were out. I'd gone to Swinburne Technical School, and I was tied up to the urinal wall and [pissed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5855s) on. And brethren saw it happen. My brother saw it happen and did nothing about it.

I was only a skinflint. I'll explain it to you why I say a skinflint. At 12 years of age, or 11 years of age, I was four foot seven, by the end of the year I was six foot three. But honestly, if you grow 16 inches in one year, do your own calc on it. If you grow 16 inches, your bones hurt like [fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5885s). I'm talking about hurt like hell, and you're as weak as sin. You can't defend yourself. You haven't the ability to defend yourself in any way because I'm just too weak.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5900s)

And you've got everything else going on.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5901s)

And everything else, but I was being raped at the same time as I was most vulnerable, in such pain, just physically, with no parent, no one to talk about it, how I was going through that suffering. And that's where I was most vulnerable, at Alf McAlpin's.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5918s)

And then when you, when you said you ran to, where did you run to? Was it a Bartlett's property or...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5926s)

Baker was their factory, because I knew there were brethren there. The only people I could go to, you don't have to do with anyone else. So you can't go into the iniquity, the sin. You can't go into a place of outsiders. Yeah, got the salvation of being a brethren. And I know that sounds crazy, but it's the way it was in my mind, whether it's fact or not. The brethren were exclusive, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5956s) we were superior, and your salvation was only to be in the assembly of God, the brethren's place, the church. And anyone that was associated was a safe place of safety. You had to accept your fellow kindred, your own people, that they were unique, that you were the one wrong because they were selective.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5983s)

Yeah, peculiar people, zealous for good works, right?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=5989s)

That's it. I don't, you know, try not to get into that because I could do that briefly. You know, I could really, yeah, I could rip you, but I really resented so much now. I want to take it on further at that point.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6001s)

Just, just before you do, you said you went into the Bartletts. Just to clarify this to me, the way he spoke to you from an out, like hearing this third person, it it sounds like it wasn't an unfamiliar story. You know, it sounds like the way he said to you, "You just fabricate things, you make things," it sounds like all the elders or the leaders or whatever you want to call them, priests, were all in the know that you were being abused.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6026s)

Yeah, all of them did that to me. I was ignored. I was treated like I was just the devil's child, and I believed it. I honestly believe I deserved to be tied up, to be felt and...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6040s)

And it's just crazy that not one of them thought to even investigate, or maybe they did, but you know, what are the cults like, right? You don't want to expose because you'd be exposing the cult.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6051s)

No, no, but but you're becoming worse by telling your story. You're becoming worse actually communicating with the world. See, there's the other side of the filth. It's not just the filth of me saying the filth, but now if I communicate with the police or that, I was just being filthy with the world. I was participating with the world. It was always described to me, 

"You are actually going out of your way to [commit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6082s) these sins against the assembly of God. The brethren are unique, and we should cherish that. We should value that, and you should do the same. And the reason why you're doing this is because you're full of hatred. You are devil-possessed."

 I have been told so many times how rocked I am. You know, the weakness of that feeling is so soul-destroying.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6108s)

Yeah, it is. I remember being told the same thing. "I had a mental problem. You're You're mental. You're mental. That's why you're saying that. You're mental. You're mental." Over and over and over.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6118s)

I'm going to give you a story about that. Really, they participated in calling the CAT team and getting me placed in a mental institution. All right. And I'm going to tell you a whole lot more. But there's a lot to say, and it really hurts to say it. But the part I'm going to is, let's go from 1972, and what my father did was he moved up to his farms because he had numerous farms. We're talking [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6148s) in excess of, on each farm, was 1,500 acres, and he had stud cattle and sheep in sheds, in pens, so they had no cross fibers, and they shear them, and therefore it was replacing cashmere. Just so you know, he was, they were penned and sheared. It’s extreme, you know, Dallas, have you ever heard of the Dallas show? I don't know whether you guys have, but [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6178s) Dallas show is with, you know, J.R. Ewing?

### **Richard Marsh**

Yeah, yeah, I've heard it.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6185s)

Comes like that. They, my father had farms where they had asphalt driveways up between the paddocks and white fences like you can't imagine, so far.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6198s)

Yeah.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6198s)

Extreme. Look, I've got photos of it. I can show all that. But my reasoning for saying this is my father was withdrawn from, he and my mother was to begin with, and then my mother came back into the brethren. So we got brought back to the church, got back to the house. And in doing that, my father then met me, when I did that, I went to Balwyn High School, where there are no brethren. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6229s) wanted nothing to do with brethren. I wasn't going to school if I didn't go to a school with no brethren.

The reason why say that is because all my grades, all through my schooling, have always said, "Michael is intelligent, quite capable, more than capable, if he'd only concentrate." Well, I want you to know why I couldn't concentrate, because of the abuse. I used to sit up in the bunk bed, afraid to lie down, afraid to go to sleep because I'd be touched and dragged out, be played with by Melva Jean Cox. And that was up to the age of roughly 10 without question, but she used to enter the bathroom regularly.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6284s)

So we're just talking about the forceful abuse. Did she physically abuse you as well, or was it mostly sexual?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6289s)

It was physical and sexual. I'm talking about, I copped hidings from her. I had my ass exposed and belted shit out. My father used to have a fiberglass rod that was thicker than my finger but went down to thinner than my pinky, and he used to belt the shit out of me with that.

But laughable, when my father moved up to the farms and was forced to sign over everything to my mother, and she was not capable of running a business nor doing anything, as all women in the brethren are. And that's where my father lost his wealth. The brethren consumed him. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6335s) given that the rivalry that was in the leadership of the brethren from the time when Alan Gadsden got withdrawn from and then Joe McMurdo took over, he was persecuted, my father, along with Bertram Murray.

All of them did what they did and came and gave priestleys. Most of the priestleys were a drinking session. Of course, my father loved to drink and then come out and rant and rave about "those bastards, the communists, the bastards." They come here and drink my drink and tell me how bad I am, yet they were happy to have my hospitality. And he'd rent and rave, right? And then he'd take it out on me. And why I say that is because my mother would be lying in the bed, not being able to come out or anything. And one day she got out and she said, "You've got to help me out of the bed. I've got to tell those men to go home." And it was early hours of the morning, they were pissed as parrots, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6397s) all they did was come to get the Chivas bottles, you know, drink flagons, I'm talking about, on ice. And my father and these people used to flick the ice with that click, you know, that tink. And yeah, it was a form of getting your attention. I know it sounds odd to the outside world, but when my father flicked that, that meant, "Do as you're told now." And why I [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6427s) that is because we grew up very disciplined. There was nothing we got away with. I was always blatantly honest with everything I did, and that caused me more grief than if I'd lied.

All right, and even to the point where brethren, I went to the Moomba, I went to football, I went all sorts of things, and brethren would deny they went with me or saw me at that. And I'd say, "Well, I saw them. What's the difference?" You know, I couldn't ever understand it. I just didn't understand what … because I couldn't give a continental. I'd go and do whatever I liked anyway. My reason for that is because it became resentful.

 Anyway, in 1972, I went to Balwyn High, and that was the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6470s) when we were told quite clearly through the ministry of JHS is no further education. It was seriously, you're not going to be educated. So I was the first of the young people that were never going to be educated. And in doing that, my father, because I went to North Horn or Bourne High, which is away from the Brethren and fairly remote, there was no [closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6501s) churches, at Belmore Road there was, but quite a way down. My father knew that he could sit out the front of the school and organize for me to get him things from home or organize for my mother come and visit, come and visit my mother, and they'd meet up in the garage of the home. But I'd leave the door open and make sure that the garage, the automatic garage door didn't open, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6531s) they'd come in, they both come in the side door, and I'd leave them to talk to each other and keep an eye up for any of the family members, including Jean Cox.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6542s)

Can I just, like for people who are not familiar with the brethren, might just be helpful to explain that when someone is withdrawn from, they're forced to separate from the other brethren. And if parents withdrawn from, the children are taken away from the parents and put with other brethren to keep them within the brethren cult. And that's what had happened to [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6572s). And what you're describing now is that your father was withdrawn from, your mother was in the Brethren, and they were breaking the rules by secretly meeting up against the Brethren's wishes, and you were kind of facilitating that to let them meet up in secret without the Brethren knowing that their wall of separation had got a hole in it. Is that the situation?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6595s)

Yes. And then just so you know, the funny thing is, when we return to our home, we were, I went out of my way to find all the belts and all the sticks and all the bamboo rods and all the fiberglass rods, and I burned them up the backyard. I burned all the thongs, I burned all the slippers, everything I could find that would do any harm to me because I knew my mother couldn't do it to me anymore because I was getting stronger and [older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6625s). Remember, I'd grown to six foot three. I was now developing into what we'd call a man. I'd learned what my body did, so I self-pleasured.

And people don't understand that, but it was a physical self-abuse, yeah, because I figured that if I did it enough, I'd bleed and no one had touched.

Then we'd go even further. My father would say to me, "Can you get me this? Can you get me that?" And then as we got older, I got familiar with, I always said no. I'll go and live with Bill Joyce. I lived with Bill and Pauline Joyce. I want you to know they were lovely people. They were people that didn't have children, but I fitted in really well. They were not liked, and Bill was [referred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6685s) to by many people as Auntie Bill, and Pauline was referred to as Uncle Pauline because she was the one that wore the pants in the family. But he was a very wealthy man, and he was a very kind, compassionate man.

In 1982, and I'm moving on fast because I don't want to bore everyone for too much, but when we moved into 1982, I got told that I'm not going to have my house, that I've got to sign up, buy the by the business from my [father](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6724s), which was Specialty Stones Landscaping, and that I was to buy the business on the books for $17,500, which was the cash I had in the bank that Jean orchestrated to be transferred to my parents, so that the separation factor happened with the brethren and my parents for the purpose of that to accommodate the position. And it was told to me that it would be all fixed when my parents got restored.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6767s)

You lost your house.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6769s)

I lost my home. I bought a shitload of debt.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6774s)

I can give you paperwork to show it. The accountant died only two years ago that was going to testify for me. He said, "Mick, you've got to tell your story because it's the sickest thing." He said, "I've never seen anyone so ill-treated." We still paid the debts up, and I still paid the debts after we were married. Now, I wanted to explain to you, when I got married, I received, before I got married, I received so many letters.

Group chats with people you didn't even have working for you. Yeah. I received letters from so many individuals saying that it was disgusting what I was doing, that I was going out into the wilderness and that for me to marry Debbie was the worst thing I could do in my life. I've got it in writing. I've got signatures telling you, from Melva Jean Cox, all sorts of people, David, sorry...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6833s)

Who did you say? From who?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6833s)

From my grandfather, Alan Kilgoure John, from Hilda Minnie John, they were my mother's parents, from David Stewart, from Eunie Stewart...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6852s)

Is this David Stewart from Sydney?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6854s)

Yes. Kellyville, Kellyville. And I've got the their signatures and everything. They think I haven't got it all, but I've been a hoarder all my life because I need one day to tell this story. I so many times attempt suicide that I now know I wasn't going to be successful because I need to do this to set others free.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6879s)

Thank you. You will.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6880s)

And it's important, important to tell you this because in the exercise of the 1982, my father, sorry, 1972, my father had to transfer everything into my mother's name, and he took the farms, which was a huge expense, you know, flamboyant farms. But my purpose of telling you that was Mark Nipper is Lance Nipper's son, [who's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6910s) the trustee of the local Boronia church. Mark Nipper orchestrated all those changes of names and ownerships of, for example, the building that was supposed to be for four boys.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6925s)

They stole it.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6926s)

Seven-storey building in the heart of Melbourne that should have been for four boys.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6934s)

But it was signed over out of our name. 

I've made mention to you before about the power of attorney and the jury power of attorney, the administration and all that. Brethren had that over me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6947s)

So not only they stole your innocence, they stole your inheritance.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6951s)

Yep. And my own home.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6954s)

They raped you. They beat you. They stole shit from you. Yep.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=6961s)

And I got crucified and shut up so many times for working on Saturdays and Sundays because I just wanted to get away from them. I was going to make sure that I had enough gathered, that's the 17,500. And I'll give you the paperwork. I'll show you 100% that the brethren made me sign under duress of on a Sunday of Alf McAlpin, Brian Baker, Bill Joyce, Rob Sangster to preserve the brethren that were engaged in that business that wasn't mine. I want you to know they spent money and I paid off these debts that I never was a signatory to my own accounts.

I didn't use that alone to walk out with nothing, taking on such debts that I brought with me, thinking I'd paid them off when I got married. I got a group certificate and got a group tax to pay the people I didn't employ.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7037s)

And they were brethren and outsiders that manipulated so that I had nothing. And when I got married to Debbie, we bought our first home. When I first wanted to buy my home, what happened was Debbie lent my parents 6,100. I've got proof and records of it, of which my parents deliberately took to manipulate me so that I couldn't support or be with her.

There's a really sinister part of that because Debbie thought that she was doing the right thing, investing with wealthy people that think... Why Debbie went and had to do with my parents is she never understood, and she can speak for herself anytime, but she never understood why I never had to do with my family. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't let her take my kids near my family.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7099s)

Yeah.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7099s)

She couldn't understand why if I was such a good person, so genuine, how could he come out of a family and not absolutely have to do with anyone?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7114s)

Because you're not like them, right? You're not, you can't hurt other people. You don't want to turn your pain into other people's pain, right? And so many people that have been abused, I shouldn't say so many, but some do, right? They they're hurt and they hurt other people. And you're not, you stopped that. You took something so evil and and have still come out a loving, compassionate person. It's it's mind-blowing.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7143s)

And the thing is that I've lost everything, but my whole goal in life is to never, I don't want anything in my name. I have nothing. I'm penniless. I don't want money. I actually resent it. It's the root of all evil.

And I've made my life through purely wanting to work and live with Debbie.

Worked huge hours, between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. in the morning till 11:00 o'clock at night in her business so that no one could take any more from me.

Everything's in her name for that reason. Do you know how humiliating that is when you truly know what your worth is? You know that you can earn bucket loads of money, and I'm talking about more than most people because I've got that tenacity, that incredible go-go that you know, born from the persecution, I became a very resilient man, very strong, very fit.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7211s)

I was going to say, most of us can attest to that. You know, we've all, we've been put through, you do come out very resilient, if anything.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7220s)

You can't hurt me. You can, you could cut my feet, I could cut my finger off in front of you with a pair of secateurs and not flinch. Why? Because I've been hurt more than you. The pain is inside. You can't see that. I know I cry, but you can't see the…and everyone thinks that. So I want to move on because what happened was I got angry and challenged, took my family to court to get Debbie's money back. And we bought this home, and we had no deposit because they tricked her into handing over the money, and she was pregnant.

So we moved in, finally got, we worked night and day and we got this house and we got the deposit back. We borrowed the maximum amount, 95% of our home. We paid a further… the home I wanted to get was in Port Mel, sorry, Albert Park, Albert Park. And I wanted to buy it at the time. We could have bought it for $64,000. And Debbie goes, "No, I don't want to [buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7299s) a house there. It's too, it's haunted." But it was an old-fashioned home. Today, you couldn't buy one for the love of money. But my reasoning for saying it is because that's how I grew up in these flamboyant homes. And I knew that we could make money. But given that Debbie didn't come from that flamboyancy, I just wanted to please her. I would have done anything to just be with her.

I have lived my life to be with the love of my life, to have [honesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7330s), trust, know that I don't need to be in control. There's a controller there that I can trust. Given the controller that I grew up under was out of control and destroyed them in every way possible. We're talking about taking the deposit for our home, stripping us of every single solitary thing. 

And I want to go back to where my parents went haywire was when they sold the, they had to [sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7360s) the building because “Greys is Great” is a cigar or cigarette factory originally. And my grandfather bought it. And on that, on the wall of that building, which you can still see from the street in the center of Melbourne, Elizabeth Street, you can look up “Greys is Great” and it's a cigar or cigarette company, and it was to promote them. 

And having said that, that was one of the stipulations [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7390s) my father had to get rid of his farms to come back. He had to get rid of his farms, sell the building, get rid of his business. Originally, he was typesetting and printing and offered, he was going computerized, and they wanted him to get rid of his computers. Get rid of his two-way radios in his cars because he had more cars flying around picking up all the proofreading that he, you know, for all the advertising from the Myers and all the big wig companies. He did all the typesetting and printing for them. And why I'm saying it is the brethren walked out on my family on the Tuesday night. So let's call it a hundred people guaranteed, but maybe more, [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7440s) possibly up to 200, maybe more too. But for the sake of knowing that I can, I can definitely tell you 100 brethren walked out overnight when my father was withdrawn from them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7453s)

So you mean these are employees who walked out of your father's business just because they had been withdrawn?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7461s)

Their homes were paid off, their long service leave, their holiday pays, everything were paid out of the Dover account. But to understand that, you need to know the structure that Mark Nipper and other brethren, Ernie Elphick and, we I can go into all the names that had a huge influence into the accounting part of the business.

They crippled my father deliberately.

And they did that to other businesses like Robinhood or Rangehood. They did it to the likes of Draffin. Draffin is Monodeck and Rangehood and and Robinhood, overhead, over your hot plates, over your stove to take out the steam and do you get me? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So what I'm saying is they destroyed a whole lot of people, Milton Needham's business it was, and they handed it over to Brethren. And why I'm saying this to you is there isn't anyone that doesn't know the stories, they just won't tell the stories. And why it is, is because they're now carrying it out to the nth degree in the commercialism, and that the Hales have got into everyone's [wills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7554s), into everyone's businesses, and if you leave, you lose the lot. Well, I lost a lot not signing. *They* signed\! Do you get it? 

**Richard Marsh**

They signed in your name? 

**Mick Dover**

They signed, because the power of attorney and the enduring power of attorney, and they forged my signature to cover it up. They sold the Dover building to the state government just to get rid of the building because it had “Greys is Great” written over it.

And inside that building was computers, in-house computers, not computers we're talking about today. And today they have fucking mobile phones, they have the internet that I will not learn purely [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7596s) I'm angry that everything that happened in my life, that I was more than capable and so much smarter than most of them, if not all of them, that I could have operated this damn internet and all this shit. And my father was so angry that I walked away with not being part of that business that was huge. We're talking about printing all the newspapers throughout Australia.

### 

The Herald, the Sun, the Truth, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Argus, I proofread all, a lot of those things. The Reader's Digest, the Penguin books, you know, I don't know whether you understand, but they were huge. Yeah, they were massive. Massive.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7642s)

Yeah. In the UK, Penguin Books are huge. Yeah, they're best-known publisher.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7646s)

Yeah. My father tried to assist the brethren using the computer to print the ministry. The minute Taylor or Symington spoke the words of the Man of God, the Dovers were equal to print it and typeset it and bind it and send it out to the world within 24 hours.

Financially crippled them. The Murdochs and the Packers, far richer than the Packers and the Murdochs. But they were manipulated and the brethren, meaning the Nippers and you name all the highfalutin arseholes. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7690s)

Name them. Like, don't be afraid to name them because it's very...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7692s)

I'd actually like to do that, but I'd like to actually go out of my way to give you papers to show the signatures so that there's not a question. And I don't want the questions to not be answered. This is why I said a Q\&A.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7710s)

We can do a part two.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7711s)

Yeah, definitely. I don't want to make this too long. But my purpose of saying it to you is in 1982, October 1982, I left the Brethren. And I went to Bill Joyce and I said, "Bill, I don't agree with my parents being withdrawn from. I resent that none of you will do anything about the abuse I've been through. I've lost my home. You're all doing what you want to do. But nothing's right, just, or fair. And it's against the law. You're discriminatory. You're abusive. You're defamatory."

And Bill said to me, "You know, Mick, I know what's been done, but I can't help you." I said, "Well, thanks, Bill. I'm so grateful for everything you and Pauline have ever done for me."

He goes, "You know something? You would be the ideal son."

And I said to him, "No, I wouldn't, because Brian Baker said that. I just want you, I would like you to be my son."

What people don't know is the coercion for them to fuck my life was over lollies, meringues. Do you, does anyone understand that they use these things as a simpleton, as a young brainwashed cult member that didn't, and that that was not normal till later on in life? And then when I confronted everyone because I was made to be the devil, that when I did finally get the balls and grow up, I go, "I'm not doing this anymore. I got to get away from you all." And I left.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7818s)

For your own safety.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7820s)

And ever since, I've been confronted with brethren, numerous brethren. They go, "Why? Why don't you come back?" And then they infiltrated our lives by coming in when my father went back in 2008\. In 2009, the Brethren came into our own home, into Debbie's own, I should say, because it's not my home. They came into our home, they sized us up. Debbie even said to them, "Why are you sizing us up?"

And David Stewart said, "We're not." Debbie says, "You don't have to. I can see what you're doing."

And the reason why I'm saying this to you is that in 2009, I broke down because my father had gone back in after telling me that he would never go back in.

He'd bonked Jean and he'd bonked Jocelyn John in my own... Now, I want to tell you something no one wants to tell the stories in my own home.

### 

And I haven't bonked any other woman than Debbie. So who the fuck do you all think you are, is how I feel. Do you get me? I didn't do anything wrong in my life. I loved you. I cared for you. I used to pick up people in wheelchairs and put them in their seats in the church. I used to make sure people were parked correctly so that the disabled could get there. I would do anything to assist. And I loved the brethren so, so much. And now I'm an opposer because I'm speaking out again. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7927s) I've spent 40 years trying to cut it off.

And I haven't been successful to the point where Debbie had a situation where she had got a brain injury. She fell down a drain. Her vehicle ran out of fuel. And when I rocked up there, it really affected me seeing her lying on the road because I know that I'd lied on the road once. I’d been beaten the shit out of my father, and Brethren knew about that. I was caned [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=7961s) bad I couldn't walk. 

And what I'm saying to you is it affected me dramatically because Debbie was harmed, the love of my life, and it just brought back all the shit that happened. I didn't get over it in a hurry, real well. And given that we're in a position where we should have been able to retire, I was now going to have to help my wife. She's lost her taste, her smell, she's lost most of……organs of her body. She's profoundly deaf in the right ear, 79% lost in the left ear.

She's totally a changed person who has been disabled to such an extent that even Molly Meldrum, she was in Epworth with him. I want you to know when in 2012 I went into Epworth with Debbie because I finally got her help. I spent nine years fighting the courts to prove that Debbie was not drunk, that she was ill-treated by the Maroondah  Hospital and that the blood wasn't taken from her, that she was not drunk. She actually was brain injured. My wife lost so much weight that she went down by, we're talking about phenomenal amount of kilos, and I don't want to over-exaggerate it, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8054s) from the point of being 40 kilos less now, all right? And I picked up and I bathed her. I've been caring for ever since.

My whole point is a lonely man with no one against the dam, and they walk into our home in 2009 and tell us, "You can come back in. We'll give you a home. We'll make sure you never have to work again."

And the sick part about it is my father went back in there after being a filthy person, in my opinion. But my whole subject to tell you is that Debbie was at her most vulnerable. She would never have joined the Brethren if she was thinking straight. But I had to convince her not to go near them, stay away.

Even her, she was fascinated by how they were. They actually were appealing.

### 

They entered our home, and I'll tell you the people's names. Richard Garrett, David Stewart, Jeff Fish, Doug Burgess, all came into our home to try and coerce us to go back in. They organized to go to the church for Debbie. They even organized a dress. She has never worn a dress other than the wedding in her life.

The audacity. All right. And they said that she could come in, that she was God's sister. This is how convincing they were, while she was a brain-injured woman. Now, why I'm saying it to you is my father went back in after telling our kids, and he'd not met them, so much so that he said to them, "He'll never go back in. They were communists. They were worse than communism." But he went back in because he was broke, and he went back in with Jean Cox.

And Bruce, John, the Hales, apologized to him.Can you see my analogy, how sick it is to apologize to a perpetrator?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8184s)

Wait, so your dad went back into the PBCC with your abuser?

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8190s)

Yes. And then, and Jocelyn and Graham John went in as well at that same time. So you got, I broke down anyway.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8198s)

I remember hearing about this because I'm, I'm like Sydney, so I remember. But again, they all went back because they were lonely and didn't have money, and that that's...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8207s)

Now, I wanted you to know something. Jean Cox bonked my father for all those years after my mother died. She died in 1987, wasn't it? '88.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8221s)

My mother wanted to take her life, and she did take her life. She wanted to take it on the 25th of December, and it was like a remembrance day that you can never forget. Instead of Christmas, it was, "Your mother died."

I'm telling you, the manipulation of brethren thinking, it's sick. Yeah, it's so ingrained. "I'll forgive you." You tell me, "I forgive him." You have no idea how sick that is.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8257s)

Yeah.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8258s)

Jean put on my mother's rings, and my family was so distraught over that. They saw her with these big diamonds. We're talking about not half carats, maybe two carats, you know, big. We're talking about expensive. Not that it means anything to me, but I'm just explaining it so that people understand that she would wear all these things and think... Now, I'm going to explain to you, [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8288s) also, when she, before she went back into the brethren, she took all the Rena-Ware, I don't know whether you know what Rena-Ware is, but it's cookware. She took that out of the house, removed it after it was given to Debbie.

She removed it out of the house and took it to her family, the Cox's. By the way, John, John, whatever his name is, I can't think of the name, starts with it, is a copper, Fooks, and John Fooks is a copper, and he received stolen goods. Do you get me? And the brethren have used the cops to penalize me, to lock me up, to treat me like, like you can't imagine.

Why I'm saying it to you is they had so much power, they can influence even the governing bodies. And I'm going to say to you, in 2009, I went to the Royal Commission and I got rejected because they're not a recognized group. And they're not a recognized religion.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8349s)

And I got rejected, and I was really hurt with that because I want to tell my story because no one understands what the cult does to a person. They remove any validity of your own person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8368s)

Yeah.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8369s)

We all hear you on that. And I want you to know, after losing what's material doesn't mean much to me. I can let that go, but the person has been hurt.

The indoctrination, the brainwashing, the effect that it's had on my life from here on has been seriously sick and has affected me. I want to explain to you this why, is because I tell you this story, is because in 2009, I broke down and my son said, "Dad, what's the matter with you?"

I said, "Well, why don't you ring my father?" He rang my father, and my father contacted brethren, within the brethren because he was living with my sister, and they said, "Call the doctor." They called the CAT team.

They called the cops anyway. They they convinced Debbie this. Remember, she's a brain-injured woman too. Severely brain injured.

But they got the CAT team in. They came in with capsicum. They got police. Police. They took me out in a Dippy van. They put me into the Maroondah Hospital. They put injections in and told me that I'll never remember my past. They'll obliterate my mind.

Who did this? The Maroondah Hospital, and the brethren condoned it, were behind all of it. So you can see why I can't forgive. You can see how angry I am. And this, for all this story has to come out because it's, it's just sickening.

### 

The effect that it's had on me and it's had on my family. The way I say it is because I don't know where to stop and start with all the stories. I can tell you so many, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, thousands of stories about the effects and the sexual abuse, the financial abuse, the spiritual abuse, the physical abuse, all condoned by “protecting the position.” And I'm not taking it anymore. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8506s) why I'm out. I'm going to tell the truth. I don't care how long it takes all of you to listen. Someone's going to have it on record so we can expose this sick regime.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8517s)

Thank you.I think that's perfect. I think that's perfect. We, I think we should do a part two because there's so much, so much more that we want to talk to you about. It’s sick, and I'm one of the people that doesn't think the church can be fixed. I think it needs to be taken apart.

But your story is is heartbreaking, but thank you so much for sharing this because this is going to stir people into action and doing their own reports and and coming forward. And the more that this is recorded and documented, now this is going to be forever, right? This isn't getting deleted.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8564s)

Yeah, they're open-air preaching. They used to prevent me from walking across the crossing in Boronia and say to me, "The Lord is there for you to throw your feet at the Lord, at the Lord Jesus. Throw yourself at the feet of the Lord Jesus and ask for forgiveness, Mick." And that was Ron Garrett and Alan Grace.

And I'm telling you, they used to do that and ostracize me, prevent me from crossing the crossing, stand [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8594s) my way and say, "Why don't you come back in? We need you." And I'd go, "You don't need me. You don't even like me. None of you believe me, and I'm no longer a believer."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8608s)

Well, we believe you, and we really appreciate you sharing this story. And I definitely think we should do a part two. I do want...

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8615s)

But I want you to ask a lot of questions. I want to give you proof. I want to show you things that you'll have questions about. I want anyone, in or out. I'm talking about ex-Brethren, in-Brethren. I don't care who sees this. I want them to ask a question and I will do my best to answer it. Yeah, maybe you can come back with a list.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8638s)

That's perfect. So let me say that to the listeners right now. After part one comes out here, please send in your questions to the email address info.getalife@proton.me, and we will screen those questions, of course, and try and get them ready for the next time we do a podcast here. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8660s)

If you are listening, you're listening to this, and this is familiar, because obviously, unfortunately, most of us know with perpetrators there is not just one victim. So if there is, please, please, you know, you can remain anonymous, and we can therefore help bring clarity and justice for victims like Mick.

And I know there is because I've spoken with a couple of people who are a similar age to you, Mick, that have reached out since I started [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8690s) TikToks, mainly women, that were subjected to a very similar thing with a group of men and probably women in the similar area. So it's very, very... I just thank you. I can't thank you enough for standing up. You are so brave and you are a chain breaker.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8713s)

And I'm proud of it. I'm ashamed of where I came from.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8720s)

You should be. We can't. Yeah. Unfortunately, we can't do much about where we came from, but what we're doing, what we can change is the future, and that's what you're doing. So thank you.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8732s)

Yeah, well, I just want people that are out there that need somewhere to communicate with, to know that I'm here. Because I understand most things that have ever happened to anyone. You know, 429 people have been through our home. Wow. Well, we've got stories to tell.

I've got a young man who came to us at 17\. He left, he turned 50 the other day, December the 11th. Do you know I had to show him how to shower? He was abused. And I told Debbie what questions to ask because an abuser knows how to ask the questions, because only the abuser knows what happened.

And that's what I'm asking. Just come and talk to me. I am the most peaceful person. I only want peace and I want to share your personal journey so that I can show you absolute respect, not judge you. The thing I resent most of the Brethren [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8803s) the judgment they make of one another. And I just want you, anyone that's listening, that I am here with one purpose: not to judge, to help.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8821s)

And create that safe landing pad for other victims. You know, but I've got people in my life that have helped leave the cult over the last seven years who are too afraid at this point to speak up about what has happened to them. I'm sure it will come, but it's people like yourself, Mick, that are coming forward and telling a story, and like Cheryl, that are really creating that safe landing pad for other victims to come forward and put an end to this abuse, this [generational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8852s) cult that abuses and hides abusers, that harbors abusers, that will not acknowledge their part in it.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8861s)

No, that's right. And you know, all of you that have come on here, I've never spoken to you before. I've never met you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8868s)

No.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8870s)

I don't know you, but thank you. Thank you for listening. I know I'm long-winded, I know I'm hurting. Thank you for sharing. I know I'm a miserable bastard, but I don't mean to be. I just want you to know, they can hate the bastards as much as they like. I love the bastards. I love anyone that's naughty because a naughty boy becomes a bloody good man, and I reckon I'm a good person.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8901s)

I [fucking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8900s) love that. That's a great way to end it. That is perfect. Richard, any...?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8905s)

Mick, you're an inspiration. It's heart-rending to listen to you, but it's an inspiration, too, that what you've overcome and become someone who's actually a refuge for people who've been abused. And you know, what you're doing today, I was just thinking it's almost like today is the answer to that word you gave about 'be sure your sins will [find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8935s) you out,' because today's the day when their sins *will* find them out.

### [**Mick Dover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8942s)

Yeah, that's why it's because it's so emphatic with me. It's one of the memories that a lot of Brethren, especially the older ones, know and know the charisma I had, the vivacious expression, because I was always very well versed and focused, and I still am today. The only problem is the pain overwhelms me and I thought I could bury it. You cannot. You [must](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8972s) not. You must feel the way to life that you've been given is worth living. I know the most important part of learning about life is to actually live it, not under a rule of someone.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPL46VDFELc&t=8991s)

Excellent. Well said. Goodbye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening, and until the next time.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
