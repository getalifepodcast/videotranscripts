## Summary

It was just another day at the office, but as Murray Chattell arrived, he burst into a torrent of tears. A sympathetic work colleague covered for him at work as she insisted that he went to see a Doctor.
As Murray shares what led up to that final breakdown and how this resulted in him leaving the brethren, we see yet another family divided by the brethren doctrine of separation. Murray describes how he tried to continue to see his children, and up to a point was successful in doing so – until recently.
Murray gives some excellent advice on how to protect your mental well being when leaving the PBCC by finding like minded friends as you navigate the transition into non PBCC life.

### [**Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=17s)

Hello everybody and welcome to the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We're here today with my friends Ross and Gilli and Anne, and we're joined by our very special guest, Murray Chattell. Murray, like us, is an ex-member of the PBCC and we'll perhaps start at the very beginning Murray and you could tell us when you left and what led up to you leaving the PBCC.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=42s)

Hi, well yeah, thanks for having me on. When did I leave? It's a bit of a, I guess technically I left in 2017 but in reality, I didn't officially leave probably till the end of 2019\. Was that right? 2019? 2018? They all flow into one another. But yeah, I was born into the PBCC, as were my parents.

Brought up as one of nine children in Northampton. Growing up was a challenge for me and I guess really my journey towards leaving started when I was eight or nine actually. As a child, I don't know, you would, Ross certainly knows a few people in Northampton and Anne and Gilli would know a few of the characters and the families or whatever.

But my [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=106s), we weren't at the top of the tree as far as the hierarchy went. My dad, lovely guy, wouldn't do anyone a mean trick. He was a little bit unusual and he didn't necessarily fit the mold, which actually now I'm quite proud of him for. At the time though, as a child, I used to get picked on and bullied a bit and it was like because my dad was a bit [unusual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=136s).

I remember, I think I was probably 10 at the time, nine or 10, and I was literally sick to the back teeth of being bullied. I'd had enough of it and I thought, fuck it, if you can't beat them, join them. So I consciously made a decision to rebel against my parents, which I guess kind of set me up for the rest of my [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=166s), because in doing that, in my attempt to fit in, I kicked against the status quo. You know, if somebody said no, I said why, and if they couldn't give me a good reason, I stuck my nose in it and found out why.

And that was my, I feel like that was my, all through life, that's probably been, whether it's a challenge or a good thing, I think it's a good thing on hindsight, but it did get me into a lot of trouble.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=202s)

So when you say your dad was different and didn't fit the mold, I mean, I've been ex-members, we all understand what the mold is because we've all come from that background. But perhaps explain to our listeners what that would have meant practically. Was he his own person? Was he a free spirit or in what way?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=221s)

Essentially, he was his own person, and I think the biggest, probably the biggest thing was he wasn't very vocal. So my dad's a very, very intelligent person. Socially, he's not very interactive in the sense if he's got nothing to say, he won't make an effort to say anything. Whereas the norm within the brethren is, you know, it's all about social interaction and, you know, entertaining is a formality really and people coming into your home and you host [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=263s) and you entertain them and you give them a good time.

On hindsight, I honestly don't think anybody ever left my dad's house undernourished or mistreated. I really, if so, I would challenge someone to come and point out a time when they did. But you know, my dad would, there's nothing to say, he's not going to make conversation for the sake of it.

His father actually put up a lot of money to build the Northampton City church back in 1979\. And my dad, he grew up very privileged. He had a lot of spare time on his hands, he didn't really have to work at that time and he was very, very involved in the construction of the church and he kind of treated it like his project.

And if any of my peers, I was very young, I was born in 1980, so [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=331s) '79 was when the church was built, so I was a child, you know, we'd get into trouble for running around on the seats after the meeting and playing with the microphones. And my dad wouldn't hesitate to tell me off or anyone else he saw playing with the microphones, but he then became among my peers, he became labeled the policeman. You know, whereas, yeah, you know, my friends' dads all appeared to be a little bit more chilled out and a bit more [socially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=361s) interactive.

And I genuinely, I love my dad to bits and love my mum to bits and part of my, I'm gonna say anger, because I think that's what it is, that I don't harbor it, but I do have, is that my dad was very much misused, mistreated. He's very intelligent, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=393s) will do anything for anybody and people would take advantage of that. But he was still, in a lot of people's opinion, a substandard Plymouth brother because he didn't take part in the meetings. You know, he was very awkward when he was asked to preach or say something. He was very awkward and, you know, and therefore he wasn't normal. Whatever normal is, apart from a setting on a machine.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=421s)

Exactly. He wasn't brethren normal.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=423s)

He wasn't brethren normal. Yes. And he would, but they were quite happy to use him, you know, when they wanted him, when they had a technical problem or something that they couldn't, you know, he struggled in business. He had, so he had property, he inherited property from my grandfather and that was his income. And I think it was, I'm going to suggest it was round about the late [1980s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=454s), I think it was Jim Symington said that you wouldn't want to, I stand to be corrected on that, but he said you wouldn't want to, you wouldn't rent property to worldly people, non-brethren, because you don't know what they're doing, you know what they might be doing in your property.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=468s)

Yeah, that's correct.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=469s)

Yeah, it was. So my dad, bless him, in his naivety, he sold all his properties.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=482s)

Residential properties that he had?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=483s)

Yeah, I think there was, yeah, there were residential and there was a couple of commercial ones, I think. Bear in mind, I was only nine or ten at the time, I was very, you know, and let's put it this way, if I'd been 18 or 20, he would not have sold those as easily.

But he was very much, you know, wouldn't harm anybody, this was the right thing to do, the Man of God has spoken, this is, I'll do what I'm told without any foresight or thinking. Like [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=520s) went on blind faith, you know, without thinking, well, hang on, I'm killing the goose that lays the golden egg, this is what I live off. This is what feeds my family, this is how we survive.

And then of course, and bless him, he attempted to set up a business and failed and he then got swallowed up by another local family business commercially and he was always very much looked down upon for failing in business. That was a, you know, that was a shameful thing [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=558s) do and it just added to his abnormality, if you like, as far as the brethren were concerned.

So I found this again, but then this also fed into my fight against, between being rejected and accepted. I've always had this desire to be accepted and I'm an all or nothing person. You know, I often talk about, we go to, we used to go to the street preaching and I used to hate it, absolutely hate standing on the street.

But I thought, well, if I'm going to go to all that [effort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=598s) and overcome all that fear to actually step out there and make a dick of myself and shout down some street in Northampton, I might as well do it properly. You know, I didn't see, I didn't see the point in going and mumbling, so I would go all out and give it beans, you know.

And I remember once, one guy walked up to me when I was preaching and he was all dressed in leathers, like a biker guy, Hells Angels type guy. He walked right up to me and I thought, in my head, I was thinking, I'm in trouble here. For some reason, I just kept talking, I literally kept to the point. He was like right in front of my face and he just held his hand out, he goes, "Mate," he said, "I admire your courage." I was like...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=651s)

You were expecting a punch in the face.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=659s)

Yeah, but I kind of resented the way that my dad was treated and to a degree still is, the way he was disrespected. My mum, bless her, she's a lovely person. I'm one of nine, our house was quite chaotic. You know, I could iron my own shirts at the age of nine or ten because if they're washed, just be thankful, if you want it ironed, do it yourself.

Yeah, and again, she was probably looked down upon for that. She was definitely despised because she didn't, you know, we didn't have an amazingly immaculate house 24/7. We didn't live in a show home, we lived in a home that had nine children in it. And to be fair, my parents, they did their best. They did their best.

I mean, I've learned, I've learned a lot since having spoken to professionals, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=723s) know, trying to understand myself as a person. Yeah, even just being one of nine children has an effect on you emotionally, mentally, physically. You know, actually for 14 months of my life, I was the apple of my parents' eye, I was the focus in the household, I was the baby. You know, my sister was born 14 months later, I was born 14 months later, my younger brother was born.

Right up until the age of, I remember when my youngest sister, I remember my parents telling me that, you know, I'm expecting another baby and all I thought was, by the time she's my age, I will be 40\. And I walked out of the house and went to the pub and got absolutely hammered. But that was, but that in itself was, but even that was a naivety. It was like, well, there's no contraception, there's no, you know, we'll breed like rabbits, children are God-given, if God gives us one, he gives us one, if he gives us 10, he gives us 10\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=799s)

Yeah, yeah, I can remember that very much being the ethos in the 70s and 80s. It was a case of, yeah, the more children you have, the better, God's blessing you almost, never mind whether the poor mother could actually cope with more children.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=818s)

I mean, it's no wonder, okay, my mum, bless her, she didn't drink alcohol, she doesn't drink tea and coffee and she doesn't drink alcohol, so she's quite amazing for a brethren person. But it's no wonder people turn, within there, they do turn to alcohol, they do turn to, you know, they do, they've probably got [PTSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=848s).

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=848s)

Yeah, it's a coping mechanism, isn't it? You know, if you've got more to do than you know how to cope with and you don't know how to cope, it's the coping mechanism. And it's readily available and encouraged in the brethren.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=863s)

Exactly. And I find that I think everybody in there has to have a secret life they're coping with of some sort. Whether it's wrong, as far as brethren are concerned, or whether it's them just struggling with natural thoughts and natural human propensities. There's a word.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=887s)

I haven't heard for a while. And for our non-listeners, that's a very brethren phrase, judging your propensities.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=899s)

Fleshly propensity, that's it, 

**Anne**

fleshly, that's it, yes, yes.

**Murray Chattell**

How often did you hear about those, Anne, on a Tuesday night? 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=910s)

Sorry Murray, carry on.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=912s)

But so yeah, so fast forward, I guess I spent all my teenage years, I was trying to prove something all my life. I was trying to prove something. And another significant fact was, so I went to mainstream school until I was 14\. So I did, we had lower, middle and upper in Northampton at that time. And I did lower school, middle school and then you went to upper school at, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=942s) think 14 was the first year. And I did one year at NSB, which is Northampton School for Boys, which is a good school, it's a recognized school.

And it's an interesting fact that I was never top of the class, but I always got my homework done on time and I always got reasonable grades. Again, I think it was part of me not wanting to be a failure, not wanting to fit in. So I had a teacher, I had peers at school that I was, you know, performing against, if you like, I had teachers that had expectations. So I delivered my work on time. And then it eventually [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=988s) back from John Hales, from Australia, that we should have our own schools.

And so very naively, it was done differently in different countries. It was handled differently. But I know in the UK, we basically went on to this correspondence course, Carmarthen.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1012s)

Yeah, I did a couple of correspondence courses through them.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1017s)

Yeah, and so bear in mind technology, I was at school, I was doing really well in design technology, that was where my, if I've got a talent, that's where it would lie. And I was doing really well and but also, bear in mind, I wasn't allowed to use computers. So I was doing all the work that the other kids were doing on computers, I was doing it by hand.

And anyway, my parents pulled me out, again, just without thinking about anything, the consequences or any, because they pulled me out of mainstream school, which, they then received a very, very snotty letter from the head of design technology at NSB saying it was a real shame and shocking that you'd take Murray away, a very promising student for the school.

And potentially, I mean, obviously he was looking at, he wants some good grades and then potentially I was one of his better options, his chances of a decent GCSE and an A-level grade, didn't they?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1085s)

But it was also potentially your future. If it was a subject that you liked and you were good at, that's potentially a route you could have followed for a work career, exactly, potentially. So I agree, teachers want pupils that make them look good, I teach myself, and so that's your future as well that he may have been thinking, what's happening here?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1107s)

And I was probably in one of the best schools in Northampton to achieve that, short of going to a private institution. It was a Grant-maintained school at that time, so it wasn't... I mean, it's still now a very recognised institution. So I was taken from that environment to an environment where I think I had history, geography, maths, English and physics.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1137s)

And you were how old at this point?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1140s)

I was 14\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1141s)

14, 15\. You would have been what is now the first year of O-levels or GCSEs.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1148s)

Yes, yes, final two years of secondary school, correct. Yeah, so I did the first year of upper school, which was your, you know, you decide what subjects you want to do for, yes, yeah. Just as I went, yeah, that's right, you've got it, a year nine. And just as I was about to go and do my GCSEs, I was pulled out.

And I had these, I remember it, they're five white ring binders with a ream of paper in each one, black and white wording, piss boring. I had a little desk set up in the spare room looking out over the garden and I was meant to go in there at nine o'clock and go in there and shut the door and I didn't come out until midday. And I was meant to wade through these things. My mum, bless her, she had too much to do, she couldn't even, she hadn't got a hope of helping us, you know, she tried, she did her best. And I lost interest, I was bored.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1214s)

Yeah, I don't think any 14-year-old lad in no circumstances is not going to. But what were the reasons at the time put out by, it was John Hales, wasn't it, that said about the schooling? What was the reason given for taking children out of mainstream school? And I understand it was a secondary age at that point, wasn't it?

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1236s)

Yes, yeah. Well, we were told to take all of our children out of school, because it would have been the same year, you're talking about '94. Correct, yeah, yeah. Well, in Coventry, a certain person stood up and told us to take our children out of school and we were one of the obedient ones and we took Clinton and Scott out of school. They were in, Clint was just going into what would be year three and Scott was in reception, whatever, yeah, year one. Yeah, and we took them.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1286s)

It's worth noting because it did come out later, I think you'll find in Australia they didn't do the correspondence thing. In Australia, there was a whole plan set out. So John Hales's plan, I think I'm right in saying, was quite, it was a complete plan and they went straight into proper schools or at least proper learning environments.

Whereas in the UK, there was a document that was [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1316s) to the UK, but there was a hierarchy within the UK that didn't accept it or didn't like John Hales and basically they made a dog's dinner of it. And yeah, we ended up doing correspondence. I don't think it was ever the design or intention that we did correspondence. 

**Anne**

We were told the same person stood up two weeks later in Coventry and told us that by taking our children out of school, we [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1346s) gone ahead of the Lord. My understanding, I actually went, I insisted on a conversation with that person. And me and my ex had a meeting with him. Had he forgotten he'd said this that two weeks before? Oh, well, he does forget things, doesn't he? Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1366s)

They do. But my understanding too was in Australia, and they still are, they're in a position where their schools are, their schools are much more state-funded than our schools here in the UK. And what I, from talking to other people, I kind of got the impression they were doing it in Australia, so we kind of had to do it in us here in the UK, but the whole system of funding was so different.

They didn't know quite how to execute it. Would that sort of be a fair...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1393s)

Yeah, but this is the problem where you've got, I'm going to say, for an analogy perspective, I'm going to suggest you've got a dictator and puppets. Right, the dictator's got the plan, he's got the big picture, the puppets don't think for themselves and they have to take the initiative, but they don't want to step on the dictator's toes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1424s)

Yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1424s)

So what you end up with is people running around trying to do the right thing, misinterpreting it, oh shit, we got that wrong, backtracking, we should be doing this, and you just end up with this chaotic mess, which is effectively what we ended up with in the UK.

Even, you see, I think in Australia, they get the funding for the schools. They were very ruthless and I'm going to suggest smart in the approach. They went straight in there, convinced the authorities that they were a good entity and worth investing in. Yeah, whereas in the UK, we basically told them that we were a duff bunch of idiots before we'd even asked them for money. You know, [does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1477s) that make...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1477s)

Yeah, it does. But the UK, I mean, we won't get into the intricacies of schooling funding, but they don't have the same taxpayer system of funding independent schools or straight anyway. So yeah, so that was a double whammy for the brethren, wasn't it? They'd not done themselves any favors and then, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1494s)

And then, yeah, then the system didn't support it anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1498s)

The system didn't support it anyway. So, but that actually would have affected a lot of children's, teenagers', 10 to 16-year-olds' education, wouldn't it? A lot within the brethren, almost every child in that age group at that point in the mid-90s would have had their education interrupted, wouldn't they?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1513s)

Yeah, and the ones that, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, there were local, you know, in Northampton, there was a couple of families where, you know, the wives really took an interest in and stepped up to basically become teachers. Yes, and they did, you can't be a teacher as a mum, no, no, it doesn't work.

And to be fair, I'm not going to mention the name, but the sister in Northampton that did it, her family were all, well, she had one [child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1544s) my age, younger than me, the rest were all working and, you know, so she was kind of, had spare time. Whereas my mum, bless her, she had like nine children at home, she hadn't got a hope.

And yeah, and I'm not here to knock that whole process, but it is worth pointing out that there is a generation, if you like, of personnel within the brethren, if they got any grades, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1575s) it was because either they were, they had exceptional parents, you know, I'm gonna say supersonic parents, or they're exceptionally intelligent.

I'm very much a, I'm a visual learner, you know, I learn by doing, I don't learn by reading, I just, that's not my learning style. I used to go in there, I'd spend the morning designing a motor go-kart and then as soon as I was allowed out, I'd go and work. I used to go and work for a local brother who had a bike shop. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1613s) gave me a job at the age of 14 to keep me out of trouble. I've never told him that actually what he did was he gave me an income so I could go and get into more trouble, but that's beside the point.

I had a little bit of money and I'd go off and spend two or three hours building this motor go-kart and throughout my those two GCSE years, I think I produced a petrol go-kart that was, which then another young brother bought off me because he felt it was very unsuitable to have a [go-kart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1643s).

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1645s)

He bought it and used it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1646s)

He bought it off, I think he part-exchanged it for a keyboard and some money because he was just concerned that I was, you know, going to the world with my...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1659s)

Your motor go-kart by the wayside, exactly, yeah, yeah. So having had those two years, what did you go to work full-time at 16 or did you go, did you stay on at college or?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1672s)

Uh, yeah, so I stayed working for this brother at the bike shop until I was 17 when I got my driving license. Yeah, that's interesting because then I wanted to go to college. I wanted to go to the local college, actually, because I was such a problem. A local brother had spoken to John Hales at the time and John Hales actually said the best thing for Murray would be for him to go back to mainstream school because I was...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1703s)

He needs the discipline.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1704s)

Yeah, but anyway, the local authority, if you like, in Northampton decided amongst themselves, so they discussed this and decided amongst themselves, well, they'd give me one more chance and then if I messed up again, they'd then send me back to mainstream school. But of course, I was very much, when I heard this, I was like, I don't want to go back to mainstream school, you know, because bear in mind, I'd effectively be two years behind.

I didn't learn till a long time later, they were actually looking to put me into a local private school, about something like £12,000 a year or something ridiculous. Wow. Because I'd never get back into that school I was at. But yeah, and yeah, I think they got their knuckles wrapped because they didn't send me back to school.

So yeah, when I was 16, when I was 17, I wanted to go to college, but they decided that I might get into trouble if I went to college. You know, it's construction college, should be terrible and, you know, there'll be lots of drugs and bad influences and girls and, you know, things that might lead a young man [astray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1775s). The fact I was quite, I was pretty much a past master of getting myself into trouble without all those things.

So instead, I went to work for a brother in Bedford who was a general builder. And I earned terrible money, but I actually, I viewed it, I had four years of college training on the tools, actually doing the work. So, and I'm thankful for that because it's actually what I fell back on when I left the church in 2018, 2019, lost my job then. But, so get to my teenage years and, you know, I mean, we could talk forever about detail, but my teenage years was when I really, well, let's put it, so when I was 19, I wanted to leave.

I remember, so I'd, I was, there were three Murrays, three personalities going on here. It's going to make me sound like a complete nutter, but there was the Murray that went to church and there was the Murray that took part in the meetings. There was the Murray that, you know, would preach a good preaching. There was the Murray that was the entertainer, the host, the, you know, what everybody saw.

Then there was the Murray that hung out with his mates and we did things like jump on a train and go to London for a Saturday and we'd go to a restaurant and have a pint in the pub, but we'd keep ourselves to ourselves and we didn't do anything particularly, you know...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1883s)

But to explain to our non-listeners, to do something like that, going to London for a day might have been okay, but the pint in the pub and the restaurant was definitely not okay, was it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1894s)

Absolutely. And even, even jumping on a train, you know, two young brothers, 19-year-old, going to London on a train, it would have been, you know, my parents wouldn't have known every time that I went. They might have found out afterwards that I'd been there, but, you know, normally I was with someone else whose parents were perhaps a little bit more broad-minded.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1919s)

It's almost synonymous with having a bit too much freedom, isn't it? Two 19-year-old lads going to London for the day, it's, yeah, it could...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1928s)

Only end in trouble.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1929s)

Yeah, and the other thing is, is John Hales, I think he said something like, what would you want to go to London for? It's the city of sin, didn't he, something like that?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1936s)

Yes.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1937s)

Yeah, even going to London was a big...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1941s)

Was a big no-no, yeah. But actually, when you go there, you find that it's actually really interesting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1946s)

But it's also, just to put, you've mentioned a few times as teenagers, you know, I'm getting into trouble. We all understand what you mean, but for listeners who are non-brethren, like Murray, going to London for a day and going to a pub and a restaurant is getting into trouble. And that kind of puts it into context, doesn't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1966s)

Well, this is it. You know, when people say, when I talk to people now and they say, but what were you doing? You know, like they think, and they think you're going to tell them that I was, you know, murdering people or raping people or doing something really shocking. And it's like, no, I was going to pubs and I went to a cinema and I went to a restaurant. They're like, were you scared doing that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1993s)

Oh yeah. I couldn't have done that. I was too scared.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1997s)

No, I couldn't have.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=1999s)

We used to do it. And I know when we used to go into a restaurant in London, we'd always be looking over our shoulder to see if there was anybody about that might see us and get us into trouble.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2011s)

Yeah, I was more scared of, I was more scared of God's punishment on me rather than getting into trouble, really. I had this constant fear of that. Yeah, and that's a very real fear, that is. And that's a very, and I think, part of what primed me for leaving and actually surviving on what I'm gonna say, my survival in the outside world, if you like, in the normal world, was the fact that I tested that quite well growing up.

You know, even, you know, I remember, I think it was Jim Symington said, if you saw someone in the cinema queue, you could only assume they're on the road to hell. This is what I've been told, you know. So what, I never actually went to a cinema, I went to like the IMAX cinema in the Science Museum and I justified that because it was the Science Museum, it wasn't the cinema, you know, it's the IMAX. Yeah, who are you kidding, mate?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2078s)

It's a film on a big screen.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2083s)

It's a film on a big screen, yeah. But you know, it was just this, it was this pre-programmed thing in the back of your head that, you know, I'm hell-bound, you know, yeah. And yeah, so as I was, Murray was the one that even my closest friends didn't know about. So you know, the lads I'd go to London with and that was the Murray that would disappear out on a Friday night and go to and end up in a nightclub and also experimented [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2113s) young ladies, did things that, you know, normal teenage boys do, but it was very, very abnormal in brethren.

And to the point that, so that's what I say, when I was 19, I thought, I need to leave. I can't, because I needed to confess that I'd slept with, you know, I wasn't a virgin anymore. And it was about the time when I got married, [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2143s) I got married in 2003 in the end, sort of early 2000, you started getting, you got interviews before you got married and, you know, you're asked questions, are you in the clear, are you pure, have you confessed all your sins and this sort of thing.

And I had this problem because if I, I say I had a problem in my head, because if I confessed that I'd been with women, which was the right thing I should do to get myself in the clear to get married, I then become labeled secondhand goods as far as the brethren were concerned. So my chances of marrying anyone remotely, normal, say marrying anyone I fancied, were very, very slim.

Yeah, you know, and so this, so I had this dilemma, do I incriminate myself by confession or do I just get up and leave? Because clearly I don't fit, ever, you know, all my life I just didn't fit. I was wracked with guilt my life, always, I was guilty, I'd always done something I shouldn't do.

You know, like you said about going to London and you feel guilty and you know, we get up for the Supper at 6 o'clock next morning and go to the Lord's Supper, Holy Communion, as non-brethren might recognise it as, and we'd go there and I'd be like, I'd just be a fraud, you know, I'd be taking part in the formalities of the sermon or the Lord's Supper and I'd just be, and I'd sit there and I just felt terrible, miserable.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2248s)

And just to sort of clarify that again, I'm sure it hasn't changed, but from what I remember, the Lord's Supper, as they call it, which is early communion, they put a great importance on. And the whole idea of a Saturday evening was that you kind of washed yourself of your sins, cleansed yourself and went there with a pure of your mind. So if you're going there Friday night, you've been out in a nightclub and had a good time, you probably go there with a very sort of confused state of mind, I imagine.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2277s)

Yes, yeah. And not only that, as a brother, as a man, you were expected to take part. And there was an order of service and it moved, it was very fluid, you know, and it was governed by the hymns that the sisters gave out. And it would, you know, you could move from one part of the service to another.

And you'd be sitting there trying to think, I don't know how you ever found this, Ross and Gilli, but you'd be sitting there thinking, what am I going to say? And you just about got something sorted out and someone else would, you know, a sister would give out a hymn that moved you on to the next part of the service, yeah, yeah. And you'd be sitting there, I know, you think like, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2315s) then, you know, I remember people going to Murray, why did you always get up at the end and you know, you wait, that's like, yeah, if you knew what I went through.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2325s)

I did one of two things, I either got up straight after we'd had the emblems, or I got up last like you did.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2334s)

Yeah, yeah. And it was kind of, but you weren't also, you weren't meant to say the same thing every week, you had to have something fresh. And I think the other thing on that is, and I've discussed it with people who have still kept their faith, in that the amount of times you actually consider what you, you know, look back at what you said, and I don't know if you agree with this, but 99% of the time you weren't actually thinking about [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2364s) you were speaking to God or to the Lord about, it was always about how it would sound to those surrounding you.

Yeah, so it wasn't really, it wasn't real in your faith, it was more about impressing your peers and trying to impress the people who were around you. Exactly, it was all about blowing smoke up everyone else's asses, it was nothing to do with my relationship with God, no, nothing, you know, it was dressed up as that.

Yeah, you know, but there's no more given out hymns, I mean, the spirit moving, yeah, yeah, any spirit that was probably whiskey from the night before, yeah, yeah. Let's put it this way, you get up at 6am with a shocking hangover and try and sit for an hour.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2418s)

Many times I've done that.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2420s)

Yeah, pretend to be godly and you know, it's a horrible way though, it's a horrible, at the end before I left, it eats away at you, it does. That living like that is, it's unbearable. It's living a lie, isn't it, to yourself? We can laugh about this now, yeah, we can laugh about it now, but the pressure and the guilt that I felt, and I think everyone here would testify to that, knowing that I was actually a complete fraud and I was trying really hard not to be. Yeah, absolutely, I just couldn't be what I was meant to be, no matter how hard I tried.

You know, we were meant to read two or three hours of ministry a day and this kind of thing. I could not get into it, you know, give me a...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2479s)

I've always said, I think I've actually read more ministry since I left the brethren than I ever did when I was in, because you have a different viewpoint on it when you read it when you leave.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2489s)

If you ever did read it, if you ever did read it in there, well for me, I was often just looking for the juicy bits.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2499s)

And also, you were meant to get an impression in the Supper, weren't you? In the family I lived with in Bristol, they spent like about two or three hours reading ministry, looking up all these references after the Supper and I was just sort of like twiddling my thumbs because I didn't know what to do.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2516s)

I went to sleep because I had too much port in the Supper.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2522s)

Yeah, so that's perhaps something else, if we can pause on that before we move on a bit, Murray. But in the Supper for communion, they would have 40% strong port, wouldn't they? Yeah, to represent the Lord's blood. And it's one of my personal bugbears that they would actually encourage young children to drink that to the point where if they actually took a sip of this 40% alcohol, it's wonderful because they're having a sip of, you know, they're embracing the death of the [Lord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2552s) and so on.  
*(note \- the port wine is actually 20% alcohol, not 40%)*

And it's one of my big bugbears. Mainstream churches tend not to use alcoholic communion now for that reason. Yeah, they certainly don't for children, absolutely don't for children.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2564s)

You put in a post, didn't you, earlier on Facebook?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2567s)

Yeah, it's actually...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2568s)

Illegal to give children, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2571s)

Yeah, just on that, I have touched on it in my book, but I do sort of, I feel a certain guilt towards my own children in that you were forced to, yeah, you know, you, if they didn't take the wine, because often the little children didn't like it, they didn't like the big cup, they'd push it away and, you know, I remember being guiled at because I gave up, yeah, you know, this is, you're talking about a five, six-month-old baby here.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2599s)

So, so if we pause that and then we'll move on to what happened next for you, Murray, but what you're actually saying there is that you would be frowned upon because you were not comfortable with giving your five, six-month-old baby 40% alcohol.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2616s)

Well, it wasn't even, it was more of the fact that he didn't want it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2621s)

Yeah, and you didn't insist. So you didn't insist and if you...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2624s)

If you didn't, if you didn't keep at it, even if they were pushing it away, pushing it away, yeah, it was frowned upon. Because, yeah, and I actually remember, I remember once because, one, I think it was probably Scott, but he took the bread but wouldn't have the wine. And I remember after the meeting, a certain, certain brother picked the cup up and brought it over to me to give to him. How old would he have been? How old would he have been at that point? He's seven, six months old. Oh my God. But he brought it over to me, totally embarrassed me before anybody else got off.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2666s)

Yeah, oh yeah, that happened in our subdivision quite a bit.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2672s)

It's ridiculous, it was, it was ridiculous. And I'll say it was to my shame, but we were taught to, we were told that we should drink into the cup, you didn't just have a sip, you, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I've got one hell of a cavern in my mouth and I...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2692s)

Did they have to fill the cup up after you'd had it, Murray?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2695s)

It was a little mission of mine to see how much I can make it drop when I... Yeah, but then of course, then I'd get home and I used to do this, I'd get home and I'd have a bottle of port in the fridge because latterly they chilled it. Yeah, actually, when you chill it, it's much more drinkable and it's actually quite, and I used to, my way around it, so it was lovely, you could feel the Lord moving inside you as this port went down, you could feel it run down, he was flipping his cold alcohol, that's why, mate, at six o'clock in the morning.

You wouldn't have breakfast before the Supper. And then I'd get home and I'd have another glass, I've got a taste for it. It was like, I like that feeling, it's like you just, that warm, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's like a bit of a thing actually after the Supper, that was in recent years, not long before I left anyway, it was the sort of a thing that you made sure you had a bottle of port in the fridge for after the Supper and that was your, that was the start of your Sunday, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, and then driving and everything else, you get to the 10:30 service [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2768s) a thumping bad head because you...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2770s)

Basically started a bit early. I mean, it's laughable, but it's actually, it's not. I mean, serious, as I made that point on that post, it is illegal to give alcohol to under five-year-olds, end of. And it's, you know, what you're teaching those children or what children are being taught, makes you wonder, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah, anyway, we digress, but it's what these conversations are all about. Murray, carry on, you're 19\.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2799s)

I'm 19, yeah. So we'll fast forward anyway. I got married, I didn't leave and I don't think I didn't make a decision not to leave, but I met my wife-to-be and it kind of worked. And I want to just put this out there now, my wife, she's a lovely person and she still is a lovely person. My stance, I kind of took advantage, I'm going to say, of circumstances which enabled me to be a normal Plymouth brother in the church.

I was 23, so I was pushing it a bit, you know, 21, 22 was, everyone was married. I was 23, I couldn't afford to get married, really. I hadn't, because if you bear in mind for listeners not in the church, you had to buy, it was the brother's responsibility, the man's responsibility to buy a house. It was the woman's responsibility to furnish it. But you had to buy a detached house. I [couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2869s) buy a flat, I couldn't buy a semi, I couldn't buy a terrace, it had to be a detached house.

So, and then also they were getting very, very picky about areas as well. There would be areas that weren't suitable for brethren not to live, to live in. So the bar was quite high and I was falling short of the bar in many ways. And if you like, I was living this fake life, I was living a facade really in the brethren. And my facade was about to be ripped down because I was getting to a point where I couldn't go any further without actually putting my hands up and saying, do you know what, I'm not the person you think I am. I can't afford to buy a house, I'm in trouble, I've been, you know, I'm not pure as far as they're concerned, I'm not a virgin.

And then I met my wife. I mean, her brother actually married my sister, which was how I came across her. And I'd made a point of never, ever, this is a brethren word, fraternizing with brethren girls, so sisters, women in the brethren. The reason I didn't do that was because I only had 50% control over it. If she decided to confess that, you know, we'd been doing things we shouldn't, then I was banged, right? So I tended to, I tended to sort of, I didn't shit on my own doorstep, basically, I played away. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2983s) not selling myself very well, are you?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2985s)

But we understand what you mean.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=2988s)

Yeah. So anyway, and I met my wife-to-be and we didn't do anything particularly abnormal, but we did probably venture a bit further than I had with any other brethren girl, to the point I thought, shucks, I'm gonna have to do something about this. And basically, the easy route for me was to marry her. And we managed to get a house and we cobbled a few things together and, you know, there were some very generous brethren that lent me money to help me buy my house and, you know, so I kind of winged it for a bit.

But then I think it was about two or three years into that, into my marriage, that it all came out about what I'd been doing before I got married, right. And I won't go into [details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3039s) of how it came out, but it all came out and it was a case of, I actually got withdrawn from. So my wife, bless her, she was, quite rightly so, she felt she'd been cheated on in the sense that, you know, she thought she'd married one thing and she'd married something else.

And this, I'm not proud of this, it's just, it's a fact, it's what it was. And actually, that was, I was 26 at this time and that's actually when I knew that I was saved. That's when I found, I finally got, I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3081s) conscious that I was saved. And I just, I just put this here as well, I say, I tell people and this is true, I've got my faith, I am a Christian by faith, I'm not religious. I have, you know, and I respect people for their beliefs.

I don't force what, if someone wants to talk about it, I'll talk about it, I'll help someone if I can, but I am a Christian, I believe in God and I believe in Jesus and the Spirit and [nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3112s) ever will take me away from that. But I understand that other people view things very differently and have a different take on it.

And yeah, so I was withdrawn from and I was going over all these matters and, you know, I want to go over these matters, you have, basically had to write down my history. And I was interested, was Steve, Steven Gear, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3142s) he said about, you know, reading your history out like a, I forget the word he used, was like a shopping list, just lists, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3151s)

Yeah, and this is what you actually got up to that they're going to find sinful, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3155s)

Yeah, well, I basically wrote a dirty novel. Yeah, you know, for the priest to read, you know, this is my story. I would have put, Mills and Boone had nothing on me, I'll tell you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3171s)

In a sense, that's what's so wrong about it, it's their personal things. Yeah, and you know, growing up in a normal situation, I'm sure most people do things that they perhaps wish they hadn't or perhaps wish they'd done more or whatever, but it's nobody's business.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3187s)

Exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3188s)

It's not public, it's not public washing, is it? You might want to tell your partner if you felt, but it's not public washing and they make it public washing, don't they?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3197s)

Exactly, exactly. And then also, it's worth pointing out that the types of things that you put in there, they're actually, and this is the thing, I felt I was abnormal. You know, I thought I must be wrong, I must be weird, I must be a pervert, I must be strange because I like all these things and they're just normal.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3219s)

They're just an 18-year-old lad, it's an 18-year-old lad doing what 18-year-old lads do, finding out about the big wide world.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3228s)

Yeah, and you know, but the problem is, you've written this down and somewhere in the ether, there's these documents that I've written of all these confessions of things I've done, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3241s)

So did the priest, if you wrote it down and obviously they come and see you, do they then take those notes away? Was that how it worked or?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3248s)

They do, yeah. But the interesting thing, the teaching on it, and I'll come on to this because my big issue with the brethren is that they don't know how to practice what they preach, they don't actually understand what they're preaching. That's the big thing that I've come to. And I believe what was said was, write your sins down, take them to somebody.

They said, and I think what they said was a true priest wouldn't even read them. A true priest would take those and, you know, the idea was he put it in the fire. You've come to it as a person, you've come, use your own conviction, you've had the balls to write it down and you've had the balls to bring it to me. I don't want to know about it, yeah, it's covered.

You've done that, the blood of Christ covers that. That's in my basic understanding, that's what [Christianity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3308s) is about, that's what confession is about. You don't have to pay for it, you don't have to, you know, there's no, it's forgiven, it's forgotten and it's between me and God. Whereas they would take it, I know that there was a brother in Northampton had a ring binder on me in his study. There was a ring binder on Murray, along with a ring binder on other people as well. And he took great delight telling me one day, he said, just by the way, my house, you know, I've destroyed everything, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3338s) know, this was like four or five years after.

But so anyway, this time when I was, I want to share this because it's important to me. So when I was withdrawn from, I had my eldest lad was born, he would have been three, two or three. And I was living in, I moved out of the main house and I've got like a garden, a man cave [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3368s) the bottom of the garden. And that I was living there. And what was quite interesting was, I would, at that point, I was selling engineering supplies for a company in Bedford, a brethren company.

And we were selling Speedglas welding helmets and they then got bought by 3M, the big, the big 3M, the big American company, yeah. And [3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3398s), I was actually headhunted by 3M to go work for them selling the Speedglas helmets because I've been selling them for three or four, you know, I knew the product. And it all happened at this time, it was almost like, so I was, that was, I was 26, that was 2006\.

And it was like, you know, it would have been 10, 15 grand a year more than I was earning. And bear in mind, I was earning quite well because of the brethren standards of earning, whatever it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3428s), almost like this was an opportunity for me to actually go and, you know, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't bring myself to actually leave and then leave my son and knowing again at that point I'd lose my son.

And I struggled with this and it was, I think it was about three months, three or four months and I wasn't getting anywhere. The priests were coming to see me and I was feeling more and more, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3459s) know, I was trying to be good, but I wasn't really feeling it and they were, you know, they weren't feeling that I was good enough to go back.

And then on, it was a Saturday, I went out, I went off on a Saturday and I went to a pub and I had a drink and I came home and it was a bit, had a bit of a bad day. And then on this, it was on the Sunday morning, my wife came down and she brought my breakfast down and opened the door and she [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3489s) it just inside the door in the little kitchen area and my son came in and he was, I say he was three, and I remember to this day, I pretended I was still asleep and he came up and he leant over me and gave me a kiss and he just said, "Don't go away again today, Dad."

And my wife told me, she said, "I never told him to say that." That was literally from him. And I was a mess. But I did go, I did go off that day, I went off. I was, and I went into town and I got drunk, I did things that I'm genuinely ashamed of. And I was walking back, it was Sunday night, I was walking back across the park. Was it, yeah, it was 2006 because Bruce Hales was coming to Northampton on the Tuesday.

And I think this was part of why I was, I'd found out this, this was part of why I was really down because that was quite a big event for Northampton and my wife wasn't going to be there and I wasn't going to be there. And this was like, and I think kind of my reaction was to just blow off and go and do, you know, I went and did my worst, if you like.

And I was walking back across the park in Northampton and I stank of smoke, I was drunk, well, I was obviously, I knew what was going on, but I'd had too much to drink and I just, I felt really, really dirty and I was a wreck. And I thought, you know, I'm going to hell. I genuinely thought I was going to hell and that's when I was, the first time in my life, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3602s) was scared. I thought there was nothing, no option for me, I'm going to burn in a lake of fire.

And that was, and funny enough, there was a cousin of my, a distant cousin of mine, he was driving past the park at that time and he stopped, but he shouldn't have stopped, but he did, you know. And he ran across the park, probably ran 100 meters, threw his arms around my neck and said, "Murray, it's lovely to see you, we can't wait for you to be [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3632s)." And I said, "I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, you know, I'll, you won't be seeing me again, I'm finished, I'm done, I'm finished, there's no hope for me." And he goes, "No, Murray, there is hope for you, you're okay, you'll be okay."

And that was like, wow, you know, where did that come from? And I got home and I remember going up, I went into the main house, I went upstairs, I ripped all my clothes off, threw them out the window. I was absolutely, I was having a shower, I was just trying to wash myself clean, literally [physically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3662s) clean. And my wife said, "Do you want me to call the priests?" I said, "Yeah, you can if you want, I'm beyond caring."

Anyway, they turned, two brothers turned up and I told them everything. I sort of calmed down a bit by then, it was, I kind of resigned myself to, you know, when you cry, I don't know if you ever cried so much, you just run out, there's nothing left to cry. It's like, yeah, and I told them what I'd done and they sat there and they looked at each other, they just shook their heads and they looked at each other, they're like, well, I don't know, I don't know.

And of course, that filled me with an enormous amount of confidence. It was like, yeah, I'm definitely finished, definitely, I'm done. And they literally didn't know what to say or what to do. And in the end, I said to them, I said, "Can [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3716s) pray? Will you pray with me?" And they sort of looked at each other, said, "Well, I suppose we can, yeah." So we all knelt down and I waited for one of them to start praying and they didn't, nobody said anything. So I started, I started praying and I can't remember what I said, I don't know.

All I remember is a hand on my shoulder and the Lord said to me, he said, "I've got you, Murray, you're mine." And these are the two priests, they were the other side of the room. And they tried to tell me since then that maybe I'm not saved because, you know, and they've tried to unsave me. I'm sorry, I said, I'm sorry, that happened, I can't explain it, I can't tell you anything. I know at that point, I know, I knew I was saved.

So that's where, you know, that's where I stand on that. And they've tried time and time again since then, you know, every time I failed, they'd say, "Well, we'd have to question whether you are, Murray." You know, [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3780s), you can't be saved today and lost tomorrow, that's what you preach. Yeah, you go and study your scripture. "Oh, yes, but you know, the way..." No, there's no buts, I was saved on that day, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3793s)

So just if I can just paint a picture of what led up to that a little bit. So you were withdrawn from at that point, yeah? And you had your house and you had, living in a shed or something in the garden, that you had to live separate from your wife and young child?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3809s)

Correct.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3810s)

And was your wife confined in any way at that point?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3813s)

Yeah, she was confined and she was actually not allowed to go to the meeting where Bruce Hales came to, right, that's why...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3820s)

I wonder, because you mentioned that, yeah, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3821s)

Which they actually said afterwards she should have gone. Yeah, she shouldn't have been, but again, that's the Chinese whispers, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this all this...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3831s)

So you're in a situation where you're having to live separate in a separate building and your wife was cooking meals and bringing them down to you? I'm only painting that picture because my understanding that that is what happens, isn't it? You have to live separately. And what that can do in your own home, with your family you love, bringing meals to you on a plate, then walking away and not hardly speaking to you. And what that can do to one's mental well-being, I think, or does, you know, it can destroy one's mental health, can't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3865s)

Yeah, well, I think you're dead right there, Jacky, and that, and part of the reason for telling this is that, yes, what I realize is over my life, my mental health hasn't been stimulated, it's been eroded. Yeah, I believe in myself and I think a lot of brethren would bear this out, a lot of people coming out of that system, I think will bear it out, that your whole thinking, you get yourself into such a situation, you don't believe in yourself.

You know, you don't trust yourself, you're not meant to, you're taught not to. You're taught to say, "Oh, wretched man that I am," every morning, yeah, and to the point that you actually don't, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3911s) know, yeah, can I even make a right decision?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3913s)

Can I even, yeah, they absolutely smash your self-esteem, don't they?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3918s)

Yeah, am I qualified to decide whether something's right or wrong? Yeah. To the point that you're asking. All the time, everyone's running around asking everyone else for approval to do something to the point that nobody's got a spine because, you know, and that's, anyway, they actually spoke to Bruce Hales about me on the Tuesday and he, very briefly, he said, "Oh, what Murray needs to do is he needs to keep a quarter of an hour timesheet and report at the end of every day what he's been doing."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3955s)

Well, there's a straight jacket if ever I saw one, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3962s)

Yeah, 15-minute timesheet.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3964s)

You did it, didn't you, Murray?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3966s)

I did it. And I did that for four years. Whoa, four years. I would go to a brother's house at the end of every day and he looked through my timesheet and he'd sign it off at the end of the day. Somewhere, they're probably still at my old house in the loft somewhere, there's reams of timesheets. I'm sorry, sometimes I'd go two or three hours and think, I haven't filled this, and I'll be like, it was full of, yeah, because it was effect, oh, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=3997s) was, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, and you know, you should do...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4003s)

Right there, isn't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4004s)

Yeah, yeah. And the point was, if I'd done something that was frowned upon, that wasn't on my timesheet.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4011s)

No, you're not going to write it down anyway, are you? Of course it wasn't. 7 to 7:30, went to the pub, had two pints.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4018s)

Yes. Sticking in my car reading ministry. Yes, exactly. What have you been doing? Going over my impressions from the Supper. The Supper, yes. Over a Guinness. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4036s)

Yeah, oh gosh.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4039s)

Yeah, but then of course, but from that point on, everything I did was under scrutiny and the suspicion and yeah, the truth is, I couldn't stop myself from making friends outside the church. I am, you know, I was in a, I was a buyer for a workwear company. I was buying, I had a lot of contacts, a lot of, I, you know, I did quite well at it. Well, they certainly seem to appreciate [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4069s) doing the job anyway.

And but I did and I'd go for coffees with people and they want to take you for meals and, you know, who doesn't, who says no to a free dinner? But an interesting thing is also, they couldn't get their head around the fact that how a man could go for a coffee with a woman and it could just be business. It had to be something corrupt. And you could tell them till you're blue in the face, there's nothing in it. I'm not the slightest bit interested in her. We went for a coffee. "Why did you do that?" "Well, because I can."

"Yes, I'm sorry, I shouldn't," you know, and blah, you know, but it was, they just, it had to be more than I said it was, you know. Sometimes I might have fancied it being more than I said it was, but that's beside the point. But the truth was that often I would be apologizing for something I hadn't really done. Yes, I've been, I've been perhaps a bit friendly with somebody, I've been a bit too much, but anyway, fast forward to 2016\.

We had, I was, so I think we've been married 16 years before I left, no, 15, 14, 15 years. And it'd been hard work and my wife, bless her, she didn't trust me, she didn't, I didn't trust myself and I was trying to do the right things and kept getting into trouble and we weren't really in love. It was, you know, hindsight, I realized that's what it was, it was sad.

And you know, but 2016 came and we were refurbishing the school, the primary school in Northampton and I was meant to be running the project. And I said to myself, I thought, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4197s) know what, I can't do this anymore. I'm going to finish this project and I'm just gonna go. I'm not gonna cause any trouble, I don't want to make a scene, I'm just going to leave. I can't live this life anymore. And this was my plan.

And then there was a young brother, been, he'd been in Sydney, him and his wife had stayed in Sydney for six weeks for something and he came back and he'd had meetings [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4227s) Bruce Hales and he came back with really enthusiastic and really genuine teaching on a scripture, the man possessed by demons in the tombs is cutting himself with stones and then the Lord cast out the demons, they went into the pigs and they all ran into the sea or something.

Anyway, it was a scripture that was often talked about and discussed and he came back and he was really, he had this sort of fresh life about him. And I thought, okay, John, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna get you to put your money where your mouth is. So I phoned him up and said that I'm in trouble. No, I said, can you help me? And he thought I was asking him to come and work on the school and I said, "No, no, I need you to come and talk to me."

So I told, you know, he came along and I told him what I was struggling with and everything and he was like, okay. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4284s) he got someone else involved because it's worth, for those that aren't, there's always, you always have two priests. It's always, it's based on a scripture, I think it's on the witness of something like more than one, like one person isn't enough to pass judgment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4303s)

And just to pause that point, there's always two priests, but you're not allowed support as the person receiving the priestly, are you? I mean, absolutely no, no, no, you couldn't have your friend there or, oh no.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4314s)

And very much it would be considered that the priest would be the person to help, yeah, you know. But yeah, and he called someone else in and for a few months and we worked through a lot of things and, you know, I tried to sort my life out again and get myself on the straight and narrow. But then the official priests, the older, got wind of there's something going on and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4344s) were like, "Oh, well, you know, John's not qualified to do this," and they started getting involved.

And they thought, well, they better speak to Australia, to go to Sydney and speak to Bruce Hales, but I don't think they did. I think actually they spoke to Roger Kirkpatrick, who was obviously a fairly powerful henchman. And he said, well, you know, he passed his judgment on it and I think on the light of his word, they decided I needed to be confined. So I was confined on, it was actually May the 7th, I think, 2017\. Yeah, because that's right, '16 we did the school, there's a few months away then.

So, and the reason I remember that is because I'd actually had a digger delivered that day to do the garden. And it worked out quite well in my favour that I was stopped from going to the evening and the weekends.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4415s)

You had all this time on your hands.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4418s)

Yeah, I jumped on a digger and did my garden. And so they decided I'd be confined, which meant, so I lived in my house with my family, three children at the time, but I was in the spare room, went on the suite, I had my little space in there. And again, my wife would cook food for me, but she carried on going to, she carried on going to the meeting, she wasn't confined this time. And the children, so her and the children would carry on going to the meetings and I would stay at home.

And this went on for about, coming [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4459s) a year, I believe, and I kind of didn't get anywhere. And then that's right, another, by this time, I think about four people have been brought into the mix, four or five people knew what my Murray's troubles were and, you know, this priestly circle was getting ever bigger, you know.

And then there was another, another brother was going to Germany and he was going, very privileged, he was going to, he was very [close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4489s) to Bruce Hales, basically because he was a really good musician. And he went to entertain him, that was the top and bottom of it. And to be fair, he was a nice enough guy, but he was no more spiritual than, you know, anyone else, he was just a very good musician and so it made him very popular.

And I was asked to write down, you know, everything I've been going on with, everything I've done and, you know, they'll take this. And one thing we were told was if you're serious about getting free of your sins, you don't minimize them. You know, so if there was a detail and I genuinely did this because I was genuinely wanting to just get on with life, I couldn't live in this void. If I wasn't sure about a detail, how many times I've been to this place [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4543s) how long, you know, I erred on the extreme side rather than minimize it.

So they couldn't come back to me in, you know, a few years' time and say, "You know, oh, but you didn't say this." So it's okay, this, this was a great long list. And anyway, this brother got back and his dad came to me at work and he said, "Oh, Murray, we'd like to come and see you at half past five tonight, if that's okay." And I thought this was great because they normally came after the evening service, so it'd be like nine o'clock, half past eight, nine. So I think it's 7:15 on the Tuesday was the time for the ministry meeting.

And I thought, no, I thought, oh, well, maybe this is, I'm going to be restored, you know, get back to the church, because they want to come and see me, it's time for them to put it to the brethren and then I can perhaps go to the evening meeting. [Anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4602s), I thought this, I was quite excited for most of the afternoon until late afternoon, I got a message from my wife, something to the effect, she said, "I'm praying for you, I hope you'll take what they have to say in the spirit of love it's intended," or something like that.

And that was the moment I thought, ah, this may not be what I think is, might not be going back. And no, basically they put it to Bruce Hales and he said, "Well, I think Murray should be withdrawn from." [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4641s) to be confined, you're in the church, but you're not allowed to take part in the church, but you're still part of the church. To be withdrawn from, you are not part of the church, you're out of the church, but it's with a view to recovery.

So just to try and sum it up for those that don't, but basically I was no longer [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4672s) the brethren, I was withdrawn from. And by nine o'clock, so my wife had packed my bags, half past five they came to see me, seven o'clock they went, 7:15 they put it to the congregation, after the evening service they came back, by half past nine I was moved out of my house into another house. It belonged to a young brother, one of the elder, one of the priests, his son had a house that he wasn't living in.

And I can't, I went with this and when I look back on it, I think, why did I let them do that to me? But they did, forget it. And that really was the beginning of the end. I went on a four-week bender, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4717s) I think that was the end of November, right up till Christmas Day. I maxed out a credit card, I just did everything. I went and spent Christmas with someone that I knew down in Surrey and he was actually driving back Boxing Day that I suddenly thought, "Murray, what are you doing? You're going to lose everything, you're going to lose, you're going to lose your family."

And that, this was the big thing. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4747s) I had a really good job, I had a lovely house, you know, look at it from the outside, people looked at, "Wow, Murray's got everything," you know, two cars, three lovely children, lovely house, big good job, but I was miserable, I was absolutely miserable. And you can process losing your job, yeah, you process living on less money, yeah, it's difficult, but you can do it. I'm gonna lose my house, yeah, you can deal with that. You're gonna lose your children, that you cannot.

And then, and then people will say, "Oh, yes, but you can have, you know, you've got rights, you've got this." It's traumatic for everybody involved. And it's always traumatic for children when parents separate. It's not uncommon, you know, but there's an added layer or multiple layers of trauma.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4810s)

There is an added layer for children of parents like your children, Anne, and yours, Murray, because if a marriage breaks down, it's sad, it happens and sometimes there can be acrimony and there can be lawyers and there can be difficulties, but often there ends up being a status quo where the children end up having both parents in their lives, yes, albeit living separately, sometimes not always, but that is usually the ultimate aim of most people and actually of the courts, yes, that have both parents in their lives.

Yes, that just doesn't happen in a brethren situation because the children that are in, they are gradually, even if they, I mean, even if you are able to see them, they are gradually drip-fed, I would only say poison, about the parent that's left, aren't [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4863s)?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4863s)

Yeah, absolutely, and that is...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4866s)

What's wrong, just wrong.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4868s)

Okay, I'll come on to that because I've had a really, really sad email from my eldest son two weeks ago. But it's literally, it's what you say, it's the drip-feeding, it's painful. And so in the light of that, I then phoned up the priest, the elders, and said, "Look, I've come around, I've been doing this, I've been away." That's right, because they hadn't been to see me, I don't think, they hadn't been to see me for, they put me in this house [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4898s) they did not come to see me for at least two or three weeks.

And when they did, I kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did, obviously didn't tell them I was doing anything, you know, doing stuff I shouldn't be doing as far as they're concerned. But then I said, "Look," I got them round and I said, "This is what I've been doing," and whatever. And they took my credit, all my bank cards away from me and again, I let them do this.

And they then gave me, I was given, I think I was given £120 or £100, £120 a week for my food and fuel [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4939s) my car to get to and from work, but that was given to me in vouchers. So I didn't have cash, yeah. So I had, I'm a 37-year-old man, 37, 38-year-old guy on a six-figure income and he has £120 a week in vouchers.

And what I actually used to do was I would, so I had a Tesco reloadable card for my food and I had Morrison's vouchers for my fuel. And Morrison's at that time gave change on their vouchers. So I would go, £11 worth of fuel in my car.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4988s)

You used a lot of fuel.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=4990s)

£11 worth of fuel and I got £9 change and I'd do that twice a week and on a Thursday night, I'd walk into the village where they had a music jam on with £18 in my pocket. And that's another story. But anyway, so this is going back to this brother come back from Germany having been with Bruce Hales and Bruce Hales had said, "We need clear evidence that the Lord's come in and taken up Murray's case and he's never going to sin again," or words to that effect.

I forget the exact words, but that was the, so [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5032s) said, so I said, "Okay, what does that look like?" And they said, "We'll know, we'll know when it's happened, we'll know." Right. So I've been on my four, five-week bender, I've thrown in the towel, I've submitted. I then spent six months where all I did was go to work, go shopping for my food, I went for a run every day and I set myself a target once a month, I'd run around Pitsford Reservoir, which is like a seven and a half mile run.

Just that was my only focus in life and I did, I read the scriptures and I read ministry and I looked up stuff and I wrote [reams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5082s) and reams of notes. I was trying to find something, but I don't know what I was trying to find. And the priests would come, they'd come twice a week, always two of them, like we said, sometimes as many as five. They'd come twice a week, they'd sit around in this room and they'd basically interview me, you know, "How have you been getting on? What have you done? What have you come to?"

And I had to demonstrate some kind of spiritual progress every time they came. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5113s) I was trying to genuinely demonstrate it, but truthfully, it was a lot of it, basically, I think what they were waiting for me to, what they were wanting me to say was, "I will never fraternize with anybody in the world ever again," you know, socially, physically, anything, you know. Well, I wasn't prepared to do that because I know with the best will in the world, knowing who I am, I will do it.

Yeah, I could go, I might go a year and be really, really good and [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5151s) I'll slip up and I'll be back to, and I'd got myself out of trouble time and time before by saying what they wanted me to say, but not really believing it and then just being this miserable liar, basically, because I'm living one thing and doing another.

But obviously, you imagine this, they come, they kept saying, "You're making really good progress, really good progress." And I'll be like, right, maybe I'm just, I'm, you know, I felt like I was nearly there, I was nearly there, keep going, keep going. And obviously, I was getting more and more depressed, more and more...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5190s)

What was your mental health like through these months?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5192s)

My mental health, bear in mind, I was a manager at work. Um, and I had, I had a team working, I was down to one person and the only non-brethren person in my team is me and Carol. She was lovely, really good to me, she was. And like brethren members of staff would come in and they would ask Carol, Carol's sitting across from me, sort of three metres away, her desk. They'd ask Carol a question that I needed to answer. I'd give Carol the answer and she'd repeat it to them. And they're standing in the door two metres from me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5233s)

Come on, that's not, yeah, that's just, I mean, you think of that from Carol's perspective, a normal non-brethren person and she's sitting there, we can go between, she must be thinking, who are these people?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5247s)

Oh, she knows why, she, she got to know very quickly, yeah. She, yeah, honestly, she's amazing, she was like, she's an angel to me, she was like, yeah. Because they, yeah, you see, not only that, I was trying to be professional at work, but I'd lost all, they had no respect for me or any respect any of them ever had for me was gone because I was, nothing to do with whether I was good or bad at work, it was because I was withdrawn from the brethren.

To the point that the day I was withdrawn from, I think I walked in, there was about, we had an all-staff meeting, there was about 30 brethren working there and a [similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5293s) number of non-brethren. One of the non-brethren, I said, "What's happened to Murray?" Something's clearly, like they noticed that I was being shunned, yeah, yeah.

And so anyway, they came, they kept going for six months and I was feeling more and more stress, more and more angry, but I didn't dare show my anger because it would be viewed as a step back, you know, like a regression. And then one day, they played a bit of a, a bit of a nasty trick and they brought along an older brother who I, who I actually really respected and they knew I really respected him.

They knew I had a, he was different, he was very much raw, a bit controversial, could be a bit cantankerous and but he would stand his ground, if he knew what was right, he would stand his ground. And you know, you could quote Bruce Hales at him till you're blue in the face, "Scripture says," and he would put himself, but he was clever enough not to cross the lines, get himself, but he would stand by the truth rather than the Chinese [whispers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5368s) that come down from Sydney.

And they brought him along, knowing that he might be a bit quite effective on me. And anyway, I was, I'd had enough by this time, I was burnt out and I was done. And we're sitting there and there was one of the elders was a bully, very vocal, and he was just, he was just a bully to anybody and everybody he came across. And his brother was a yes-man and I actually had more respect for the bully than I [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5405s) for his brother because at least the bully, at least you knew where you stood with the bully. The yes-man, he just had, he was spineless, he was just like, he'd literally say, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes," and he'd be like, whichever way the wind was blowing, he'd agree with it.

And so I sat there, they asked me what progress I've made and I was holding everything together and I said to this brother, "So-and-so, can I ask you a question?" And he's like, "Yes, yes, yes, of course you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5435s), of course you can, yes, yes, yes." I said, "I'd like you to tell me about the time when you came to the end of yourself and you knew that the Lord had come in and taken up your case and you were never going to sin again. Can you just tell me about your experience when that happened for you?"

And he sat there and he sat and he said, "Well, I don't know if I can, I mean, that's a, well, that's a very difficult, yeah, very difficult question, Murray, I don't know the answer to that." And I stood up and I said, "Well, how the do you expect to get me there then?"

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5477s)

They were your words?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5478s)

They were my words, yeah. Every jaw in the room just went, "What did he just say?" But the point was, I'd had enough, I was going nowhere.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5492s)

Yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5492s)

I've done six months, I've ticked every box, I've done everything you'd ask. Yeah, yeah, I'm human, I'm not, yeah, I am never going to be, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5503s)

So was that the actual tipping point for you, that particular visit, or?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5508s)

That visit, that was kind of, I said, "You might as well leave now," and they all went. One brother sort of stayed, he said, "Murray, don't give up." I said, "No, I'm finished, you know." Yeah, and I kind of kept it all together for a few more months because obviously I was trying to get myself into gear and get my work out, what, I didn't know what the future looked like. There's still the reality of losing everything, the reality of my children going.

And I went into work one morning and it was a Friday morning, I went in at half past seven, I sat down at my desk and I just bawled my eyes out. I just cried, I couldn't, I couldn't explain why, apart from I was completely burnt out and I could not help myself. And Carol said to me, she said, "Murray, go and sit in the car," she said, "I'll hold the fort there." So I went and sat in the car, sort of try and get myself together.

And about half an hour later, she came out, she says, "How are you feeling?" I said, "Yeah, I'll be fine, I'll come in in a bit." She said to me, she said, "You need to go and see a doctor." And I said, "No, no, I'll be fine, I mean, okay." She said, "Murray, you need to go and see a doctor." And I said, "No," I said, "Carol, I can't, you know, I'll be, let me just..." She said, "Murray, you need to go and see a doctor, don't come back in," I said, "I'll hold the fort, if anyone asks me, I'll tell them that you've gone out, whatever, I'll make sure, keep it, you go and see."

So I said, "Okay," phoned the doctor, went to see the doctor and told him everything, you know, told him what was going on and he asked me a long list of questions and he said, "Murray," he said, "I'm signing you off with severe anxiety and depression, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5611s) in no fit state to function at work." And I was like, "Well, what does this mean?" Because, you know, I can't, sick pay is not going to pay my mortgage and, you know, how's everything going to happen?

And he said, "No," he said, "I cannot," he said, "I'll be negligent of my duty to let you go without giving you, signing you off." So I handed in this sick note and went home, sort of processing the reality of it all. About an hour or so later, I got a phone call from one [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5646s) the elders and he said, "Uh, Murray, we understand you've been to see the doctor, we'd like to come and see you, make sure everything's okay." So I was like, "Okay, fair enough, it's inevitable this is going to happen." Two of them turn up, first question they asked me was, "Why didn't you tell anyone you were going to the doctors?"

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5666s)

Oh, dear God.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5671s)

Well, I just, I did, Carol knew I was going to the doctor. "Yes, but you never told any, you know, you should have told someone you're going to the doctor." "Why? I'm a 37, 38-year-old bloke now."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5685s)

But things like that's a confidential...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5687s)

Yeah, I dealt with my professional duties as in, you know, yeah, knew where I was and it wasn't like I disappeared off the face of the earth. In a management position, I came and went quite a bit anyway, you know, it wasn't, although pretty much every move I made was tracked, but that's another story.

So anyway, that was their first question, I was like, okay, we'll deal with that. Second question, "Obviously, what we'd like to know, we're just concerned what you may have told the doctor that would bring the testimony into disrepute."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5725s)

And that's the absolute truth of why they don't like the brethren going to the doctor, isn't it? And that's the truth of why they like, if you do go to the doctor, they like someone to go with you.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5734s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5735s)

That's just, that's just so telling, isn't it? It's, yeah, it...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5740s)

It was like scales fell from my eyes. This was like, that is the bottom line. You've got, you're looking at someone who a few weeks before, I'd had too much to drink, something happened and I then ended up driving across the causeway at Pitsford at 120 miles an hour, thinking if I lose control and hit a tree, I don't give a shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that was, that was my thought and then all you're worried about is what I told the doctor.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5778s)

Yeah, because they want to be in control of the narrative, don't they?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5781s)

Yeah, absolutely right. But I think the whole thing that was disconcerting for me, I hadn't been caught or found out doing something I shouldn't do. I'd put my hand up and said, "I'm in trouble." Yeah. Luke 15, the prodigal son, is one of the most preached scriptures in the brethren, or it certainly was up to when I left.

Anybody and everybody could give you an acceptable preaching on Luke 15\. The younger son takes everything, his father's inheritance from his father, goes to a far country, has a great time, does everything he wants to do, blows all the money, realize he's sinned, realize he's done wrong, goes back to his father's house in repentance and the father rushes out, receives him, back into his house, puts him... I mean, he said he'd go back and be a servant and the father restored him to the highest order in the house. He'd been lost and he was found, he'd come back. I was lost, I put my hand up in brethren terms, I was lost.

I put my hand up, said, "I'm in trouble," and all that actually happened over a two-year period was I got pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed, yeah. And how much of that, how much of that came down to your surname? Oh yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5865s)

Yeah, yeah, it's...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5868s)

An interesting point, Gilli. One brother said to me once, when I'd suggested I might move to Albrook because I didn't like it in Northampton, I was fed up of the, and this brother said to me, he said, "Oh, you can't go there, we've got too many projects, we need you for..." Okay, yeah, you just want me to do projects for you, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5890s)

Yeah, yeah, that's how demeaning is that? Totally. So after you left, Murray, I know that obviously you didn't see your children for a bit and then you did try to see your children, didn't you? Yeah, what happened there?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5906s)

Yeah, so what happened there? So I just want to say that the point where I finally made a decision that I'm leaving, I am leaving, the day I made that decision, up until that point, it was really hard emotionally, but the day I made that decision, it was like a massive weight fell off my shoulders. Yeah, you then start the process of separating officially and obviously there are my children.

And I said, I set out from the start with a genuine intention to not make it any more difficult than it has to be. So I asked if I could see them and they said no. I said, "I just want to say hello to them, just give me..." "No, no, no."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5952s)

And your children at that time?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5954s)

Yeah, they were, so they would have been 13, 6 and 3\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5965s)

Okay, so quite young, yeah, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=5968s)

Yeah. And it was really, and they were, they were putting up every barrier and it's very clever what they do because I was dealing with my wife. So from a legal perspective, it was a dispute between a husband and wife, you know, yeah, yeah. But the truth of it, the reality of it is that behind her, there's a committee, there's a whole institution that's dictating what she does and doesn't do.

And as soon as you want to put that into a legal field, it's, "Well, it's between..." and they'll stand back and say, "Well, it's between Murray and his wife," you know, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6011s)

Church doesn't get involved, it's a marital thing.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6013s)

Exactly, yeah, "Everyone's free to make their own decisions." Like heck you flipping are, yeah, yeah. And so I, and it wasn't until you gave me that copy, Jacky, of the, I forget what it's called, the Charities Commission, Faith in Practice...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6030s)

Document that I get on my soapbox about.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6032s)

Yeah, yeah, well, and I put that to them and I sent that as an email to my wife and I pointed out, I said, "Look, this Charities Commission thing has not gone away," because that was a really scary time for the brethren, yeah, yeah, because if they'd lost their charitable status, they would have owed billions of pounds because it would all be backdated to who knows when. And that was a real tough fight and it was, it was quite stressful actually for everybody in the church.

So I played on that to a degree and not wrongly, I said, "Look, it hasn't gone away." I said, "All I'm asking for you is for you to be reasonable. I'm not going to ask the children to do anything they're not comfortable with, I'm not going to force them to do anything they don't want to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6084s), all I want to do is spend time with them." And as a result of that, I got a regular, I would say every six to eight weeks, I had to send an email. I tried to do it more regularly at the start, but it just met with a lot of resistance and it settled down, six to eight weeks was reasonable, they would, they would run with it, so I ran with that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6114s)

So just to clarify a little bit, the clause that was actually kind of used, I can't quote the wording off the top of my head, but it was the brethren agreed in all their trustees with the Charity Commission, because one of the concerns was the harm they caused over splitting up families and keeping children from parents that left. They agreed that they would make every effort, something, all reasonable steps would be taken to allow the continuation of relationships with family members that [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6144s) left, especially where children are involved and the wording is something like that.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6148s)

Correct, and that...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6149s)

Was what you, you sort of quoted to them, wasn't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6152s)

That was what I used. And yeah, and I made it quite clear that it hasn't gone away, there is, there's rumblings because the stuff I found out since I left, you know, I never knew there were so many ex-brethren around, yeah, I never knew that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6167s)

They just kind of evaporate when they leave and you never know about them when you're in, do they, exactly.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6173s)

And I think, I think in Northampton, there was a brother left with his family about 35 years ago, yeah, who I'm actually now really good friends with. And then there was me, 30, 35 odd years later, Northampton. Anyone who knows Northampton is a funny place. We had, there's a very self-righteous arrogance, you know, almost a pride that, you know, we haven't lost anybody, you know, in Northampton and we're almost a holier than thou.

And yeah, the standards of the competition between families and households was just ridiculous and I, I attempted to keep up with it, you know, I did. And I was saying to Ross earlier, we spoke before, you know, I did things and thought [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6227s) about people that I'm ashamed of, but actually what was driving it was my desire to be accepted.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6235s)

Yeah, we've all been there.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6237s)

My desire to fit in in this world that I didn't fit into. Yeah, but fast forwarding, Jacky, on your question with the children, that worked very well until just two weeks ago. That's right, so my divorce got finalized, well, we're waiting for the decree absolute to actually be, you know, we signed for it, but waiting for it to actually, the court to sign it off.

But I received an [email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6273s) from my ex-wife on what would have been our 20th wedding anniversary in February, basically saying when this is signed off, they've paid me all the way, we don't expect you to turn up unannounced at the house because sometimes I would turn up on their birthdays, I'd just turn up, knock on the door and give them some birthday presents.

And they were often the best times to, because you got them off guard, they weren't prepared. And I had some of the best conversations with my children then. Whereas officially when I was seeing them every six to eight weeks, my dad would come along and we'd meet at the park and we'd go for, and they're all, they've probably had an early morning prayer meeting for all I know and praying for these children that had to go and see their father who's in the world.

So the kids were there would have just been on their guard all the time. She said, "You know, I wouldn't want you to just turn up and wouldn't expect you to turn up anymore, it's not your house anymore." And [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6336s) know, and then, so I thought, okay, that's kind of understandable, I no longer own anything there, but they're still my children there. So I sent her an email saying, "I understand your, I understand that, I respect your wishes and providing you're, something like, you providing you're reasonable about, you know, don't make it unreasonably difficult for me to see the children, I will continue to respect your wishes."

Basically saying, "Yeah, I'll play ball if you play ball." And then I asked, I put in a request saying I'd like to see the children and I got no reply, no reply. And then eventually I got an email from her email, so I've got no, I haven't got my children's phone numbers, I've got no way of contacting my children electronically. But she told me on good faith, she said the children normally see your emails before I do, it's a family email and everyone's, so you know.

I got an email that was from my son saying, "Basically, thanks for your email, Dad, I don't want to see you anymore. And you've chosen your life and the things you want to do and share with me, we could never fit, they could never work." And Talitha, so my middle daughter, my daughter, she doesn't want to see you at the moment either.

Now the problem is, the younger two have always said that they only want to see me if Levi, the older one, comes with them, which was fine. And I realize now, I think I've been, I [realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6450s) I've been played. Because Levi's 19, he can do what he wants, yeah, I've got absolutely no, if I wanted to go legal, I might as well just, 20 grand, you know, yeah, you've got nothing, you've got nothing, one to six things. But the problem is, I've accepted that the other two come with Levi, that's how it works.

So it becomes, so I'm in this situation at the moment is, what do I do? How do I, the one thing it does play out for me and I'd like to point this out, because I didn't really come on here to tell my sob story of, you know, feel sorry for me and this, more to the point is that in moving into the big wide world, everyone tells you and they're absolutely right, is that your children will leave you.

So if you're fighting to stay in a relationship you're not happy in, in a world that you're not happy in for the sake of your children, just bear in mind, and this comes from someone who has three children who I absolutely love and would do anything I could for them. And if they turn their back on me and don't come to me for 20 years, I'll still be there for them.

But they will get to an age [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6541s) they will leave home, they will, they don't, they won't, like my son, he's 19, he doesn't want it, he's decided he doesn't want anything to do with me. I would have written the same letter at his age if my dad had left and I was 19\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6556s)

Yeah, because he will be respected for making a stand.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6557s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6560s)

And also, it will buy him acceptance into the community he happens to be in, won't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6566s)

Correct, correct.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6568s)

And so you could argue, he says, "I don't want to see you." But who's, I don't mean this disrespectfully towards your son, which puppet's pulling his strings? It's the puppet of the community he's been born into.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6581s)

Exactly. And the stigma of having a father who's out of the end of the end. The fact that he's taken his own stand, that would be a big tick in his eyes, it would work in his favour and he would genuinely believe he's doing the right thing.

But the point I was going to make is that I've got three children, those three children will leave home. You know, Levi, Zadok, the youngest, he will be, he's eight now, so 10, 12 years' time, I'm going to be, I'm going to be 55 and he's going to leave home. You know, he'll go and get married and they'll be gone and I'll be left, you'll be left living in a loveless [relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6630s) with no family, yeah, you know.

Yeah, they're right. So whilst it is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with and Anne, I think you'll relate to this, is you have to process it and I don't know how others do it, but I do tend to focus on what I can change and yeah, what I can't change, I just put up to one side and yeah, it comes out at times. I think, yeah, the reality of life is why spend another 15, 20 years of misery to be so much older that it's so much harder?

Yeah, well, I should have left when I was 19, I didn't leave till I was 37, 38\. And then part of me looks, it said if I'd left at 19, I wouldn't have put three children through all that trauma. But then the flip side of that is there's three lovely souls on this earth and you've been, you've been chosen to be where you are. Yeah, it's not, and it's like myself, flip, we tried so hard to fit in and we just didn't fit in.

So I don't know why I didn't fit in, but you are now a beacon of light to your children. But also, if you think about it, if you'd stay, well, I know if I'd stayed, I wouldn't be here, but if you'd stayed, what use would you be to your children in that state anyway? Exactly, yeah. That often uses, Dan often uses the analogy of on the airplane, they tell you who's the first person has to put an oxygen mask on before you help a child. If you haven't got your oxygen mask on and you aren't looking after yourself, you haven't got a hope of helping anybody else.

And [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6749s), it just helps when you realize that, yeah. And that, that's helpful. And the most, I say the most honest thing I've ever done in my life was actually standing up and admitting to myself and everybody else that I don't belong in there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6764s)

Yeah, yeah. Because up until that point, if you look at it...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6770s)

Carry on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6771s)

No, no, go on, up until that point...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6777s)

Up until that point, everything I did was a lie. You know, I was demonstrating one thing and doing something else, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's another thing, yeah, that's another thing is that for the first time ever, you're actually doing what you told everybody you're going to do. You're actually being honest, you're actually being true and your children will see that. They mightn't see it now, but eventually our children will realize, "Mom stuck to what she was doing, Dad stuck to what he was doing, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6811s) I can trust them, I know they're not going to change their minds, the rules aren't going to change because they stuck on that path."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6818s)

Yeah, and I think that's part of, in a way, I mean, I've not been in the situation that you, Murray, or Ann have been in, but part of the way of coping with it when it gets to the point where the children are, I will use the word coerced, to turn around and write emails like that and like the letter you got from your daughter. Once it gets to that point, there's not a lot you can do except, and I'm trying to look for the positive in the negative, to say, "This is where I am, my love for you will never change and you will always come, you can always contact me."

And should that scenario ever happen, as you rightly point out, they're then going to a parent who's probably far more stable in themselves than the parent they might have had, had their parents stayed together in the brethren.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6868s)

Absolutely, exactly. One simple thing at that point in their lives, so whenever I do see them, whenever I contact them, they have a card with a little gift in it, my phone number and my address. Yeah, yeah, I don't know if they're allowed to keep it, I don't know if they do keep it. So every time I do that, but the point is, if they come to me tomorrow or in 10 years' time, they're coming to a parent who is not going to judge them, whatever they have done.

Yeah, whereas when I was in the brethren, I would have judged them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6904s)

Yes, you'd have to have done, if they had done something wrong in brethren eyes, you'd had to judge them.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6909s)

Whatever it was, they could tell me the worst thing in the world, I don't care what it is, and I would not judge them for it. And I'd love them to know that and believe that. But also, something like, I'm conscious we're running away on time, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6925s)

As we often do, we try not to, but it's just so fascinating, it happens.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6932s)

I just want to talk about my experience leaving the church and I found this helpful, it doesn't necessarily work for everybody. But to be fair, what inspired me was to actually come forward and do this. Obviously, you know, Gilli, you told your story, Ross, you told your story and you come from it from different perspectives. So I was saying to Ross earlier, I'm 99% certain that there are more gay people in the brethren that's really struggling. So Ross speaking out…

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6960s)

…and people are gay, so statistically so.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=6964s)

Exactly, so that if they can see that and I thought, well, okay, there must be people in the church that had similar struggles to me. However I am, one thing I found really helpful and I made a point when I left, when I first left, of not getting too involved with lots of ex-brethren members. And my reason for that was I didn't want to surround myself with people where the only thing we had in common is we'd all come from this strange cult.

And that was the only need and so therefore we almost become a, you almost become a splinter group, yeah. And I understand that for some people, that might be what you need. I mean, I actually make friends very easily, I don't struggle to make friends. But I know for some people, it's nice to have familiarity. But I found for myself, I think there's one ex-brethren member who I do have a lot to do with and our relationship is based purely on a genuine friendship rather than, of course, when we get together, we have jokes about things that used to go on and we talk about, but I just found that for myself really helpful to build my own set of friends for its own, for their own merits.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7057s)

Yeah, I think that's really good advice, Murray. I mean, I personally didn't have much to do with ex-brethren, apart from my husband, for about 25 years. And it was for that reason. And I think that's something perhaps to point out, if anybody inside is listening, ex-brethren totally have that in common. We've all got that common and rather peculiar background. But also, we're all individuals and we all have different personalities. And there'll be some ex-brethren you get on well with and some you don't get on so well with and that is quite okay, isn't it? That's quite okay, that's life.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7090s)

But that is actually people, it's people, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7093s)

It's life.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7094s)

Yeah, I go to a pub, I get on really well with some people, yeah, I tolerate other people and I just ignore others.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7102s)

Yeah, and that's my choice, yeah, but you can make that choice. Yeah, and that's, I think that's the difference between when you're in the brethren. The brethren are, at the end of the day, human beings with different personalities, just like the rest of us. Therefore, some of the brethren will get on and some of the brethren won't get on, but you are supposed to get on, you're supposed to all be, so you end up sometimes being this incredibly false situation whereby there's some personalities in the brethren you [genuinely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7132s) get on with and some you don't and maybe you don't like very much, but you still are supposed to be their brother, their sister and love them, whereas out here, you don't have to mix with those personalities, exactly.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7143s)

And I think the point that's worth making is that it's not so much whether you decide you want to get on with someone or not, it's the, it's the mental, the psychological pressure of being forced to get on with people that you just don't click with.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7158s)

Yeah, nothing in common with.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7160s)

Yeah, I remember, you know, you'd understand the entertaining and you'd be given, you'd be allocated sort of three, three or five families, yeah. And I remember we'd look at this list on Thursday night we were given and they're like, "Who have we got?" And it'd be like, "This is going to be hard work."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7175s)

Yeah, yeah, or that'll be a good evening, this is going to be a real good bash.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7179s)

And then it gets changed at the last minute, you'll be like, flipping it. But yeah, you know, I was very much, you know, I was one of these people, if you came to my house, I think this came from my dad to be honest with you, if you came to my house from whoever you were, from the moment you walked through the door to the moment you left, I will give you my best. I'll give you everything. However, sometimes it was really, really, really hard.

You know, you'd have a lounge full of, I mean, latterly we had quite a reasonable size lounge and we'd get like 20 or nearly 30 people in there sometimes. And when you walk into a room full of 30 people and nobody's saying anything...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7216s)

Oh no, I remember painful doing here, yeah, what is this about? Flashback, yeah, it does me, yeah, and I left yonks years ago, but it was no different, it's that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7230s)

And not only, not only that, it's costing me flipping nearly a grand to feed you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7234s)

That's the real insult, isn't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7238s)

Yeah, at least make it easy for me to entertain, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7240s)

Yeah, at least let's have a bit of a laugh. Yes, it's no wonder they all have double scotches at 11 o'clock in the morning.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7245s)

Oh, exactly. Well, that's the only way you got going, was just give him a little more alcohol, yeah. But yeah, that's a point that I've found really helpful. And the other thing is, like everybody said, we've all found somebody, I've found people, they say, 

"Oh, there's nobody like the brethren in the world, nobody cares about you, nobody does anything."

Like Steven Gear was saying, you know, I had a job go wrong, massively wrong for me in business last year, struggled with cash [flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7276s), struggled with labor. And there was someone who I was acquainted with, who I knew had a lot of money and I phoned him up and said, "Look," I mean, I knew him from my days when I worked for the, in a brethren company and he lent me a big chunk of money completely on trust. He said, "I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna charge you any interest." He said, "If you want to make a little gift at the end, it's up to you, but there's no pressure, pay it back when you can."

And I paid [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7306s) back and I paid him a little bit extra as well and he said, "I'll put that in the coffers." He said, "I'll put that to the Lord's work," or something, you know, he's a Christian, he's a lovely guy, but he didn't, the only, he only knew me from dealings he'd had with me in business.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7322s)

Yeah, so like I said to you before, Murray, you know, I was in, obviously I was in the Priory and a beloved brother from your, from Northampton, lent about five grand and he said, "This needs to be paid back within a certain amount of time or else we'll start charging you interest."

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7338s)

Yeah, and that was, but this was, there was nothing, it was this, that's the difference. And they'll tell you, and I believe that you are on your own and to a degree, you are on your own. Life is, is reality, you have to fight your own battles, you have to take your own stand. But the point I'm making is there are decent people out there.

And there was another guy who has, who'd been working with me and he's actually my, a really good friend of mine. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7369s) he phoned me up, I never, I said, all the guys, I said, "Look guys, I cannot afford to pay you another day, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to let you go, I'll pay you all the money that, I will pay you the money you're owed." And about two or three days later, he phoned me up, he said, "Murray," so, "I've got an offer for you." He says, "I will give you a week's work for 20 quid a day just to cover my fuel."

Yeah, well, he effectively gave me over a thousand pounds as a gift and he came along, free labor, he came and he did that for me. Plus, I owed him a big chunk of money and he said, "Just pay me that when you can." Now that was a situation that I was struggling, you know, I've got myself into a situation, I needed help and people came out of the woodwork to help me.

And there be, and and it was quite an interesting thing when I paid him back. So this guy, Mark, and his brother, his brother said to me, he said, "Oh," he said, "I asked Mark if he'd ever doubted that I'd pay him the money back." And I felt, I found myself thinking, why would he doubt me? That's my, you know, because I've grown up in this, you know, you trust everybody around you, why would it even... I thought, part of me was a bit offended, so what have I done to make you think I might not pay it back? That's when I suddenly realized that that's reality.

You know, to be fair, he didn't know whether I would ever pay him. No, the truth is I have, but he didn't know, I could still owe that money now and yes, it's going to come, it's going to come. But it just, there, there's massive, the stark differences between the world I grew up in, we grew up in and the world we live in now. But the truth is, there are people out here who care. There are people, most, 90% of people, whether they claim to be spiritualists, atheists, Muslims, Jews, Catholics, whatever [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7499s) claim, most people are decent and they've got basic Christian ethics. Care for one another, look out for each other, help people, like human beings, just be a human, you know. They've got morals. I've got a really eclectic bunch of friends. And part of me would love to go to a preaching with them one day and just take them, march them all in there and just sit, sit them on the back row.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7530s)

Well, it's a place of public religious worship, there's no reason why you can't, Murray.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7534s)

Exactly, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7536s)

Anyway, yeah.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7538s)

I think some of them potentially would shrivel up if you poured holy water on them, but the point is, I know that I could phone them at two o'clock tomorrow morning, so I'm in the shit and they would say "You're a complete dick, I’ll come and help you.”

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7554s)

And, and I think the big thing is, it's a circle of friends that accept you just the way you are, exactly. That's the key thing, isn't it, for all of us, the key thing, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I was just going to say, we've actually been going about two hours, which is, and I could keep going for another hour, yeah. I think we ought to perhaps have, yeah, have some care for our listeners who, yeah.

But Murray, really appreciate you coming on and I think it's fantastic. I think the story about what happened with your children will resonate with many and, but also the way you felt when you were leaving compared to the way you feel now and it's the same for all [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7603s) us, I think, but the way you describe it is, I hope will be inspirational, particularly to anyone inside who listens. Yeah, the freedom's priceless, isn't it?

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7612s)

It is and I think, and it's not wrong, it's not wrong. You won't shrivel up, you won't be struck by lightning.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7618s)

No, it's not a dark place out here, that's...

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7621s)

Not a dark place. God created this world out here as well as the world in there, yeah, yeah, or whatever belief you want to put on it, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7629s)

Well, thank you so much, Murray, really, really appreciate you telling your story. I know it always costs people to tell the raw truth, but I think it's helpful, I really, really do. Thank you, Murray.

### [**Murray Chattell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7641s)

Good to chat.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADsX1zpIZE&t=7642s)

Thank you, it's a chat.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
