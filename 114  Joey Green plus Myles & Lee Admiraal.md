## Summary

What a story this is! Born into an intensely homophobic and misogynist cult, Joey Green comes to the realization that she is a lesbian – and to make a bad situation worse, her father is an outspoken anti-gay activist. Joey was on episode 93 as anonymous and came back as herself to fill in many parts of her story she wasn't able to fill in before. One of those stories, along with many others, is alcohol in water bottles at school!
Growing up in the isolationist Plymouth Brethren Christian Church cult, where women are treated as inferiors and homosexuality is actively hated, a young girl overcomes all these barriers to become the happy and confident non-binary personality that we see and hear on this podcast – a sparkling witness to the transformation that takes place when a person breaks free and can live their true identity.
We then take a look at Myles and Lee Admiraal, prominent and extremely wealthy PBCC business owners who have a dark history of homophobic hatred and harassment, leading to a damning court case in Montreal. This revealing court case really shows how these children take the leaders' hatred and then act them out in society. Ben discusses a horrifying field trip that also ended in physical hatred towards the LGBTQ community.
To finish off, we have Bruce Thompson’ performing his latest song “Top of the Tree” a reflection on the wealth and power of the Exclusive Brethren’s “Man of God”. Bruce's music is really resonating and bringing solace to many ex-members.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

Trigger warning. Discussion on sexual harassment. Viewer discretion is advised.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=57s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get a Life Podcast: Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl, an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and today joining me is Ben Woodbury from Australia, and Craig Hoyle from New Zealand, who are also both ex-members. Today we have a special guest returning. Although her first time on here she had to remain anonymous, Joey Green is also an ex-member who left more recently. She left just [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=93s) a year ago, and her first podcast was podcast number 93 if you want to catch up with that one before this one.

Today, Joey is going to expand on her journey inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and we are also going to talk about a court case that Lee and Myles Admiraal were involved in. Thank you, Joey, for joining us again. I know you couldn't give your full story last time, and now things have changed, we're excited to hear the rest of your journey. So I am going to pass it over to you and let [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=123s) get started.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=126s)

Thank you. So I identify as non-binary, so I go by she/they pronouns. I'm from what they call the Vancouver locality, it's actually located in Langley now. We moved out of Vancouver in 2008 because the pricing was going up for houses and everything like that. So we moved to Langley. And my parents [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=156s) Curtis and Nikki Green from Langley.

But yeah, I guess I wanted to get started with the guilt and the signs side of things.

So about probably three years ago now, maybe just a bit more, there was a little one who passed away in Vancouver and everyone started preaching that this was a sign to us. I was at this point really, really struggling with my internalized homophobia, and I was reading lesbian romance novels and taking "Am I gay?" quizzes on my phone. I saw this incident as a sign that God was punishing [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=200s) the people in Vancouver because I was gay. I felt really, really horribly about this for the longest time because I was convinced that my homosexuality was the cause of this accident and this little boy's passing.

And after that, I kind of felt like I had a glowing sign above my head telling everyone I was gay and that he was gone because I just couldn't be attracted to men and be normal. I felt really horribly for the family, but also to the people who preached about it being a sign. I don't believe in signs anymore, and I can't begin to tell you the guilt that that kind of preaching [puts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=247s) on people's shoulders. It almost drives you away from believing in God and the church and everything like that.

Yeah, it's just really not a nice feeling to have people telling you that things are signs and then you internalize that and put a lot of blame on yourself for it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=268s)

Yeah, and that's a really big thing inside, isn't it? It's huge. Everything, when something goes wrong, it's somebody in the locality that's done something, right? And it 100% is a backpack you wear, especially if you were the person that is either hiding from something or is a family that's being exploited. So yeah, it is a horrible, horrible feeling.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=290s)

Last time I was on, I spoke about a letter I wrote to my parents right before I left. But I also want to touch on a letter I wrote about three years ago now, I think. That was my coming out letter. I don't actually have a copy of it, and I don't remember what I said, but the circumstances around it are a huge part of my journey. So I just want to touch on that. One Friday night, I stayed home from a dinner invite. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=320s) at this point, I was really struggling with my anxiety and depression. I was super easily overstimulated and overwhelmed. So, you know, the Friday nights were always loud music and a lot of chatter. I usually just sat in the corner and left early because I got overwhelmed and started having anxiety attacks.

But I had figured out a way around the streamline internet protection. And so I spent my evening reading a book.

I think it was a lesbian romance novel or something like that. And my parents had an internet service that showed the usage on each device. So when they got home that evening, they confronted me about having been on my phone all evening. I started off trying to deny it, and when that didn't work, I ended up convincing them to just leave it be for that evening, and I'd explain the next morning.

Anyway, over that night, I stayed up and wrote them a letter.

I kind of felt like I was in a corner and it was my only choice to come out to them. I don't remember exactly what I wrote, but I remember having to write around tears that were falling on the page. I was super scared because I was admitting to the one thing that I was really ashamed of and that was really affecting me the most at the moment. And when I finished, I left it on my bedside table. The next morning, my mom woke me [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=416s) and asked if I wanted her to take the note to my dad. So I told her yes and just went back to sleep. I didn't talk to my dad for the rest of the day, but my mom came back later in tears. She walked in and just gave me a massive hug and apologized that I had to go through everything alone. I'm really thankful for that compassion there.

Didn't necessarily turn out great later on, but I'm super thankful for that moment there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=445s)

And did your dad, how did he respond to it after that? Did he ever come and talk to you?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=451s)

I'm not, I don't really remember ever having a specific conversation about it really. It was just kind of something we avoided. We talked about it quite a bit later when it became an obvious issue again, but yeah, I don't recall having a conversation at that time about it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=472s)

And what was their general view of it? Was their approach, "This is something we can work through, this is something that can be cured, can be fixed?" Or were they genuinely curious as to how you felt, why you felt?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=487s)

I think in that letter I told them that it wasn't a choice I would make because obviously I wanted to stay with my family and everything. But they told me that they could get me help and it could be fixed and it would all be better, sort of thing, as long as I did what I was told.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=507s)

Were you aware at that point of how the Brethren had tried to help other gay people?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=515s)

I think the most I'd heard about it was that they had given someone medication for it, which I wasn't aware of who at the time or what exactly. And I think we had a few people in our area who had also overcome, and I at that point was really just hoping that I could be fixed and return to living a normal life. [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=546s)

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=546s)

And just out of curiosity, was it men you heard about or women? Because when I was in there, I never thought women were gay, to be honest. Although I did understand what a lesbian was, I never thought that Brethren women... and obviously Brethren women, I feel like in general, can get away with a lot more. So it's kind of, you know, I guess if you have your babies and go back to life, you can kind of put it aside. Not dismissing at all how toxic and horrific a journey it must be. [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=577s) I do feel like it's much easier to hide a butch sort of woman within the community than it is a flamboyant gay guy. That's what I think is why I never really thought of it. I just thought it was normal that there weren't women that were... so did you ever hear of women that overcame, I guess?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=598s)

I didn't really ever hear of women who were fixed or however they like to put it. It was mostly just men, yeah. Later on, I heard vague mumblings about women who had gone on to live normal lives with their families and whatnot, but I didn't really know anything of it at the time when I came out.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=629s)

I guess a lot of that then would have been regional as well because I'd look back at, you know, women and girls I knew that were butch-presenting, but a lot of them were from rural communities or came from farming families where it was pretty common for girls to be out there running machinery and gutting sheep and all that kind of stuff. And so I think it was fine for the females to cross over into that male territory, but never the other way around.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=657s)

Yeah, gender roles were very, can you say, laid down as a law. And that's what I mean by women seem to get away with a little bit more. Yeah.

How isolating though for you. I think about how isolating it was for me and for other gay men that I've helped leave, but I can't even imagine how isolating for you. Some of, you know, we had people to look to. Like I knew that Craig had left and was, you know, appearing to live a good and happy life, you know, from what you can see from the outside. And same with other people like Matt Cook and that. I can only imagine how isolating it would have been for you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=702s)

And there needs to be more lesbians come out and write books. That's what you can do, Joey.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=708s)

We'll just start with sharing this story.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=713s)

Yeah, so the next thing I kind of want to touch on is the homophobia and the SOGI movement in our area.

From what I can remember, I attended kindergarten for one day before my parents found out that my teacher was a lesbian and pulled me from that school. So I ended up going to that school for one day and then I was switched to a French immersion school after that. I'm not sure the exact reasoning behind it, but the one memory I have from that day was that my teacher read *A Kissing Hand for Chester Raccoon*, which is a story about a mother raccoon who kisses her kid's hand and then tells him that he can open it and put it on his face throughout the day if he ever misses her, I believe, or something along those lines. So it was clearly detrimental to my mental well-being having her read that to me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=771s)

Heaven forbid you know about a mother's love, a genuine mother's love.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=778s)

I grew up in the Bible Belt in the Fraser Valley. For those who aren't familiar, that basically means that the city I live in and the ones around it are fairly religious.

Christians and other religions are quite prominent around here. There's a lot of churches and whatnot, but recently they're catching up with the times a little bit more. In 2017, there was a lot of protesting for and against the SOGI movement, which according to their website, the goal of their program is to help educators make schools inclusive and safe for students of all sexual orientations and gender identities. [At](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=822s) a SOGI-inclusive school, students' gender does not limit their interests and opportunities, and their sexual orientation and how they understand and express their gender are welcome without discrimination.

Obviously, the Brethren are anti-SOGI and my dad was quite involved in that. He said at one point, I believe, that his children might not have the maturity to handle this most personal and most sensitive topic, which, I was buried deep in the closet at the point that he said that, so I think I might have had the maturity to handle that.

But I know last time we had talked about how homophobia seemed to always come up at family gatherings and whatnot, and I get how it might have seemed like it more, especially because I was in the closet, but also my dad was quite involved in this stuff, so it was definitely coming up a fair bit in relation to his protesting that he did.

And then there's one lady who ran for councilor or something like that in our area who the Brethren supported, and she was really opposed to a recent bill in British Columbia that would ban conversion therapy.

And she made this a part of her campaign, that she would keep conversion therapy around. Thankfully that bill passed anyway, so conversion therapy is illegal in Canada now, but she was quite sure that it shouldn't be because people can get fixed or something.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=930s)

Sounds like a self-projection.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=936s)

What was that like having your dad be a part of the protesting and stuff like that?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=946s)

I mean, on the surface, I was kind of behind it. Like I would say things that aligned with his views and whatnot, but at the same time, I was kind of like, "Well, I guess I could never come out and never be myself because clearly he doesn't like that." So it was kind of isolating as well and just fairly hurtful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=974s)

And I mean, I know you've talked about this before, Ben, where you were very homophobic yourself when you were inside, right? Where you don't have a choice.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=983s)

Yeah, yeah, definitely. You think, you know, it's kind of like believe the lie, you become part of the lie, you know, it disappears. Bury your head in the sand, but it doesn't go away, obviously. But yeah, I can't imagine how, like, it's already hurtful enough to, I think, like I said last time we were on this chat, Joey, you are hyper-aware that you are gay. So you are overly sensitive [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1013s) anything in terms of anything that could at all allude to the fact that you're gay. So you often overhear conversations about it. Your ears are always on constant alert for the term gay or anything related to it. I can only imagine how much more the injury would be if you had somebody that was a family member that actively campaigned [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1043s) it. Like I often think about the doctor that prescribed you medication and was trying to fix you, Craig, and I often think that his own family members are gay. I can only imagine how much the injury would be, like how toxic that behavior is.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1068s)

You just end up living your life in a permanent defensive crouch. Like that fight or flight, you're just listening to everything because you never know when you're going to have to jump.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1077s)

And I mean, if you've listened to podcast 112 with Matthew, he talks about it in there, where he was, they had told him when he had asked about certain things and he'd asked about, Craig's name got brought up and the chemical castration, and they told him, "Well, he chose it. He chose to take it, but it was, he wanted to take it." And I'm like, we went, I mean, Ben, I know you went on a rant with that on that last podcast where it was like, [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1107s) of course, you don't have any choice, right? So I'm going to let you, Craig, respond to that whole comment with, you know, like it's not your choice.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1117s)

Well, I would say the issue of choice was canvassed fairly extensively by the New South Wales Healthcare Complaints Commission. But personally for me, there's two things. First of all, when you're in that environment, of course you want to change because you know that being gay is not accepted by any of the people you love and care about. And the only way that you can avoid being cast out is to try and change. So of course you want to change. And we all had this experience. Like I genuinely thought that Bruce Hales would be [able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1147s) to wave his hands over me and turn me straight, and I was kind of surprised when that didn't happen.

And saying yes, okay, yes, that is what I wanted as a teenager. Was it the right thing for me? Absolutely not. But I was responding to the conditioning of the Brethren environment. And the idea as well that you have the option of saying no, because if you follow the Brethren logic through, they believe that Bruce Hales is God [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1177s) earth and everything he says is God's voice speaking to you directly. To say no to Bruce Hales is like saying no to God. And so Bruce Hales says you should go and see a doctor, you should look at treatment for your sexuality. You're never, ever going to say no as a teenager in the Brethren.

It's like telling God himself to go, you know, it's like, "Fuck you, God," is kind of what you're saying if you turn down something from Bruce Hales. And so this whole idea that people in groups like the Brethren, "Oh, that's their choice, they can say no," I call bullshit on that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1217s)

Yeah, could you imagine if you had said no? But it's just not an option. I mean, I look at Joey and everything that you've been through. I mean, obviously we've chatted a lot, so I know you beyond everything that we're saying on here. And I do, like, could you imagine Joey turning around and being like, "No, I am who I am. I'm going to stay here. I'm going to still be a part of the Brethren. I just need you to accept me as I am." There's no way. There's no way that any three of you would have been allowed to [stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1247s) a part of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which is what it is now, and stay gay. There's no way.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1255s)

Not an option. Yeah, it's literally not an option. And also, religion aside, despite the fact that you're conditionally groomed all your life to bow and scrape to Bruce Hales, religion aside, you are not equipped with the knowledge, with the resources to look up what you're about to undertake. You're undertaking drugs or making choices that are permanent and will have [side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1285s) effects that are permanent. You're not equipped to do that. You don't even have full internet access to Google the repercussions. You're not being, there's a conflict of interest in the sense that the doctor is the same cult, same religion. Your family aren't again equipped with any sort of academic knowledge to help you understand what you're about to undertake. So of course, it's not a, there's no choice, there's no option. You actively [choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1315s) it because you want to conform and your sense of belonging that is the Brethren is at risk.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1321s)

And you want to be with your family.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1323s)

Yeah, of course you choose it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1325s)

Yeah, when those drugs were prescribed to me, there was no discussion about potential side effects and what the risks and benefits were or whether this was the correct application for this drug. I was just written a prescription with enough repeats for me to just take this medication for a year without ever seeing another doctor. And it's like, well, how is that going to go? And then you start, and it's difficult when you're in an environment [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1355s) that, you start feeling these side effects, but you're in such a state of emotional turmoil that it's hard to... So when I started feeling sluggish and anxious and depressed and all of those things, I just thought it was because of everything that was going on in the Brethren. It took a few weeks to be like, "Ah, maybe it's these pills the doctor gave me."

So it's not even just about being able to figure out what's going on, but you know, you need to have the framework to even [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1385s) the language to describe what's happening to you. And I think this is, for anyone who comes out as gay in the Brethren, before you can come out as gay, you have to realize what being gay even is and that there are words that describe how you feel.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1401s)

Yeah. How have your parents responded to you coming out as non-binary, Joey?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1408s)

They don't actually know. I was speaking with my therapist about this and we talked about the idea of how it's becoming more popular to invite people in rather than come out. So it's not like a huge thing for you all the time, but rather you slowly invite people that you trust into your inner circle and you can tell them about yourself or whatever's going on with your life, rather than [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1438s) coming out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1438s)

Yeah, that's really good. That's a really good point.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1442s)

Could you explain a little bit as well about what it means for you to be non-binary and what that journey was like?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1454s)

Yeah, so obviously I grew up in a really transphobic environment, so I'm still kind of learning the correct terminology around that, but I've just recently come into a place where I'm safe to start exploring my gender identity. It's just always been part of who I am. Even when I was little, I never thought about my gender unless I was absolutely forced to. So at school, I wouldn't be like, "Oh, I'm a girl, so I can't do such and [such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1485s) or whatever." The only time I thought about it was lining up to go back into class, we had to line up boys and girls. So I would be like, "Oh, well, I guess I have to go line up with the girls then," and going to the bathroom and things like that.

But even when I was a little kid, I always wanted to one day walk down the street and have people wonder, "Oh, is that a boy or is that a girl?" And looking back, I think it was more about [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1515s) one day being in a place where I could present myself as me and not as who everyone around me wanted me to be. So I think even as a little kid, I just kind of craved a place where I could just be who I was and not have people question that.

Even recently talking about gender, I'm kind of just like, "I'm not a boy or a girl, I'm just Joey. I'm just me." That's who I am. When I was a kid, I was outside playing with tools and trucks, and for my fourth birthday, I was gifted a hacksaw, which I feel like sums up my childhood in one sentence.

But I'm really grateful that my parents let me be a tomboy and didn't force me into dresses and frilly clothes and whatnot.

But basically at this point, to me, it means that I get to be who I am. I don't have to follow the gender norms for a boy or for a girl. I can just be me. But obviously, it means different things to different people as well.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1591s)

To each, yeah. And I was going to say that that's totally okay. I think we've had previous podcasts where, which I wasn't on, but I actively wanted to say something about because I fully believe that there is no normal gay and there's no normal hetero. There's no normal. There is an expression of who you want to be and that's okay. And quite frankly, it's nobody else's fucking business who you want to be, [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1622s) you want to be, and who you want to be with. As long as you're happy, safe, and peaceful, then that's all that matters.

And I think as humans in a society, we try and put labels and put things into boxes because it all feels neat and good and "I feel safe and okay," and you know, with the real world. That's not reality. That's not the real world. It is a confusing world we live in, and as long as you can be okay with that and it works for you, then that's fine. We should be respectful of people's choices. There's [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1658s) like, and I think the reason I'm bringing it up is because I was so aware of how that would have made me feel when I was back in the Brethren if I had heard a Brethren male that had left say, "I'm not a sissy gay, I'm not a femme gay, I'm more of a normal gay." There's no normal. We're in touch with our femininity, we're in touch with our masculinity, and that's okay. Someone can dip more into either. I dip into both. I wear pearls and I'll wear a lumberjack top. Who cares? At the end of the day, that's how I [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1688s) great doing that. And so on your journey, Joey, you've got a group of people out here that will support you on that, however you want to feel, as long as you feel safe.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1698s)

And I think that's the biggest misunderstood thing in the LGBTQ+ community, right? Is that it changes, it's fluid, it changes. I have a family very, very close to me with their kids that, I think the whole point of everything that's exploding in the world today is get out of labels. Get out of what it is. It shouldn't matter to you if that person is kind, if that person is caring, if that person, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1728s) it just is. You said it perfectly, Joey, where you just want to be Joey, right? Why do we have to attach other labels to it?

And I do think that that is one of the things that your generation is teaching us because it doesn't matter. Get out of the labels, get out of what we think society should be, classified in this group and this group, and let's just be who we are. I mean, I've met a lot of non-binary people who would blow anybody else out of the water with their compassion. They're just normal human beings like [everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1759s) else. How they decide to present themselves to the world, that's their choice. And I guess that's the biggest thing that I get so frustrated and angry over, is that when we see comments and we have people that are replying and people that are just, they're not thinking about what they're putting down in a comment before they put it. It's just ridiculous. I just think that the world has made this much more difficult than what it needs to be instead of just letting everybody be who [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1789s) want to be.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1790s)

And for those that are commenting from a place of, you know, you came from the Brethren, the same cult that we did, you of all people should understand, right? It's we all live in the same world out here, and quite frankly, it's nobody's business. It doesn't affect you and it's not setting some standard. There are no standards. You live in the real world, there's no Brethren standard.

Yeah, me too. I get very frustrated about it too, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1823s)

I just think you were in a cult for how many years. You should be just given a complete free pass to experiment and explore who you are and who your identity is. Nobody should comment on it. You should just be given that free pass of like, Joey gets to be Joey, in whatever she/they decide to be.

Yeah, it gets me riled up.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1849s)

I get slightly, I'm just baffled about why people feel threatened by these things. It's like, what impact does it have on your life? It has zero impact. Why do you have to be a hater?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1859s)

Well, you've just said it. They feel threatened. You know, when new knowledge is presented to us or something's unknown and we don't understand it, our natural primal instinct is to feel either fear or fight it, and that's usually what comes out, the feeling threatened and standing up and fighting it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1877s)

The generational thing is interesting as well because when you're young, you're at the cutting edge of radical thinking, or you think you are. And then you get a bit older, and I'm finding now there's another generation of activists that are coming through under me that are just a little bit more radical than I am, and I'm just like, "Oh, that's a bit far for me."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1902s)

You're just getting old, Craig.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1905s)

But it's super, we often talk about this at work. It's like, you can't just lock in your generation of thinking as, "This is how radical we're going to be and we're not going to go any further," because there's just going to be wave after wave after wave of young people coming through who see the world in very different terms to how we see them and to how older generations see them. I think what I really admire is the people who are able to hold that space and say, "Hey, there's this [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1936s) new generation of people coming through that see the world in a totally different way, and that's not necessarily how I see it, but that's all good." We're never all going to see the same way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1945s)

And to come from a place of curiosity instead of judgment, right? I did day home for like 12 years, so that was, I had to instill that very, very early on when I've got six boys in my house. You just have to come from a state of curiosity instead of just that judgment right away. To me, I love having conversations with people like this. I love it because you get to understand just how they're thinking and how they are who they are. I think that [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1975s) is the big thing out of all of this. And my message, I guess, for anybody watching this is instead of judging Joey, be curious. I mean, she's the kindest human you're ever going to meet. I just love her.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=1989s)

And that aside, from a purely academic perspective, if you think about it, imagine if science or technology had that mindset. "No, no, we have the most advanced, our generation has thought of the most in terms of science or medical health." We wouldn't be where we are today. We're in a space of 70 years of taking flying to landing on the moon. If we had that approach to everyday thinking, we wouldn't have the medical science, we wouldn't have [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2019s) general science, we wouldn't have the knowledge we have today. So apply it in all aspects of your life too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2024s)

Yeah. So getting back into your journey that you experienced, Joey, one of the questions I wanted to ask you is if you ever witnessed any sexual harassment or sexual abuse.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2037s)

Yeah, I experienced some myself. It started when I was 16\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2045s)

Joey describes her sexual harassment, but due to legalities, we had to omit parts of this conversation.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2060s)

It happened all the time and at one point he took a picture of my legs and then sent it to me with a leg and a tooth emoji, I guess suggesting that he'd like to bite my legs or how good they looked. Especially on days when I wore black tights, he'd be like, "Oh, your legs just look good," or he'd say, "Oh, if you just worked out, you could have amazing quads." At one point he asked me what size skirt I wore and what my bra size was. [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2090s) I was absolutely terrified and really just wanted him to leave me alone. Afterwards, he would send me pictures asking for my bra size, like send pictures of and then insert the bra size there.

That is the point where I finally drew the line, thankfully, and wouldn't give in at all on that. Then I went through a period in time where I would be driving along and I'd just have to pull over and burst into tears. And I didn't understand why. I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2120s) super ashamed at the time. I have to remind myself of how I was raised and the environment that I was raised in, where you listen to your elders and you listen to men. I was between the ages of 16 and 20 when this happened. And I was struggling with my sexuality at the time as well, and just super lost. I thought I would see something like this before it even started, or I thought it would never happen to me. I just thought of so many ways to justify his actions and blame [myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2151s) But in the end, he was the adult in that situation. He knew better.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2155s)

And you know what, I totally relate to how when you're in there, it's just like you don't want anything uncovered. You want it to stop, but you don't want it to get uncovered because you're so, you just internalize everything, right? The emotions, the whole everything. You internalize literally everything that they should be feeling, you feel, and then you internalize that and carry it for both of you. When really, if we were brought up in a normal environment [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2186s) had people around that we knew that we could trust and action would happen, you would go to them with the issue and it would be dealt with. But inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, it's not like that. We know from looking around us, things are not dealt with like that. You never hear of things being brought up in meeting. Those kinds of things aren't brought up in meeting, they're not talked about publicly.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2207s)

I think the worst thing was a lot of the stuff was just hidden in plain sight. Growing up, I remember we had a great uncle who was referred to as "Dirty Dave" because he would grope women. He was the one that your mom and your sisters would at all costs avoid going in for a hug and a kiss with because he was Dirty Dave. Everyone knew how Dirty Dave acted, but it was never actually, "This is sexual harassment or assault [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2237s) someone needs to put a stop to this." It was just Dirty Dave became a running joke in the family and in the Brethren more widely. And turning it into a joke kind of allowed it all to just sit there in plain sight without ever being addressed.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2252s)

Yeah, I agree. It's like they enable it and harbor it, right?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2257s)

Yeah. I remember one time, he's long dead now so there's no defamation risk, but I remember one time he grabbed a woman's bum as she was going into the hall. Her husband came along and just about punched his lights out and he was like, "What are you on about? She was just late for the meeting, I was trying to help her get in." No, you weren't, you were just being a perv.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2284s)

And then when they're more serious, like I know somebody that was raped and they wanted to take it further or wanted something to be done about it, they were essentially sat down and said, "You know what this is going to cost the family? You know what it's going to cost everybody for everybody to find out about this?" Well, here's a news flash, they're all going to find out about it anyway and it's going to be very public when they do.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2312s)

Yeah, or even worse is the ones who come forward and tell the leaders they've been raped and then get forced to marry their rapists.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2320s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2322s)

Yeah, what? That's insane.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2327s)

That's sad, so sad. So many things wrong. I think if they just would realize that it's not as bad as what they think it is by bringing it forward. This isn't just the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, there's lots of places where things are hidden like this. If they would just realize that if they brought it forward, made it public, got the authorities involved, they would actually build their report, that would actually build them up. It would give them some credibility and integrity versus this [constant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2357s) hiding underneath things. So one of the other questions that I wanted to ask you is about alcohol and alcoholism in the PBCC. What did you witness yourself in that department? What did you witness with alcohol?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2371s)

Going to school, there were boys in my class and previous classes who would bring alcohol in their water bottles to school. We had to cover up for them occasionally, like wiping the room down before teachers came in and emptying out water bottles and filling them back up with water and stuff like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2393s)

Wow. And I mean, we've heard that from other teachers too, right? That was in, I can't really say where it was, but in other parts of the world that same issue has happened.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2405s)

Yeah, we used to have, we found bottles of stuff stashed above rooms in the ceiling and stuff like that at school.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2417s)

How old would these boys have been?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2418s)

The ones in our class were in grade 12, so 17\. Also, I don't know if it's global or what, but Vancouver at least approached several liquor stores about getting a kickback on any liquor purchases made by Brethren to the school. I think they had to approach a few before they got a yes because most of them were [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2449s), "What the... are you talking about? We're not going to support schools for a liquor store." But I think they finally found one that if you go in, I think you have to show a card or something and they will give the school a kickback or something like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2465s)

That's insane. That's crazy. And I mean, we know that they have a lot of their Campus & Co have alcohol in it. But this is a way for them to obviously get a little bit more money if they can find a liquor store that the Brethren frequent to still get some money. That's crazy. That's just insane.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2484s)

Our Campus & Co didn't have alcohol in it. I don't know if they couldn't get permission or what, but they didn't have it there. So I guess this was their way of getting money back for alcohol.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2496s)

Wow. Oh, that's insane. Crazy. Wow. I'm going to move forward. We talked about how we wanted to talk about Myles and Lee Admiraal in a situation that they were involved in. This is a few years ago.

And one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up was in podcast 112, you heard Matthew. Matthew was talking about when he was leaving his work, he was questioning them about some things and they had come right out and called Ben and Craig faggots, which again, in this world, that term is just not used anymore. I mean, like, get with the 21st century. The reason why [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2545s) wanted to bring up this Lee and Myles Admiraal court case that went on was that was exactly what happened years ago. So if you see that a term that was used years ago and they apologized for this, and I'm going to bring up the court case here, it still is happening. It's still a term that is still used today. It's still not cleaned up. It is a term that is readily used in there and it is very, very derogatory. People just don't use that terminology anymore. So [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2575s) going to share a screen with you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2577s)

Unless you're gay and you're talking about fellow gays.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2579s)

Yeah. So I am going to attach in the link below, I will attach the full court case records. I'm going to share a slide with you on this.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2590s)

Just kidding. On that note, Cheryl, people like the Brethren still using the same terminology, that comes as no surprise as they have not evolved. They don't evolve. They are the same religious group they were 140 years ago. Yes, there are stricter rules.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2607s)

Okay, so this is Lee Admiraal and Myles Admiraal. And yes, these are relatives of Lane's and he gave us full permission to say whatever we needed to say. So this is Lane's dad and his brother that were involved in this.

So Lee Admiraal is a member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in Montreal, Quebec. He was 16 and 17 years old when the attacks took place. And as we know, homophobia is instilled into the PBCC members from a very, very young age.

So the following slides have been taken from the court transcript, so the present tense is used at times. This is the case. There's two men, Roger and Theo, were two gay men who had lived together as a couple at the residence in Pointe-Claire since 1978\. On July 18, 2002, they became the first gay male couple to formalize their union under Quebec civil union law.

The incidents involving the victims and the defendant occurred between April and November 2003, when the defendant was 16 and 17 years old. On April 18, 2003, around 9 p.m., a dark blue pickup truck drove past the victim's residence. One of the passengers threw toilet paper from the truck onto their car and lawn. The couple called the police, filed a report, and gave police a videotape of the incident. The following day on April 19, 2003, [someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2699s) was heard screaming "faggots" from the street. When one of the victims looked outside, he saw the same dark blue pickup truck speeding away, tires screeching.

On November 10, 2003, around 11:30 p.m., so almost midnight, the blue pickup truck drove by again. According to the victims, a flare was thrown from the truck and huge flames and fireballs could be seen on the roof, rolling on the lawn and into the street. Although there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2729s) no damage to their property, the victims claimed to have been very frightened by the attack, rightfully so. On November 21, 2003, as the victims were driving home, they stopped at a convenience store and noticed the same blue pickup truck and a group of young people who had stopped to buy some beer.

When the victims drove away, they were followed to their driveway and insults such as "fucking faggots" were yelled at them from the truck.

Incensed, the victims decided to get back into the car, follow the truck, and finally identify the culprits. The truck turned onto a street called Broadview and drove into the parking lot of a community church. The victims stopped their car, effectively blocking the truck's way. The defendant got out of the truck and approached the victim's car. When the victim refused to move or open the window, the defendant repeatedly banged on the window, trying to open the car door, and threatened to strike one of the victims with his fist.

The victims heard the defendant say that he would rather break his fucking face than break his fist on the window. Then they dialed 911 from the car and the defendant ran away.

The victims claimed to continue to live in constant fear for their safety. They no longer listen to music, they have trouble sleeping, and are constantly afraid of what might happen next. The couple has even canceled plans to travel together so as not to leave their home unattended. More particularly, Roger testified that the events caused him to relive the profound trauma of accepting his homosexuality and that is still something he is trying to deal with with help from his psychologist. Theo, his partner, added that his once successful artistic career [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2827s) been destroyed. He is no longer able to paint because of his anxiety.

The defendant explained that he had heard of the victims through the local papers and disapproved of their openly homosexual lifestyle. Although he had never met them personally, his disapproval of homosexuality stems from his religious beliefs as a member of the Brethren church, a conservative Christian church that teaches that homosexuality is a sin. The defendant only admitted to calling them "fags" on one occasion on April [18,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2858s) 2003, and he categorically denied ever using the word "fucking" as alleged by the victims. He also denied throwing a flare at the victim's property and claimed it was merely a firecracker with a small stick. He explained that there was no fire, only sparks, and all it did was go "bang." He explained that it was late at night and that he was probably just trying to show off in front of his friends.

With respect to the threats he added on November 21, 2003, he explained that he merely wanted the victims to move their car so [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2888s) could leave with his truck and that he would never have stricken either victim. Regarding his education, he claimed that although his father had told him that homosexuality is legal in Canada, he could not recall whether he had been told that homosexuals have rights or that discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation are prohibited. I'm going to reread that again for you listeners. Regarding his education, he claimed that although his father had told him that homosexuality is [legal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2918s) in Canada, he could not recall whether he had been told that homosexuals have rights or that discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation are prohibited. This is an outright omission of the truth. The PBCC are taught from a young age that homosexuality is sinful.

The verdict. There is no doubt, given the facts established, that the damages caused by the defendant's actions were unlawful and intentional within the meaning of Section 49 of the Charter. On several occasions, he deliberately humiliated, intimidated, and harassed the victims. Given the gravity of the acts committed and the importance of dissuading others from engaging in similar behavior, yet also considering the defendant's apology and expression of remorse, the tribunal decided the amount of $2,500 to each victim was appropriate for [punitive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=2970s) damages and $5,000 to each victim for moral damages.

So this is an issue. It's an issue that was back then. And as we heard from our last podcast, 112, it still is an issue, right? This teaching is not taught in the school. There's no teaching out there on how to be compassionate or how to be open to having somebody else live around you that has a different lifestyle. This is what we've been talking about all along. It's just not accepted and then you get this kind of behavior. This is one of the things that has always been a worry of mine. As we've brought a lot of these survivors on these podcasts, we're like, how many podcasts, over 111 podcasts that we're out here now, and because there has been no compassion given to anybody who has done these podcasts, we know how they're talking inside there. All it takes is one person that is like this to come and think that they're doing [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3030s) work for Bruce Hales. I do think it is a huge issue that they can have on their hands if they don't stop and think about how they are running their church.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3040s)

Or even educate.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3042s)

Yeah, right, educate them. And this is an issue, like when Bruce Hales says, "Do XYZ by whatever means necessary."

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3052s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3053s)

Your interpretation of "whatever means necessary," there's no limit to that. Do you kidnap someone? Do you forcibly prevent them from leaving? Do you take their kids off them?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3068s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3068s)

We know the Brethren think they're above the law. The assembly is the highest court in the land, as they believe. And so it's not necessarily about what someone like Bruce Hales intends when he says, "Do whatever it takes," it's about how extremely that's interpreted by the members.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3089s)

Yeah, and all it does take is one extremist within that extreme group to think he's doing the Lord's work or Bruce's work. Case in point, I've got an ongoing court case with somebody that thought the same thing. And interesting, I had somebody reach out recently after all this stuff's come up about the Brethren in papers. They were at a uni day, I can't remember the [exact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3119s) year, but I've got it all written down. Sydney campus went to a Sydney university, I think it was, and essentially they had a Pride stand, like an orientation day where they showed what happened at university. I don't think they do this anymore because there was one kid from Sydney school, they started heckling this Pride stand and lunged and attacked this stand. There's video footage out there, all these kids put out their cameras and [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3150s) videoing him screaming and yelling abuse at this pride stand, these other kids, and literally went into full psychotic mode.

Nothing has changed. They're so uneducated. You are taught from such a young age to literally hate. I had a teacher, a couple of teachers reach out and share a story about an exercise they did at school where they had a little hand and they had to write [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3180s) on each finger five things that would make the world a better place, and a majority of the kids wrote in there, "Get rid of gays." That is unbelievable. Unbelievable that mentality. Unbelievable, but again, not surprising.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3195s)

Yeah, and I've talked to Lane about this situation, and he said this wasn't out of their character at all. For Lane to say that about his own family, it's just so sad that they're not taught how to be more open, they're not taught how to live inside a society that has different beliefs. The way that the spokespersons come back and give the remarks that they do in articles, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3225s) is what is most infuriating. It's the RRT people that go out and they're supporting certain things. These people have no idea how condescending they are, how racist they are, how homophobic they are.

And then it comes out in kids. Again, they said he was between 16, 17 years old when this was all going down. It is going to be their demise. In our last podcast, 112, we heard Matthew talk about how [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3256s) person that he was talking to actually specifically said that the one thing that they wish, they wish that the ex-Brethren didn't exist. So you have to understand that if a 16-year-old gets a hold of that kind of a comment and gets some idea in their head of what they could do with that...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3274s)

Yeah, and it's not just sexuality here. We're talking about women that speak up. We're talking about sexist views, ageist views, we're talking about racist views. It's all in the same... yes, they have a separate, vehement hate for the queer community. It's almost unprecedented, the hate they harbor for them, but it's in other areas too. Like a political party that doesn't align with their views, even [though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3304s) they don't vote. It's scary because you're teaching children and kids to grow up like this. This is why I think it's so important they don't have their own schools.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3315s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3315s)

They have to assimilate, they have to integrate and learn and realize what the real world is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3323s)

And I'm sure this is what you were talking about, Joey, when you were talking about watching your dad do his protesting, right? You witnessed it firsthand, of you being a kid having to support your dad in what he's doing because of his belief of, "This can't be accepted."

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3340s)

One thing that struck me as you were reading that out is how he admitted to using the word "fags," but not "fucking," because in there it's so awful to say "fucking" or anything along those lines, yet it's perfectly okay to say "fags," I guess.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3357s)

Yeah, it's like, "I didn't sin, I didn't swear."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3364s)

At 11:30 at night, he was out at 11:30 at night.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3366s)

11:30 at night, don't you have a life? Oh, but you don't. I forgot, you're in a cult.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3376s)

Anyhow, there is an article that was made from that. There are a few articles, I'll attach a link to them below in the article and you guys can go ahead and read this.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3386s)

And also on that note, how traumatizing for an elderly couple that's probably been through the '60s, '70s, '80s trauma that follows of coming out and not coming out in a safe environment. They've probably already experienced that. Imagine being thrown back into that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3405s)

Yeah. And I'm just going to attach another article here. It's from Press Progress that went through, they wrote an article on how the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church had done a campaign to try and stop gay marriage in Canada. So I'll attach that article here. And then there's another article here that I wanted to touch on, and this was written by Michael Bachelard, and I'm actually going to get you, Craig, to just give a quick comment on this article.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3437s)

Yeah, so this article was 2016, so it's eight years ago now. And this was in response to, again, the Brethren made a statement on a story and one of the things that the Brethren said in their statement was they denied that they were homophobic.

And this is what you're saying about the spokespeople coming out and saying things, and they will just deny that they're homophobic, deny that they're racist, deny that they're sexist, deny that they break up families. So this was a really good piece that just unpacked, the headline says it all, "The Brethren deny being anti-gay, here's proof they are." And if you go through the story, it's a compilation of all sorts of things that the Brethren have said and done, including the political campaigns that run [against](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3491s) gay marriage or marriage equality or Don't Ask, Don't Tell they campaigned against in the 1990s, which was the legislation around queer people in the US military.

You've got quotes from meetings with Bruce Hales, and this is something as well that the Brethren have not always tried to deny because if you go back 20, 30 years when it was more acceptable to be homophobic in society, in 2006 Daniel Hales quite proudly told journalists that back when he was a boy, homosexuals went to prison and he thought that was a good thing. Wow.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3532s)

And for Daniel Hales to say that, knowing that there's a chance that there could be gay people within his own wider family or family, how toxic.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3547s)

Yeah. And so then we've got, there's the pamphlets that they've run in Australia and Canada, and they were organizing political action. I remember when I was a teenager, the prayer meetings that we were holding about the Civil Union bill that was going through in New Zealand. And as we say in the story there, when the Australian government was, this is a while ago now, 2004, proposing legislation to define [marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3578s) as being between a man and a woman, the Brethren were in parliament every day.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3582s)

And that was in Canberra, in Australia. They actually sat down with the Prime Minister, John Howard, and they were there helping write the Marriage Act. Remember they used to boast about it? I remember being in a lounge room at my grandfather's where Bruce Hales brought it up.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3605s)

Yeah. So the very idea that the Brethren would claim that they're not homophobic...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3613s)

I mean, if they weren't homophobic, how many people would still be in there? Well, maybe not be in there, but you know what I mean, you wouldn't have to leave because you're gay. I want to come back to Joey for a second because she sent me some pictures that are absolutely, the transformation that you went through from when you were in there to who you are now, I think this is just so incredible to watch you come into your own skin. And excuse the dirty mirror on this one.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3644s)

So I'm going to get you to walk us through what we're seeing here.

Basically, this was quite a while before I left, and this was one of the outfits that I wore to meeting.

I absolutely hate dressing in anything like that now. In fact, I put on a skirt the other day and it gave me a panic attack, so I don't do that anymore. But this is standard dress for meetings and whatnot in there. I have friends now who look at pictures of me from back in there and they're like, "You were so dead inside back then."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3677s)

Yeah, you look so unhappy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3681s)

Yeah, and the scarves with their form, they were just so big.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3686s)

They were, that wasn't even one of the bigger scarves that I've ever worn. I usually stuck to one scarf form, as they call it, but there were people in there who layered up three or four on top of each other so it's just sticking out a good five inches above their head.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3704s)

Oh.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3706s)

That was after I cut my hair. I think I partially left at this point and I cut my hair to shoulder length before going a little higher. But yeah, this was on my way out there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3727s)

And you can tell you're coming into your own. You're just owning your presence here. You can start feeling the confidence and your appearance is really coming through of like, "Yeah, I know who I am."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3738s)

There's actually life, you can't see it here, but the other photo, there's actually life beginning to spark in your eyes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3746s)

And then this is my favorite.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3749s)

I love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3750s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3750s)

You look like you're about to run a board meeting, CEO.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3755s)

Yeah, all the time. They're like, "You gotta dress up for meeting." I'm like, "Why can't I just wear a suit though?" Because I feel like a suit is more me. I love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3765s)

Ah, well, we're very, very grateful that you came back on. We're able to fill in all the pieces that you never got to fill us in last time. So again, for those that haven't seen her other podcast, her other podcast was podcast number 93\. So if you haven't watched it yet, definitely go back and re-watch that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3787s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3788s)

It's just so incredible to see how far you've come and how you really are owning who you are, and that's okay that it changes, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3800s)

Definitely an evolution and that's totally fine. You'll change your style, you change the way you feel, you can change your religion. That's the beauty of being out here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3808s)

Yeah, choice. You have choice. So I lost internet there and I have re-hooked back up, but unfortunately, Ben and Craig had to go back to work. So Joey and I are going to just finish this out. Go ahead, Joey, you were saying something when my internet cut out about labels.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3826s)

I think people are just kind of hesitant to identify with anything particularly because then if they change it, they feel like they weren't valid to begin with. Like whatever they identified as first wasn't valid. I don't think that's the case. I think it's just all a journey and not really any destination, so it's okay to change over the years. Everyone does. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3857s) think personally, I'm kind of drawn to labels because it just makes explaining things easier. But I also came across an article the other day about who we are without labels. It was like a journaling prompt as well. It was like, "Write down who you are without your labels." So you aren't someone who does such and such for work. You aren't a parent to someone. You aren't a child to someone. Who are you as a person? [Yes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3887s) it's really hard to do that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3890s)

And you know what? I think those labels are good to have when you're trying to understand who you are, you're trying to understand a situation. But don't let labels confine you to who you are for your entire life. Let those labels be fluid. That's what I think is important, right? Is just be flexible. And that's the one thing that we're seeing time and time again is that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is not flexible. They don't allow for difference of opinions or different ways of [beliefs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3921s)

Could you imagine what it would be like if we had a mainstream Christian church? I've gone to a United Church here in Red Deer before, where they have the gay pride flag painted on their walkway going up to the church. So there are churches that are out there that are accepting of these things. And I think that's the one thing that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have not evolved in. They've evolved in their technology, they've evolved in all these different [ways.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3951s) But they have not evolved with the 21st century when it comes to accepting people and their sexuality. This is a massive thing in this world. Almost everybody knows how to accept people who are gay. Yes, we're still getting used to non-binary and trans and all those other ways of identifying with yourself, but just simply gay and lesbian, those are two simple things [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3981s) they are really stuck way back in the 1900s with, aren't they?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=3986s)

I don't know if there's a way that they could accept homosexuality and trans people without accepting it all. I think that that kind of thing is an all-or-nothing situation and I don't ever see them accepting all of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4010s)

I agree. I agree. Well, I'm really, really, really proud of you, Joey, for coming on here and you know, really presenting everything in a way that people just get to know you for who you are.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4022s)

I think my goal in coming on this time was kind of just, I want people in there to realize that it doesn't have to be a big thing for you to report it to someone. When it comes to sexual harassment, it doesn't have to be a massive thing and you're like, "Oh, well, I guess I have to tell about that," or, "I can't talk about this because it's just so small, nobody will pay attention." You can go to [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4052s) if you're uncomfortable. You have a right to be comfortable wherever you are and you can go to your parents or people about that. And you can follow up on it. I probably should have done a better job of following up in my case.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4072s)

And there's the police too. If you really, really want, if you're not getting anywhere, there's social workers. Just Google, I mean, I guess you can't when you're inside there, but at the end of our podcast, we always have a ton of numbers that you can call. Or reach out to one of us and we'll find numbers for you that you can call.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4091s)

Absolutely. Or even just the non-emergency line for your local police department, I'm sure would have resources for you to reach out to as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4104s)

Exactly. Well, thank you so, so much. I really appreciate this. And I know, again, that this is going to relate and help those other closeted kids that are inside there, and that can relate to what you have discussed and explained on here. So I appreciate your vulnerability and allowing yourself just to explain why you are who you are.

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4128s)

Yeah. Thank you very much for having me on. Anytime. If anyone needs support or wants to contact me, feel free to. I'm more than happy to chat.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4139s)

And do you have an email that they can reach you at?

### [**Joey Green**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4141s)

Yeah, they can reach out. I believe it's joeydenay@proton.me. I'm available there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uIunkS_Jfo&t=4153s)

Perfect. Okay. I'm going to end this podcast with another song that Bruce Thompson wrote, and it is another incredible song. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bruce, for putting these songs out. They are so incredible. They're so healing. And I know that so many people are reaping the benefits from them. So thank you. So until next time, everyone, much love to you all. Take care. Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
