### [**Podcast Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=11s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are joined here by Carman Drever. And our special guest is David and Nicé Shorto. Is that how you pronounce it?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=30s)

You-nee-see. Eunice. Okay. It's like her mom used to say, you don't say Penny-lope. It's a bit tough on people who are called  Eunice, but anyway, I prefer the fancy way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=48s)

Well, welcome\! We're grateful that you joined us today. Okay. If you can just give us a short introduction on where you're from, when you left, and what it was like in the PBCC, formerly known as Exclusive Brethren, at your time, on what it was like when you left.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=66s)

Yes. Well, we left in 1981\. I was 38\. And we've been in from birth, both of us. We're both third or fourth generation EB families. My father and his father were certainly all in the Brethren, and I think the great grandfather before that. My father was a great preacher, and I used to go around with him. And I enjoyed, and I really was fond of my father and admired him.

I'm one of six kids, I'm the second one, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=96s) I was the awful one who's always trying to catch up with my older brother, and you know we kind of fought every day. But I really respected my dad, but I had doubts about the hypocrisy of the Brethren. That's what really riled me for years, because they said one thing and they weren't acting it out, and that kind of thing really got under my skin.

I used to query it with people. And of course, if you start [querying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=126s) things, then you're suspect and you're, you know, dodgy. You mustn't say, you mustn't ask questions. So I kind of bottled it up. Then Aberdeen happened. And I thought, well, that's ridiculous. You know, that is just, that's beyond the pale. You've got to do something. But everything was hushed up, you know, the whole business and our pure brother, we all have to say, you know, we trusted him.

I sort of ground my teeth and said what I needed to say. But [really,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=156s) from then onwards, I thought, this is daft. But again, I respected my dad. And funnily enough, the weekend before, not many people know this, but he was at Preston the weekend, the Saturday before, the weekend before Aberdeen. His behavior there was so outrageous my dad came away absolutely shocked. He actually said to me quietly, he said that he should be taken home and horsewhipped because he was horrified at what he was doing. Was he drunk? Well yes, I mean he was always drunk, wasn't he?

Yeah, I actually testified to that Lane in court in Holland. You remember the Dutch book case?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=202s)

Oh yeah. No. Yeah. I remember that.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=205s)

Yeah. The thing that, yeah, the Brethren trapped behind the Dutch bookcase. I was asked to go and testify there and the judge asked me, did you see him drunk? I said, well, he was drinking a pale amber-colored liquid during the meeting and he gave every appearance of being drunk. So either he was drunk or he was putting on a very good imitation of it. Without breathalyzing him you couldn't say. 

The Leader was drunk. And his behavior at Prston was outrageous. It shocked my dad, but he said to me, he came out after a while. He said to me, I can't believe that the Man of God has sinned. He said, if he has, it calls into question the whole recovery of the truth. So he kind of gone back to, you know, what he trusted and believed in and he suppressed his own doubts, which is a shame, really.

Anyway, the next 11 years, we hung on. 1981, that's 11 years later. What finally released us was Carmen's grandad. Thank you, Carmen. Because you'll hear the fuss over the royal wedding. Prince Charles and Lady Di got married and the Brethren all watched it on TV one way or another. Anybody who'd had anything to do with the royal wedding, Mr. Symington said shut them up for a week.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=295s)

Yeah, you know.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=297s)

Whatever it was, even if you hadn't even watched it on television, whatever. Well, I hadn't even seen it, but Nicé and her mum and dad had gone down to the airport and watched it on some black and white portable, you know, ridiculous thing to see something in the royal wedding. And that was enough. You know, the whole man and his household thing. I was responsible. I had actually stayed in bed. It was a day off, so I stayed. I had to catch up some sleep.

Anyway, we were shut up for a week. So my dad rang me up and said, [look,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=327s) just roll with the punches, don't make a fuss, just accept the discipline. And I said, that's ridiculous. I said, if assembly privileges are so important, then I need to know why I'm being denied them. You know, I try to put it in Brethren terms. And from then on, I said, OK, that's it. Unless you can come up with a good explanation, we're done. So it was Mr. Symington's sweeping condemnation that actually was [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=357s) final straw for us.

So we stayed home. And along with most of the Brethren, we're in Manchester, and there was a 400 Brethren meeting, so most of the Brethren were shut up for a week. And they all went back except us. So I said, no, we're not coming anymore. So they used to come and see us every Friday night. The priests would come around. What are you going to do? You have four children, you know, you've got to look after them. Wait, I said, I have no idea. I don't know what we're going to do, but we're not coming back there.

I'd actually like to give a very belated thanks to a brother in Liverpool, which none of you will know, although maybe Anne might have heard of Frank Piper.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=406s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=407s)

Yeah. Frank, lovely guy, just an ordinary, you know, run of the mill PB, but a nice, honest bloke. And I remember at break him saying to us, you know, I keep meeting Christians. It's just amazing. And they're really genuine people. And you know, I thought, yeah, they're out there somewhere. You know, there are some ordinary people out there. They're not all born monsters.

And I sort of, I put that away in my mind and thought, you know, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=438s) I'd like to thank Frank Piper because his testament, if you like, was quite an encouragement to us. So for weeks they'd come and see us. Nine weeks we, before we finally got withdrawn from.

In the meantime, Sue, our oldest, who was 14, said, what shall I do, Dad? You know, what shall I do? I said, I don't know, Sue, what we're going to do. But what do you want to do? She said, well, all my friends are here. I really don't want to leave them all. She had, I think, about ten or twelve girls of about the same age, and they all had parties and had a great time together.

So she even got to live with my second brother, my next brother down, who lived with his wife not far away and they couldn't have children and to them it was like the [daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=483s) they'd never had. And she got on really well with them and she settled in with Ted, my my next brother. And do you remember Ted Shorto?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=495s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're a lovely couple.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=497s)

And they are a lovely couple.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=499s)

Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=499s)

Yeah. For nine weeks. Well in the meantime, we just kept not being there when the priests came. You know, we went camping one weekend and I thought, this is tough, we're not getting anywhere. We've got to give them an excuse. And I was being a bit, I didn't want to give them the usual handle, compromising with those under assembly discipline. And they love to say that, they're rolling it off, you know, because I got an uncle and aunt who left in 1970 and they were constantly wanting to get in touch with us.

They actually called around and said, are you coming out? I said, look, don't, you know, just hang on. Let's get out properly and then we can really get together. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=547s) they went away. They were very decent, although she said, you know, we've been praying for you for 11 years, which is, you know, they're just a lovely couple. Anyway, I finally thought, this is daft. Well, my mother had come in from outside. And she had two brothers and a sister. The sister had joined with her, but the two brothers hadn't joined in.

But I remembered from the 1950s, before the whole ridiculous separation thing was booted up in the 59, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=578s) Uncle Charlie used to come and visit. And Uncle Charlie was a great guy. He'd been in the army. He was full of fun. We were always playing tricks. And we'd had a great time with Uncle Charlie when we were kids. So I knew where he lived because a few years earlier, it had been his 25th wedding anniversary, he sent my mum an invitation and said, go on, Liz, come and join us. Be a devil. Come and join our silver wedding.

And mother showed me this card and sniggered and said, isn't he naughty? So I clocked it and thought, oh yeah, Uncle Charlie, I'm your man. So I got this in my mind where he lived. So we rang him up and I said, oh, is that Uncle Charlie? It's David and Nicé here. I wonder if we can come and stay? So, of course, yeah, you're welcome. Come. Does your mother know? I said, no, she doesn't.

We went down there with the three kids we got left. We left Sue behind with Ted, obviously. So we went down to Havens in Hampshire and stayed with Uncle Charlie for the weekend. Well, of course, the kids, the three of them sat in front of the telly the whole weekend. We had a great time. They went to various places with them and really had a whale of a time with them. Came back home on the Monday. Priest rings up. And this is John Patterson. You remember him? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He was our priest.

So John said, you weren't there when we called on Friday, David. Where were you? I said, yeah, we went to where? Actually, we went to stay with Uncle Charlie. Is he with us? I said, oh no. Did you eat with him? I said, of course you did. I said, well, you know what this means. I said, I certainly hope so. And that was it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=685s)

Good for you.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=686s)

On the Tuesday, well, Tuesday night after the meeting, they came around to the front door, knocked on the front door. I opened the door, said, could we speak to Nicé? I said, yes, of course, come in. Oh no, we won't come in. You've been withdrawn from. I said, yeah, well, I figured that would happen. It was one of the things they threw at me, our brother has a boat. [Well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=717s) I've always been keen on boating. We've always had a boat of some sort.

And what we used to do on care meeting Saturdays, we used to hire a boat and take Brethren out for trips and they were queuing up for it. They say, if you, you know, any chance of coming with you on a Saturday? So, caremeeting Saturdays, we often went boating. Well, in the year up to when we were drawn from, I was in the process of buying a boat myself. I was in the middle of buying it actually, paying with the guy in bits. So this was a correct accusation, but that was what was thrown against me. Our brother has a boat or that's it, you know.

Anyway, that's beside the point because they came to get Nicé and desperate to go on and they said, we'd like to see her alone. I said, oh no, I'll be here because we are together. So he said to Nicé, come with us, we've got the place for you to live with the children, bring the children and it'll help. They deliberately wanted to break up our marriage right there, which is what they do. Yeah. And then she said, no. She said, I'm with my husband. I slept with him last night. That's what you said to them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=790s)

I love it.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=793s)

That's awesome. But if she hadn't been firm, you know, and strong like that, I doubt if we would have stayed out because the thing is, we had, we'd already be half lost soon, you know, which was, and I've seen this happen, people, they lose a child and that they can't bear it. Basically, they go back into a be together with them. Well, this is the miracle bit I was talking to you about, Cheryl, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=823s) know, when I picked up the phone and you were just, you were just messaging me because I'd gone, I actually gone to bed and was trying to get to sleep. I must get up and message you, picked up the phone and you messaged me that very moment.

Well, that very night, Tuesday night, had a phone call out of the blue. This lady called Pauline, I never heard of her. She said, I heard you just left the Exclusives. Now how the grapevine got around that quickly, it's hard to believe, but it does. You know, actually worked out what happened in the end. Uncle Charlie's wife had known this girl in London when they worked together as secretaries and she phoned him up and said, I think you'll find David might be coming out because [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=868s) he’s been to stay with us. So she knew the score.

So Pauline rang up. She said, you won't know me. She said, I left the Exclusives 15 years ago. So he said, I know what you're going through. Where will you take, where would you go to church? I said, I've no idea. I don't know. We'll probably try the Baptist, you might try the Methodist, we'll try something. I don't know. She said, you might like to come to our church. We've got a young man speaking there tomorrow night. I think you'd enjoy. Okay, fair enough. What's your church called? She told me, it was an Evangelical church. I said, okay, well, that was okay.

So we went with the three kids and we sat in the back of this church, honestly. Nicé and I have never forgotten it. We sat there with our three kids and it was an evening, the Wednesday evening, and I don't take kids to a Wednesday evening church meeting ever, you know, that it's not little kids, but we did. And they all made us welcome. We sat there listening to this bloke, he was so brilliant that we just sat there with our mouths open virtually, [ah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=929s) it was so good.

And I turned to Nicé and she said, this is what we've been missing. And it really was as good as that. She said to me, it's like a clear mountain stream after all the rubbish we've been listening to. It was, it was good practical talk and it was a very good speaker. He's gone on to great things. He now, I think he's still pastor of a mega church in Canada and in Toronto, the People's Church in Toronto is Charles Price.

Anyway, [Charles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=959s) Price was a young man then, 40 odd years ago, and we listened to this bloke and afterwards he came to chat with us and I chatted to him. I told him about the Exclusives and he never really never heard them, but I gave him, he was there the next night, I gave him some of Symington's' books. He said, I'll go and visit him. And he went to visit Jim Symington in Neche, I can't believe this lot. I just can't believe them.

Anyway, the point was, you know, that [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=989s) a side issue too, but this church was so good that literally we've been there ever since. And they picked us up and they just made us totally welcome and we've been, we've fitted in like a hand in the glove. And we're still there, like we were there there yesterday. We had a ceilidh on Saturday night. It was a Burns night ceilidh with haggis and bagpipes and all the rest of it and the barn dances and all that stuff. And [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1019s) took another friend and his mum who'd never been. And you know, it's that kind of place, just a really good, happy, friendly atmosphere.

And that was, that was such a good thing for us. And having been there and found how good it was, we said, we can't leave Sue there. We've got to go and get her. Now, that's the tricky bit because, you know, I'm grateful to Ted and Juliet for looking after her. Nothing against them. They were doing what they felt was right. [Sue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1049s) was loving it. They'd made a big heroine of her. They said, you know, you stay faithful and your parents will come back. You've got to stay faithful. They were writing notes to her. Oh yeah. After she left, they kept writing letters saying, you know, you resist and all that kind of stuff..

Anyway, Nicé and I went round there. Remember that one? When are we going to get Sue? Talk about traumatic. Because I waited, I knew Ted would come home about six. I waited till I'd seen his car pull in. So then we went to knock on the door. I said, we've come for Sue, Ted. I'm really grateful you looked after her for nine weeks, but she has to come with us. No, no, no, she's staying with us. She's in the bedroom. You're out, you know, bugger off kind of thing.

So we said, well, sorry, Ted, you do know she's 14, and mum and I both want her to come home, so I'm sorry, you'll have to let her go. No, no. He shut the door. He said, I'll phone up father. You don't say dad anymore, you know, it was all father and mother stuff. So he phoned up my dad who was over in Altrincham, about 11 miles away. My dad comes across, he says, what are you doing to our family? I said, I don't want to do this. I really don't. I don't want to break up the family. But I can't carry on like this. This is just hypocrisy. There's so much that isn't true.

So he said, you're in utter darkness. That's what he said, wasn't it, Nice?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1141s)

I think I'm angry. 

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1143s)

Remember, you were pretty shocked and shaken about that. It was tough. But I said, look, Sue's coming with us. And I went in to see Sue. She was doing her homework and in tears. She said, no, dad, I don't want to come. I want to be with the Brethren. I said, Sue, I know this is awful for you. I know you don't understand. Listen, you're 14\. In a month's time, you're 15\. I promise you, when you're 16, in just over a year's time, if you still want to stay, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1174s) won't stand anyway. Come with us now and stay with us for another year and and just see how things go.

So she's still, I mean, she's no option, basically, poor girl. She had to come. But it took about three months, you know, and but she began to go to the youth group at our church. And then a massive youth group, loads of young people, and they were all very enthusiastic. It's of these groups that win everything. They're the really champions at all kinds of sports and things. So it was an exciting group to be in.

And we booked a holiday in [France,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1213s) a camping holiday, and I said, Sue, you know, I'd like you to come. She was pretty reluctant to come with us at all, but anyway, she came. And just before the holiday, she cut her hair. That is a big deal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1231s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1232s)

She still has very thick hair, but it was, it was right down her back, you know, full length, heavy as anything. She came back with a short haircut. Oh, that was a pretty major moment for us. And now she said, you know, I'm so grateful that you insisted. She's so often said it. She was fairly iffy about coming on this podcast and she would have come, but now she's had to cry off because they've asked her to stay later at work. She [gets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1262s) here in time, she might come and push an appearance.

But anyway, that's how we got out. And honestly, that's that's more or less it. We are so kind of grateful that, I mean, I know Lane doesn't believe in God, but I totally respect that because after what you've been through, I get it. But I have to say, God looks after us. No question to my mind at all. He still does, you know, and I think that's such a privilege. We have a God that really cares for us in all sorts of details. We've never had to, we never really suffered at all and I would hate not to not to know God, really. I really feel the disadvantage, but there we are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1311s)

You know, I find it, yeah, go ahead, Lane.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1314s)

I find it still blows my mind that these people think that they have some entitled right to a child if the parents leave the organization, the cult. That blows my mind that they go, oh no, no, no, no, she's staying with us. What do you want to to get into a physical fight? Like, that just, that's [insanity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1344s) Do they think that they have some kind of some kind of right to a child if the parents want to leave the church?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1352s)

You see something parallel though with the local authorities and people who take children off parents, you know, that kind of, we know better than the parents attitude. But yeah, you're right, Lane, it is unbelievable how they, they have, they assume that right and they assume the right to break up marriages. They think they're doing the right thing to break up marriages.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1376s)

Yeah. What's what's awesome about your story is, and we've heard this before, is how families that get out together, how thankful the children are later in life, you know, realizing the what they avoided, you know? And and just to hear that again is is really nice, you know, just to realize what you did for your family is is incredible.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1404s)

Well, I don't feel any, I could, should have come out long ago, you know, I don't feel any kind of, you know, there's no kudos to me coming out when I did. It was Jim Symington's, really.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1420s)

But you know, that shows too that there's no, there's no right age to leave, right? If you're super young and you get out, I do believe that maybe you can adjust faster. But there's never a wrong time. You know, even if it's at the very end of your life and you realize it, don't think of it negatively. Think of it as an amazing adventure and opportunity.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1445s)

Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I think this, what was it, Peter Hart said, before the kids get married, that that's a very important, that I know you say there's no right, no wrong time, but if you're thinking about it, then for goodness sake, get out before they start getting married because, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1463s)

Yeah, it's a really good point. Yeah, go ahead, Anne.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1467s)

I was just gonna say, yeah, the fact that you've got out as a family gives me hope that my children will get out as family. I won't give up because I know they've got married, but they need to know that it is possible still to get out.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1482s)

Yes, you get out and suddenly, oh my goodness, why didn't somebody tell us? You know, it's such a relief and such, so joyful really to get out and suddenly, you know, you're free.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1496s)

It's kind of like their description of of being converted, right? They talked about that in the church about being freshly converted and being a Christian all over again. And they talk about it, this amazing feeling, very euphoric and amazing. Well, I want the listeners that are inside the Brethren to know that that exact feeling is what it's like when you look back and realize how how amazing and how lucky you are [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1526s) be where you're at and to not be believing in these crazy, terrible that they tell you about burning in hell because you decide to think something differently.

Right, the sin that they pump into your head that it's bad to do this, but it's okay to do that. And it's bad to do this. And they, they're the ones that get to judge what's right and wrong. Okay, once you, once you drop that backpack off that's sitting on your back, it's the exact same feeling [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1556s) conversion, I guarantee you.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1558s)

Right. It is just a relief and that joy, and there's no other word for it. You know, if the burdens are gone, you kind of, oh, thank goodness, you know, we're out.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1569s)

And you let go of the guilt.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1572s)

Yeah, absolutely. I've never had it, never had guilt. I think people who are put out for whatever reason, they often end up with a kind of guilt complex and they think they must be wrong somewhere and they don't really take a while, a long time to get over it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1588s)

I struggled with that for years. You know, anytime something negative would be happened in my life or a relationship wouldn't work out or something, I would, these old, these pre-programmed thoughts would come in your mind. Is this because you're doing something wrong and bad, you know? And then thankfully, you know, I beat that, those thoughts, I overcame them by realizing no, but yeah, it's that is one of their...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1615s)

Biggest brainwashing tools they use, though, right? Like it is probably the toughest one to get over. I have to, I want to, I want to read something Peter Hart wrote this morning. This was in response to Fritz Penny's post. I'm going to read this. It was just such an incredible, I actually cried. It was just like so heartwarming. I mean, I know that this airs later, but today for us, this happened this morning.

Fritz Penny wrote;

“I've been asked to post this by someone not currently on Facebook who is in contact with people who are still in. They have asked about this and said it would help others to know the following. If you are currently in the Brethren and are thinking of leaving, please know you are not the only one. Many people you know are having similar thoughts, people possibly even in the same interchange or locality. You are far from the only person considering a different life to what you currently know.”

And I mean, that is so true. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1670s) mean, you're sitting here while we've just been into this conversation for half an hour, my phone is, it's just beeping off from insiders. So a new podcast went out today and it's just blinging. I'll have to go back and read them all. But anyhow, Peter Hart had a really incredible comment on to Fritz's post that I wanted to read out.

This is what he said. He said;

“For me, I felt that staying in there, I was supporting a system that was claiming to be Christian but was damaging the name of Christianity. Maybe you just want to live a normal life and people or a little voice is telling you it's the world you want. This is the statement, the Hales family are more worldly than 99% of the people out here. There must be a lot of people with questions, but [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1718s) won't speak about them. Of course, once you break free, you will feel so relieved and happy. I've never looked back.” 

But that post, that statement in there that the Hales family is 99% more worldly than, or more worldly than 99% of the people out here is so true. It is so true. How they run their family is like a cartel. It's like a mafia. It's not Christianity. It's the furthest thing from Christianity.

I hope, David, that this people hearing your story gives families, which I know that there are families in there questioning this all right now, can realize that it is, it is okay to get up, say, I'm done, move out. And I like, you're such a comedic, lighthearted person, I could sit and listen to your stories forever, because they make me giggle inside.

It's just, you are not someone who's been [completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1776s) all pressured down and you know, is not happy out here, right? You gain your freedom. It is such a, this morning it was just waking up and having this realization and it happens, I'm sure we all realize those waves that you get through. You wake up one morning and you're just like, holy crap, look, I have freedom of choice. I get to get up this morning and I get to choose, right? It's your choice.

And it's not saying that you're abandoning your [spirituality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1806s) or you're abandoning what your purpose is here. It's not that, but you have choice to eat wherever you want to eat. You have choice to be with whoever you want to be. You have all these choices that are stripped away from you when you're inside there.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1820s)

Absolutely. See, I love ships, so we've been all over the world cruising. We've been around the world twice completely. Oh wow. In Canada and grandchildren in Australia and the daughter in America. So we often have stopped off and a cruise and I think we've been to Australia 21 times so far. Wow. So we, yeah, you can do things. It's so [great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1850s) There's no countries left that I really want to go to. I've really been to every country I want to go to, except perhaps Antarctica. I'd quite like to go there, but not desperately.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1862s)

You've been all over the world. That's amazing, right? And like, I got an email back from my sister once years ago. It said something, I was like, oh, have you traveled at all? And she said something about, oh, I've been so lucky to travel. And she named a couple countries. And I realized, I was like, that's not traveling. She's going, staying in someone's house and eating food in their house, not at a restaurant, and then going to church and going back. If anything, maybe taking a drive downtown in the back [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1893s) a like 15 passenger van, you know, like that's not traveling. Don't tell me you travel.

Right? So that's, I'm so happy you did that. That's what I want to do with my life. I want to do more traveling and see more cultures because what it makes you realize is that you're like, oh goodness, the Brethren are such a teeny culture, such a just such a speck of dust. There's so many millions more cultures that actually have their own food, right? Have you ever heard [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1923s) Brethren food? No. What's their, what do they cook? No, there's a Brethren food. They don't invent anything. It's boring.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1930s)

Right. And then...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1931s)

I wanted to rant on something quick, changing the topic here really quick about the UBT seminar that came out today. It's happening...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1941s)

Right away. Yeah. Soon. It's pre-recorded.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1944s)

It was pre-recorded. So it was the speakers today were Gareth Hales, Dean Hales, Greg Hales, Charles Hales, Cameron Hales, and ready? Jim Admiraal. My little brother. All the Hales and an Admiraal. Little broski, if you're listening, buddy, I don't know. It must be dark up there because your head is so far up the Hales' asses. Holy shit.

And I guarantee you I know what the seminar is going to be. The seminar is going to be, Jim is going to describe how they sold their company recently for probably like a hundred million US, and how they're gonna give a bunch of it to the Hales’s and how that's gonna work out amazing for them. And you know, how giving to the Hales is is just such an amazing thing to do. And the more hundreds of millions you give to the Hales is, the higher your seat in heaven, apparently.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=1999s)

Yes, of course, because the poor old thieves are spending money to actually attend these seminars online, aren't they? Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2012s)

Yeah. And they freak out about us recording them, even though we are recording them. Of course, we're going to get the recordings. Yeah. But they freak out about it. It's because like, it's because anyone who listens to them in the normal world would laugh right away and be like, oh my goodness, this is such a pyramid scam. Like there's no way people are still believing this, is there? And it's like, yes, when you cut off people's internet and access to information and don't let them socialize with the outside world, they'll fall for pyramid scams really easily.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2040s)

Oh yes, absolutely. They're right for it. Yeah. In Australia, somebody gave me some thumb drives with all the, up to that moment, all the UBT seminars. I can watch them all. And also this, the Great Leaders videos that they spent, you know, hundreds of dollars on, they're all free.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2062s)

That's awesome. That's awesome. And they're garbage. Not not one of them has a business degree. You know, just because you're rich doesn't mean you know how to make other people rich, right?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2073s)

The sad thing about it is is the people at the bottom, like my kids, yeah, I've probably got massive mortgages still and they're believing their stuff and they're, you know, they're putting themselves in a bad situation financially or you know, and I remember what it was like whenever we were in there, you know, when I was...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2096s)

Yeah. I want to tell the Brethren listeners, if there's something there, what I'm doing in my life. So I'll tell you a little bit. I'm selling everything, everything I own, me and the girlfriend, everything, putting a couple things in boxes. That's it. You know why? Because having material things is shit. You know what's better than having a bunch of material stuff in a huge house? Experiences. Meeting people in other cultures. Meeting people of other religions, beliefs, everything. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2127s) true life, like David did, right? Traveling and seeing the world is going to bring you a lot more joy and excitement than having a massive house like the Hales' have.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2138s)

I think it's just the capability to be able to sit down with whoever you want and share that experience of love with, right? Like that's what is denied in your days. You're under so much fear that you don't get this experience of just having this full communion with somebody else that is pure, just like a human to human interaction that is just beyond anything that you can [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2168s) inside there.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2170s)

Because up to now, you've looked down on these people. You've had to have this kind of superior attitude. Can I pass on something that I know about, which you probably know about it, but I think it underlies most of what the Brethren, the contempt they feel for everybody who's non-Brethren. Yeah. And they used to use this phrase a lot, I don't know if they still do, about spoiling the Egyptians. Have you heard that? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2198s)

Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2199s)

You know where that comes from? Mm-mm. Understand? Okay, just briefly. When they escaped from Egypt, where they've been slaves for 400 years, they asked their hosts, the people they worked for, the slaves, could they borrow the household gods and take them to the desert to worship them? Now, this is the gold and the ornaments and stuff. And then they scarpered with them. It's all in the Bible.

They actually borrowed the gold and stuff from their masters, went out in the desert and then cleared off. Well, that's why Pharaoh thundered after them with the chariots and so on, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2232s) they spoiled Egyptians, spoiling in the sense of robbing them. And to the Brethren, that is actually a good thing to do. We'll spoil the Egyptians. So we get people like Rick's firm who killed a lot of people by giving them that dodgy, you know, air purification.

They have no conscience about it at all because they're non-people. People who aren't Brethren don't count as humans. They're there to be ripped off, and this permeates their thinking that everybody who's not Brethren is basically not worth anything.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2271s)

Yeah, and you really hear that through Terri Smith's story. And I mean, we had Hunter Briggs on this last time. This is in Maple Creek, same kind of thing. The way that they just get, I mean, they're treated like slaves. When Terri first came to me with her story, that's all I kept on saying, like, you were, you were their slave. They treated you like a slave. And that's why you were exposed. Like they, they didn't care what they did with you. They didn't care you were pregnant, right? Because they don't, they just don't care about them.

But yet they are very, very sly [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2302s) how they communicate to non-Brethren, right? They're very kind. They always have this beautiful face on, right? But it's behind the scenes of what happens behind that face, right? And I've had to explain to Maple Creek community, oh, well, they're kind. And I'm like, yeah, that's just, that is the face that they put on. But if you were put in a situation where they had to choose you or one of their members, they're not even look at you, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2330s)

Even a pedophile member they would, exactly. Yeah. They, that's what I've talked about on here before is, and it comes down to egotism, right? It's, we're better than them. We are chosen people. Now, when you take a child, okay, and in my opinion, all children are born atheists and then we brainwash them, but that's just my opinion. But the child's born, right? And then you tell it just from from being a toddler that it's special. It was [chosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2361s) above all other children in the world and then expect that to not pass on into older adult life. Of course it is, right? This superiority thinking of just, and it's the same thing with how they treat the environment, right? Yeah, we're getting saved soon, everyone else is going to hell, so it doesn't matter, right?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2381s)

It's true that attitude. We're going back to Terri a minute. When you learn that Terri is four foot something and she worked clearly, she worked like a, you know, really hard. She was such a good worker. That's why they looked after her to to a degree. But then, you know, the way they treated it was disgusting. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2405s)

Yeah, yeah. And I mean, she still struggles every single day trying to overcome what she went through in there. Like it's just, it's just not right.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2416s)

Doesn't dare leave the house, you know, she's really scarred, isn't she, poor girl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2421s)

Yeah, yeah. She's gone through a lot. She has gone through a lot. I just, I mean, I'm hoping something comes out of her podcast she did, that you know, there's some sort of accountability because we know, we all know that it is the community's voices that holds anything judicial into account, right? Like it's not, I don't believe it's our police force and it's our judicial system that holds accountability. It doesn't always happen like that. It has to be the community's voice that holds people accountable. And that's what I hope comes out [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2451s) all of this.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2452s)

Any other church though would have kicked Alan Drever out long ago. Oh, absolutely. What I mean, and hearing that first podcast that Cheryl did would have been like, oh my goodness, you are gone out, you know. And no, they they just, yeah, you must be a liar. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2471s)

Get the man some help, right? If you don't even do that, then go and put him into some treatment center, right? They go and put him into something where he can't just be out walking the streets, right? Like it's...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2482s)

A danger to the public. He's a danger to the public. Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2489s)

I Remember my father saying the Brethren are the only church that can deal with evil. I remember he's quite strong about this. They're the only church that can deal with evil because everybody else is all wishy and woolly and so on. But the assembly discipline, you know, will deal with evil. Clearly they don't, because Alan Drever clearly needs to be disciplined or to be helped or something or or prevented from continuing.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2517s)

 But I think the fact, I think the fact that they don't brings up this really big question. What does he know that they're scared of?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2525s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2526s)

You know, what's going on in there that he knows that they won't deal with them because they're scared of him? Because that's the only reason they would protect him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2534s)

And I can answer that question, but it's another two-hour podcast. But yeah, and that's why it is. It is because of what he knows and it is because of who else knew, right? Like that's that's the thing is that he's, he is a very diseased root that they've had to be covering up for, I mean, way before my time, you know, like it's, yeah, that's the sad thing. Anyhow, you're going to say something.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2565s)

Yeah, go ahead, ladies. Was it me? Oh, well, I was just thinking about something how even after all this stuff, we still get, you know, messages and we hear about what they say about us, right? And that we're all liars and that, go live your life. Then, you know, this is something. And I remember hearing these things before I got confined, my parents, my family, people knew that I was going to be leaving. I wasn't attending church anymore and they would say these lines, stuff [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2595s) you know, if you're going to leave, go live your life, don't speak against the church, you know, just live your life.

Right? 

And they would say things like, if you are speaking, it's, you know, if you say something against the church, you're obviously missed something if you're talking about it so much about these these podcasts. And my response is, my life is so good that I can talk about it. If my life was crap and and I was really realizing that the Brethren were right and that my life is [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2626s) shit on the outside, I don't think I'd be podcasting talking. And I don't think I would, I think I'd be hiding and, oh goodness, they were right, you know.

So I just wanted to address those accusations that you know, and honestly, to those people, listen up, if I can take two hours out of my week to expose crimes against children and to help people maybe maybe drop those chains of [brainwashing,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2656s) then I'll gladly do it. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2658s)

And I think, and you can speak on this on why, I mean, the landing pad that you are creating, you you are such a freaking inspiration. Like the landing pad that you are creating for your children and your grandchildren, wow. Like, I mean, could you imagine not doing what you're doing?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2675s)

Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I have to do it. Yeah, or my children. I would be failing my children if I didn't do it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2685s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2686s)

And you know, what they've got to realize in there is that this system is creating human beings like Alan Drever, like my ex-husband. You know, I'm not excusing his behavior, but that's the sort of monsters that this system creates because of what they teach. Yeah. And that's so so wrong.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2710s)

Yeah, well, don't teach, yeah, not educating than probably at all.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2716s)

Yeah, that's exactly, and it's just...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2718s)

Yeah, I could, I could never sit back and go to sleep at night knowing what I know now and knowing that I have nieces in there, knowing that there's people in there that do not have a voice. Like how, it's like literally having a burning building across the street from you on fire and there's children screaming. You bet your butt I'm gonna find a way to get in there and get those children out. I just would. And any human being with compassion and a heart is going to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2748s) the same thing.

I mean, we all have good lives. We all have good lives that we're enjoying, but that's not going to stop us from creating a movement and being an activist on something that has to change. I mean, our, in my opinion, the 30 years that I've been out be in silence has only given Bruce Hales extreme power. And the only way that you can stop that power from growing more is by everyone's [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2778s) of a sudden standing up and being like, hey, this is what's going on inside there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Does not mean that we don't have good lives because we do have good lives. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2789s)

Yeah, yeah. Ask yourself if you're in there right now, ask yourself if you're truly happy. Are you really super satisfied and happy with your life? You know, are you just completely content and full of joy after every meeting? Do you hear these people get up and speak and talk about things that are just universal love and acceptance? Do they talk about nature and [beauty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2819s) No, they sure don't, do they? Right? They they preach evil and death and destruction and infinite torture chambers and, ah, scary, right?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2836s)

Gossip too. I mean, that's what the Brethren feast on. Now you can probably relate to this, Lane. In the circular Brethren meeting rooms, you know, the city rooms, how much eye contact went on all the time across the rows? Tons, tons, you know, yeah, lots and lots of secrets. Oh, that's true. Yeah, there was, you'd send messages, you'd wink, you'd laugh about certain things. The whole time, and you could watch it and get [involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2874s) in it, and you're thinking, hang on a minute, you know, this isn't right. This is, you know, I may like that person, but she shouldn't be giving me the eye.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2889s)

I don't think people that were listening to Nelson Mandela were pulling these kind of things. I don't think people that were sitting in front of the Gettysburg Address in front of Abraham Lincoln were joshing around and joking. Oh, what are you talking about? You know, because the subject is not interesting. The subject they're talking about is not captivating and nice. It is scary, fear filled and uneducated as [fuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2919s) Excuse my language, but it really is very uneducated. They're on, they're uneducated about their own book, okay? Don't get me, it's it's that, but anyway.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2930s)

That that you say about eye contact across the room, that that was basically brother and dating.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2937s)

Yeah, it was. That's so true. That's so true, wasn't it? Every meeting, you know, you knew who was, who were you gonna catch in the eye and you could see, yeah, brothers were at it too and you think...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2952s)

I used to wait outside in the foyer to see where the boy who I liked at a certain time was gonna sit to make sure I got opposite him. And however many times he looked at your smile, that it was how much he liked you. And that's exactly how me and my husband dated in a three-day meeting. That was all it was. It was a look across the room. I went, we were bored in the meeting, we looked at each other, we thought, yeah, you're okay. We had one conversation [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2983s) he gives me, yeah, and he gave me a 10 pound note that said, love you always and forever. We had one conversation after some miles across the meeting. That's how it's done in there, like...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=2998s)

It's it's probably sounds nuts to outsiders, but that's literally how it's done. It is, that's how it's done. That was the thrill.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3008s)

One sister in Manchester who was chronic at this, she had six kids, but she was still good looking and she used to see how many visiting brothers she could hook. And he asked her out and she said, well, I do have six children, you know, and that was her, that was her life. She spent the whole time trying...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3034s)

You gotta entertain yourself somehow, sorry.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3035s)

Yeah, absolutely. In the last few years, in the last few years that I was in there, I did that too. You know, I was so unhappy and there was certain young brothers, they were unmarried at the moment that I was like 20 years older. There were certain young brothers who were also bored and it was, yeah, it was a bit of a highlight at the end of the day for me.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3058s)

But think of what's funny is think of how innocent that is, really, just giving a look to someone across a room, right? But in that situation, in the Exclusive Brethren, that is literally the dating world because they just restrain everything so much. No male and female could be like, hi, I kind of like this girl. I'm going to go for a walk with her for a couple hours. Absolutely not. Not allowed. No. Everything has to be supervised.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3088s)

It never happens elsewhere. I've been all sorts of gatherings. It never happens except in the Exclusive Brethren. That it's absolutely chronic in there and because it is too is it zero trust.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3099s)

Yeah, yeah. I was going to say that because it creates this, they don't trust them. It almost makes those young people do something that maybe they shouldn't do, you know, go further than they, because there's all this suspicion around it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3115s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3116s)

You know, I remember, I remember when my son just over 10 years ago decided to marry a girl. He'd only met her once, spoken to her on the phone once. But anyway, I remember her mom phoning me up and saying, I just want to make sure that you're absolutely clear that we are a no physical contact family. Christmas of 2012, Christmas of 2012, I took Clint, my eldest, on Christmas Eve, we flew over to Peterborough and yeah, we went for a walk on Christmas day. Clint and his wife to be were just in front of us, a few meters in front of us, not touching, and he proposed her.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3171s)

Wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3173s)

First proper face-to-face meeting. That's the way it works in there for anybody that doesn't understand.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3181s)

If you're in there and you're listening, I want to tell you about this amazing thing. If you can get it onto your phone without Streamline 3, it's called Tinder. Boy, are you in for a surprise.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3197s)

Well, well, me and me and my current partner, Dan, that's where we met on Tinder in New Zealand.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3205s)

Me and my girlfriend met on Hinge. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3211s)

Oh, that's funny.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3214s)

While we're making fun of them also, I can't stop making fun of their music app, Trove. It's so bad. I heard some of it. I've heard some of the music on there. Oh my goodness. It's just, you can tell that they've never heard the songs they're playing. And the songs they make up themselves, the words are just like, just about boring. I don't know, just loving life, making money, going to church, you know, like...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3243s)

Like, oh, how exciting. That that reminds me of the sort of the early days when when music was allowed. Do you remember the little, all those little recording things that we used to have?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3257s)

They plug them into the car.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3259s)

MP3 players. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3262s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3262s)

So Scott, my second son, he he was, he got crafty. He was buying them up on eBay and selling them at a profit. But anyway, he had all, he had all this music on the MP3 player, you know, which we believed was brethren music. I remember turning up at his workplace with his lunch or something for him with Alan Jackson music blaring out of the car. And he goes, Mom, you do realize that's Alan Jackson, not Brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3291s)

That's funny.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3298s)

Oh my looks, my looks I got in meeting were just from the priest. And I knew, I knew by how fast Morris Hope's jaw was going on. He was down onto the side. Oh yeah, yeah. I could tell by how fast it was twitching on how close I was to a priestly visit. And if he was making contact with the other two priests, I'm like, oh darn it is tonight, isn't it? Sure enough, you get home in 10 minutes, we'd like to come over and you know...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3322s)

Oh, that's so funny. You could literally tell.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3327s)

It was his jaw would, it would, you know, it would lead up to it. By the by the end of his jaw would just be going like, it's really going tonight. And then he'd be arching his eyes to everybody and I'm like, oh yeah, tonight it's it's happening tonight. I know what's happening tonight.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3343s)

I used to, I used to wear once in a while pink shirts to meeting and there's these older sisters would cry, would literally just look at just their tears on their faces, just shaking their heads, just couldn't understand why I would wear. And the more they, the more they, you know, got mad about it, I obviously the more I wear them. And they were like, is he gay? Is he not gay? We don't know.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3374s)

Oh gee, the things, eh? Let me tell you one more, one more funny story. The church we still go to, okay, a few years after we joined, it was the centenary, like 100 years since it was founded. So I'm looking around in the foyer, they put up all these old pictures and there's all these old sepia photographs and I'm sort of looking at them. The guy behind me says, look at that typical Brethren tin tabernacle. I said, what? [Was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3404s) this a Brethren church? Oh, yes. I said, didn't you know?

They changed the name 50 years ago because of the disgrace of the Exclusives. It's nothing like a Brethren church. There was a pastor and everything. That's what it started 100 years, 140 years ago now. But that was a joke because really, you know, if I'd known that it started off as a Brethren, I wouldn't have gone near it because anything to do with the Brethren was rubbish.

And I now realize, actually, as somebody pointed out the other day, the Brethren think they're the part of this mainstream, you know, what they say, even the name Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is such an, it's so wrong because they all their lives they've decried the Plymouth Brethren, you know, and mocked them and so now they've taken hold of the name to to bolster up their shaky reputation, you know, it's just ridiculous.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3464s)

Yeah, they definitely, I mean, we've said this many times, Bruce knows what he's doing. He knows how to create the face that he needed, right? And he's very good at it. The thing is is that, but eventually lies just don't hold a foundation anymore. And I mean, you get what we're getting now, right? Where it's just, the people are seeing through it, right? And it is, it will happen. I have no doubt in my mind it will happen. It just is going to be a slow, it will be a slow crumble.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3495s)

It's a glass house and we're throwing stones at it. That's what I like. You know, no, but it can't, you, when you have something based on fear and control and everything like that, once the, even the internet, right, it's just a matter of time before information leaks into the church or the cult, right? Like they can't hide information forever. And these people, the younger generation in there is going to start looking things up for themselves, going to start questioning this stuff. Be like, what is this really? Why do I need to give a hundred million to Bruce Hales again? You know, what does that have to do with my Christian faith? Like what, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3536s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3537s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it might take some police action too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3542s)

Yeah, by the sounds of my phone this morning, it is a busy day inside there. I have got a lot to go through.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3556s)

Well, well done, Cheryl for doing it. Yeah, that's what I mean.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3559s)

Very much. I am so grateful for everybody who has come forward and everybody who has reached out a hand. I'm so grateful and said yes to coming on today. We just want to, I mean, if there's so many of us doing this, right? Like there's just so many and I think it's just, it's nice to have a universal face here and yeah, it just, it needs to happen. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3584s)

Sharing stories.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3585s)

You're you're doing really well. Thank you for all that. Yeah, yeah. And coming on, David.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3590s)

We really appreciate it. Yeah, we...

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3592s)

So appreciated you coming on. Thank you so much for having us. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3597s)

It was very light-hearted and you know, we're just grateful. Hopefully it inspires a bunch of more families to realize that they can get out and wear a smile like you're wearing.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3608s)

Yeah, yeah. You don't have to, you see, a lot of them aren't Christians anyway in there. They don't really believe anything. But some of them are and they probably hang on because, you know, they think it's really outside when you leave. They think you've gone into the world. That's their big thing, isn't it? My brother, I met him in the car park a few years later and he said, you just wanted the world, didn't you? I said, no, Ted, that is not the situation. We haven't gone out for the world. We've gone out away from the Brethren because we didn't think it was, it was genuine. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3638s) it isn't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3639s)

Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3640s)

He said, you you've got television, don't you? I said, yeah, television. But I said, you have to, you have to control what you watch on television. Yeah, absolutely. Everything else, you use your own discretion. Yeah. You walk into one, you have the choice. You can look at the top shelf with all the news. You can study them, you know, it's there. You can look at it. Don't have to. You can just go on my newspaper or a packet of, you know, sweets or something. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3671s) have to use your own discretion, your own judgment. So yeah, television's full of rubbish. You don't have to use it for that. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3678s)

It has that, it has that really cool knob on it that turns it off.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3682s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3682s)

Absolutely. And you know, that's a problem. A lot of the Brethren think that they need Streamline 3 and they need a filter to filter out the bad things. It's called self-control. Yes. If you don't have any self-control, then you might need to be locked up because we use self-control in our daily lives. And if you don't have any and you look up something and then feel guilty about it, well, that's a you problem.

The other thing I want to address is about how the Brethren do say that about going off [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3714s) the world, going into the world. Excuse me, what other planet are we living on currently? Where are you going? There is nowhere to actually go. Someone that leaves the Brethren doesn't even leave. They just stop attending a building, a compound with a bunch of weirdos that scream fear. You don't go into the world and you don't leave the Brethren. You actually just stop attending. I know we like saint leaving and we do leave that [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3744s) of thinking and that their whole system. But when they say that you go into the world, where exactly am I going?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3755s)

And you know what, there's so many people that speak like you did, David, where honestly, what did you do? You walked away from there and walked in to true Christianity, right? And Carman talks about the same thing. It's not, it's like, it's exactly what Peter Hart said this morning on Facebook, how they are more worldly than 99% of people out here. You're literally in the world and you now get to leave into something that is far more or less harsh, right? It's, yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3785s)

And by putting...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3787s)

Like, sorry, go on, go on.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3789s)

If I can just give a plug for God, I think to be an intellectually honest atheist takes more faith than I've got because there's so much evidence that there is a God. You've only to look around you and if you believe that creation just happened and if you believe Darwin...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3808s)

Yes, Darwin, that is, that is a fact. I'm sorry, I'm going to argue with you on that one. Science makes iPhones.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3819s)

Okay, science and evolution, Neanderthals existed, Homo erectus existed, Homo sapiens came later. This is a fact. The world is millions of years old, not thousands.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3836s)

I think that's another, another podcast.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3837s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we won't get into that, Lane, but cordially disagree. But actually talking about going into the world, the most famous scripture of all, God so loved the world. God actually loves us, believe it or not. God loves us, all of us, atheists and all. And he's there and it's incredible when you realize God is very, very real and I would say...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3863s)

Something on even on that too, right? Like the Brethren like to say that you turn your back on God. Um, excuse me, don't you also believe that God is everywhere? So how could I turn my back on something that's omnipresent? Wouldn't he just be in front of me again?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3879s)

Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yep, you got it. Yeah. Thanks, Cheryl. Thanks all of you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3886s)

Thank you, David. Thank you so much. You know what, this is why we have a diverse group on here because it's super important. It is really important to have a voice for every level of faith. Everybody needs to have a voice.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3901s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3902s)

Right? It just, anyhow, thank you guys so much. Thanks, David for joining us and thanks, Anne for coming on and being a part of that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3909s)

And thank David's sweet wife for attending. Yes, her smile just makes my day.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3916s)

She is gorgeous. Yeah, she is. Let me show you what, let me show you what she was like when we first met in 19... Oh wow, gorgeous. Look at that. Yeah, like that hair. It's actually just the same now. Yes.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3934s)

Gorgeous.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdckoFPdyBA&t=3942s)

Well, hopefully we can maybe get your your daughters on and extend the story a little bit. But yes, okay, thank you everyone for joining us. Much love to everybody.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
