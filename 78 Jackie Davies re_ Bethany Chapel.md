## Summary

In a small hamlet just outside Newtown in Wales stands an old chapel with a graveyard in its grounds. Despite the graves being old, they are still treasured by locals who have family past buried there.
How would you feel if you went to lay flowers on your grandparents' grave and it was no longer there? Imagine the shock of the locals when one day in July they found some of the headstones had been removed, graves had been dug over, and a gravel drive had been laid on top of them.
A local resident, Jackie Davies, describes the campaign she has led to expose the inhumane behavior's of the new owners of the site - Dolafon Gospel Hall Trust, a trust belonging to the PBCC/Exclusive Brethren. Jackie also talks about the unanswered questions of building plans not being available and planning permission being passed without complete transparency of process
‘Even when we’re wrong we’re right’ is a phrase used by the PBCC, and the attitude of disdain Jackie was subjected to by members of the PBCC certainly upheld this arrogant statement.
Will the PBCC do the right thing by offering a full apology and rectifying the graveyard to its original state, or will their entitlement shine through and just do the bare minimum to avoid publicity? Join us to find out

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

Jackie Davies is speaking as a concerned relative of the deceased in the Bethany Chapel graveyard, not in her capacity as a town councillor.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=16s)

Hey everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm joined by my friends Abi, Anne, and Ross, and we have a very special guest with us, Jackie Davies, who lives near Newtown. Now, there's recently been some controversy over a property bought by the Brethren near where Jackie lives, and we thought we'd start this podcast with a short video clip from the BBC News that gives some explanation as to what we'll be discussing this evening.

### [**TV Presenter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=44s)

“Police are investigating after an access road to a car park was built on part of a graveyard at a Powys chapel. A Christian group that owns the building says it has planning permission to restore it to become a place of worship again. But relatives of people buried at Bethany Chapel near Newtown say they weren't consulted and are angry and upset over the works. Craig Duggan reports.

A grade 2 listed chapel in a small Powys hamlet. But for people with relatives buried here, Hodley is now the focus of major concern. The building is being renovated. A new access road and car park have been built on part of the old graveyard. Headstones were moved to make way for the road. It's thought a number of graves are now under it. Relatives of the deceased say they weren't consulted. The great-grandparents of Jackie's husband were laid to rest here. She's spoken with other distressed families.

Relatives have been in touch with us, horrified that this has happened to their loved ones who've been laid to rest here. They've come with flowers. They just have thought they didn't know what to do. It's just there's an insensitivity of what's happened here. And they feel nobody cares.

A gravestone in memory of William and Martha White has been moved. In a statement, their descendants said they're shocked and deeply upset by the work. They're calling for reassurance that their loved ones' remains have not been disturbed or taken away. The owners of the chapel, the Dolafon Trust, say they're aware of concerns about the restoration work, but they're adhering meticulously to the planning consent granted by Powys Council.

The Trust adds it's worked closely with the Council and other authorities to ensure the plans are delivered sensitively and [appropriately.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=144s) Last year, a Powys planning officer approved an application from the Trust for a change in land use to create the car park and vehicle access. Consent was granted despite opposition from Powys Highways Department and the Community Council. Elwyn Vaughan, the Plaid Cymru Group Leader on the Council, says the case raises many questions. 

The grave is under the road here, so the road being built right through the graveyard, showing total lack of respect, and their fundamental questions about the applications, that [last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=175s) application described a place of agricultural land, which is totally misleading, to say the least.

Did the planning officer actually have a site visit here? I understand not. Why not? Dyfed-Powys Police says it's investigating a report of criminal damage, and Powys Council is looking into a breach of planning conditions. The chapel owners say their priority is to be good neighbours and they aim to complete the restoration with respect and compassion to re-establish the chapel as a place of worship.”

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=204s)

Thank you. So Jackie, that's the little chapel that you know as Bethany Chapel, but I believe your locals call it Hodley Chapel. Take us back to the beginning and what happened and how you found out that the drive had been built there.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=222s)

Well, I got told about this about a year ago, and because of it being a graveyard, I was told by relatives that they intended on putting a drive over the graves, or around the graves I should say, to make access to the back of the chapel. I knew a bit about planning and I said that wouldn't happen. A lot of my colleagues said it can't happen, won't happen, because of it being such a sensitive issue. You'd have to get the Home Office involved, you'd have to get various other organizations to do such, you know, it just isn't going to happen.

Right, so a year later, I got a call off my husband saying, "You think you need to come down and have a look at what's happened at Mum's." I said, "Right." So I went down and to my horror, there used to be a 50-foot, maybe 70-foot long and seven-foot high mature hedge. Now this is now mid-July, well I say mid-July, 20-something of July, 25th actually, and the hedge was gone.

Now, I was at my mother-in-law's two days before and I heard the birds nesting. We knew hedgehogs were in there, we knew that there were pigeon nests, and we also knew that there were other birds' nests in there, and this was actually in the report by the Heritage officer as well when the plans were going ahead, and these were the concerns they [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=313s) about just about the hedge, this was.

Anyway, so this hedge has been completely ripped out, all been done within a day, and it's huge. And behind the hedge, I think you may have a photograph, and behind the hedge is a load of rubble, which then I was told that the rubble, and I mean is mounds and mounds, have obviously been dug up and everything, of soil and stone. And I don't know if you actually got that one there [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=343s), I can't see it, but anyway, it is on the site page. And it was shocking. There was a digger there and we realized that they'd actually done it all over the graves, and it was like mounds and mounds of soil, and it was horrific to be honest to see.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=361s)

So just to clarify for people, you live near the chapel, but am I right in understanding your mother-in-law, did you say, lives right next to it?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=369s)

They're the opposite. So if you look at some of the photos, I said there was a seven-foot high, could have been higher, hedge, so you could not see over that hedge to see that chapel. The pictures on here now, if you actually look at, say, the last ones I think you've got there, you can actually see that would be from my mother-in-law's front door straight across there. You see the chapel, you see everything. That is literally a view.

It's only very, it's a B-lane which is a very, very small lane. It wouldn't be big. If you actually look at the plans as well, the plans aren't drawn to scale, so they should never have been approved. I've proven this, and they should never have been approved anyway. So this is obviously something else we've taken up with the planning officer.

So we contacted our local councillor at the time. We contacted a couple of councillors, actually. Our local councillor didn't seem too interested, couldn't quite understand why. Later we've worked it all out. So we've got another councillor to come down who is a part of planning, and he came and he was horrified at what he's seen. He came, and the next day he came straight down. He couldn't believe what we were looking at. He said it should have come to a planning committee, which is what normally happens. It obviously hadn't gone to planning committee.

We found out that one lady in the offices at the planning and her supervisor had signed it off for it to go through. They obviously signed off, apparently, the first set of plans, which you can see there, [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=470s) it sort of like goes round the back of the chapel.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=475s)

Sorry Jackie to interrupt, but just to recap on the plan on the left of the screen, the red line going up to the side, the narrow end of the chapel, not the end where presumably the altar was, that shows it going past the graveyards and not disturbing them.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=493s)

Yeah, well that's the plan that went in, and if you look at it, you think that would be the case. However, actually, again, that is not drawn to scale in relation to the fact that the little, there's a small like shed-looking thing there, but a garage, can you see it at the front of the entrance? Yes, that is actually a massive double garage, huge, and it takes up the whole of that area. And it actually comes out to really where the line of the red is at the front, as you saw if you were going through the gates. So it's already causing a visible [issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=523s) to start with. Okay, it's not theirs, it's not their property. It's owned by somebody in the cottages, it's not actually theirs. And then the red line that goes around it, if you like, yes, that hedge in there actually also belongs to the garage, not to them, not to the Brethren. So basically, why this plan's been drawn is it's taking other people's land and it shouldn't have done.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=547s)

So to clarify, if you look at the plan on the right, you can see the red line going across the graveyard, and then the dotted line is the original one on the left, even though it's not to scale. And then also you're pointing out around the garage in the bottom right, instead of being a square around the garage, there's been land cornered off and the hedge cut down. So extra land has almost been claimed. Is that, have we understood that correctly?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=572s)

That's really, that's how they've done it for extra land, claimed by from this other person's who owns it. But they didn't, when you actually go and have a look at it, they haven't claimed it, they haven't actually used it. So I mean, they've just, it's very false, if I'm honest.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=589s)

Can I just recap on something else? You, as I understand it, have some knowledge of planning. Because you said a year beforehand you heard this might happen and your reaction was, "Oh, it would never happen because they're graves." What was your understanding of what the law says to protect graves, however old they are?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=606s)

Well, you'd have to contact the Home Office anyway, because obviously the burials site, you know, because of it with the graves and everything. But also what I did know, and I was aware of, now in our area, or I don't know where this is all throughout the UK, but certainly in Powys, if highways have objected, then normally, I'd say 95% of the time, it won't get passed.

Now, I know, and that was my argument, to think about highways had objected, Cadw had objected, and so had, who are they, yeah, Cadw are the history, if you like. I can't think what the short is, I can't remember what it's called now, but it's all to do with archaeology. Okay, so they're the history archaeologists, yeah, yeah. So they actually, they objected because what we got told, and it's in the paperwork, that there are two listed graves in the graveyard. Now, we don't know as of yet what two listed graves they are.

So when I turned up and seen the mess that was there, the horror, it was horrific. It was [absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=681s) horrific to see. When I said that, and I went to the contractor at the time, and I said, "Could you tell me which two are the listed grave headstones?" He said, "I didn't know there was any." That's it, there we are. Oh wow. Oh, that's what I, that was what I came up with. That's what I got called to, and I was absolutely horrified. I couldn't even explain, it was sickening. It was beyond sickening. You looked, and you know, and knowing that there's people under that.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=710s)

So looking at that picture there, if you describe to our listeners and viewers, that's what you saw. Where in relation to that mound of earth and the gravel did you know the graves to be?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D720s)

Oh, under it, under it. So that's directly over some of the graves. Yeah, there's one, two, three, I could say there's at least three on, three to my right if I'm looking at it now. So more to the hedge side, there's at least three there. There's, then, then of course, where this grass verge is, where there's obviously the graveyard is that there, that's where you've got the ones where you've seen the stakes going in.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=751s)

Yes, we've got some pictures of those, I think.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=753s)

So yeah, there we are. So their bodies are lying under that as well, because, wow, right. So I think there's two of them there, there's one just a bit further which you can't see that's actually got tucked away, but that again was there.

And you know, when I, I must tell you a story on this. When I obviously confronted Peter Roberts about this, who's the Brethren in Plymouth Brethren, and I said to him, it was quite shocking really. I said, "Why have you dug up over the graves?" He said, "There's no graves under here." I said, "No, I, I said, sorry, I said there is graves." "No, no, there's no graves." He said, "This is the truth now, this is a man telling me in front of witnesses, you know, councillors, we had the minister from the Welsh Assembly there as well, and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=800s) the County Councillor, so another one."

And we were standing there and I said, "No, there is." So I walked across, around, to show Peter Roberts that these are graves. He went marching across to the, I don't know where he was going to be fair, but he sort of marched off and I said, "Excuse me, could you come here please?" And he came back, he didn't like me asking it, but I said, we stood at the foot of this grave and I said, and he went to walk across, I said, "No, I said, this is somebody's burial site. You [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=830s) going to walk on somebody's burial site. You've put a stake in somebody's head, if you like."

And do you know what, it was like, it was interesting. He didn't believe he'd done it. He didn't believe it was there. It was like, honestly now, it was completely oblivious to what we were trying to say. I didn't know what religion the Brethren were, I've got to be honest about you. I didn't, we have, you know, there, we're in a village and some of their children go to the village school and up until they're about [seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=860s) or eight, I can't remember, I think seven, and yes, it's seven. And our children have mixed with the children, you know, they have, and I've never had a problem with them. You know, I just thought, "Well, that's their, that's their religion, that's their choice."

That's, you know, they've seen private people, and I said, "What religion are you?" And he said, "We're Christians." I said, "Well, you do, I do." I said, "Well, well, do you think it's right for Christians to have done this to [Methodist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=891s) Christians?" Because let's be fair now, years ago, 100 years ago or whatever, 50 years ago, it was very quite strong religion, you know, the chapel religion was very, very strong. Yeah, but he still couldn't, it was like he just couldn't grasp what we were saying to him. He just couldn't.

So as I said, I think he did get his back up, he didn't like it. He asked me, "What do you want me to do about it?" And I just said, like, well, everybody wanted, we wanted it restored. And he just [nodded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=921s) his head. And then he started, when he first got out of his car, he comes shooting down to me, and as I said, there was councillors there and my mother-in-law, and Alan, whose ancestors are actually under there, his grandparents. And he comes shooting down, he said, "I suggest you lot go, go and stand outside Powys County Council, Powys County planning offices, not here. Go on, move on." Words to that effect, but he basically did tell us all to move on.

And my husband's, or my [mother-in-law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=951s) was absolutely horrified. My husband said he's been born and bred there, and he said, "You don't talk to people like that." It was like they owned the place, they owned it. It was, it was actually a public road we were on, and it's like my mother-in-law's house. It was, it was the rudeness. It was their right, and what they were doing was right in their mind, and they didn't seem to understand that it's not right. It wasn't acceptable. It was sacred land and it was our people.

I said to him, I [said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=981s) "At the end of the day," I said, "we've left you alone. Nobody bothers. We let you get on. You build your big churches. You're building your houses, which to be fair, a lot of them haven't got local needs on them, which let's be fair, most people around here if you went to build a house in the in the rural area, you'd have to put local needs of some sort, but they, funny enough, don't have to, well, don't seem to have to."

They build these big, you know, a mile down the road, if that, there's a massive big church being built there. They've got one in Sarn, which Abi would know about, and then [they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1011s) got one in Newtown. You know, they're not short of these buildings. Why they want a little chapel like that, which they've absolutely gutted by the way, and we don't really know where the pulpit is, which is supposed to stay within that chapel. It's been, it's pretty horrific to be honest. The whole lot of it is, is shocking to be fair.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D1033s)

So I know Pete Roberts personally, I lived at his house for a while. I completely understand what you would have been [met](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1041s) with in terms of when he's, when someone's up against him, he doesn't like it and he gets quite angry quite quickly. They have been looking for a what they call a subdivisional room. So they've got city rooms, which is, which is the big one in the center of Newtown, like next to McDonald's or near McDonald's by the river.

And then they have subdivisional rooms throughout the outskirts of Newtown. So they go to the main meeting room for their main meetings and then they'll have prayer meetings, supper meetings, 3:15s or 5:15s at subdivisional rooms, and that's why they've wanted these dotted round so they don't have to use the main room. This is what happens all over the Brethren [community.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1102s)

So they've, they've been in, I know in Sarn and Kerry, they've been having suppers in the house for years, years and years and years, and then more Brethren are moving out to those areas. I don't know where that is in relation to Hodley, because obviously I was in Kerry, Newtown area when I lived there.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D1123s)

Yeah, because where you know where Hodley is? It's between Kerry, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1132s) the room in Kerry and Abermule. I know where it is. Yeah, and there is the Simpsons, one of the Simpsons' sisters lived there. She's like a crossroads and they actually lived there, they live in, they actually started to buy the houses in that area. There's only several, but they've sort of dotted and started to take over a bit, yes.

So you know where the railway crossroads is? That's it, that's where the other one's been built, yes, yeah, that's it. And they've got, and they've got some, I think they've also, somebody said they've got four houses being built around there as well, probably, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1170s) is, yeah. But you know, I mean, it's like they've put a steel frame, they're doing that building, and that again is something they don't normally allow. Do you know what I mean? Planning don't normally allow it, but where there's money, there's power, unfortunately.

To be fair, we, it's something we're all establishing now. We all can see what's going on now. A lot of us are open, you know, we can see. I mean, we know, I mean, what frustrated us was the woman who signed [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1200s) the plans, and then she had to have a supervisor sign off, and he's like head of planning. He's a nightmare to be fair. He is her brother-in-law. Oh, yeah. So the Brethren will have done them a favor, I think, yes, along the line. Yeah, so that they're returning.

I mean, now obviously, you've got the, yeah, so, yeah, that's right. So then I obviously started to find out more and more about the Brethren and what they do and what [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1230s) stand for and who is behind the Brethren as well. Now, you know, obviously I've worked out the county councillor of that area is actually Conservative, but he backed off big time. Now, obviously, I don't, I got some information and found out that obviously the Brethren, during the pandemic or COVID, whatever you want to call it, they got granted a certain amount of money from the Tory government.

And then [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1261s) happens is for the charity, because they're charitable status, and then so much of that money gets given back as donations. So I started to work it out. Our AM, Russell George, didn't get involved. Our MP, Craig Williams, didn't get involved. And I'll be honest with you, I joined them about four months ago because I was going to stand as a county councillor to get in. I tried it last year, year before, I was an independent, didn't work out. So I went and I joined them.

And I [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1291s) the day I realized they weren't going to do anything against the Brethren, and they weren't, I quit. I resigned. They didn't like that because they just know I am quite a fighter, quite challenging. I have been, you know, I do fight for people's rights and I'm very vocal on certain things because I'm not happy with the way things are. I'm certainly not with the way Powys is.

However, they didn't get involved. I couldn't understand it. The only person, the only councillor that would get involved [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1321s) Plaid, which is Elwyn Vaughan, and to be fair, he put his neck on the line and he has really, really tried. And we went to, we knew we had to start the campaign straight away. So that's what we did. We set up the page, the Facebook page. I obviously, I'm familiar to the area, so my husband, as I said, there's lots of locals we knew, so they all came on board.

We wanted it restored. That, yeah, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1351s) a picture of, that's that one born on the far end. Then there's my mother-in-law, there's the minister from the Welsh government, myself, and that gentleman's Alan Jones, whose family are under the grave, you know, it was, it was literally disturbed. And that was the day Peter Roberts came down, straight out of his car and straight at us. You know, we're hardly a bunch of hooligans, were we? Do you know what I mean? But he really did, it was quite, yeah, yeah.

I wouldn't want to be on my own with him as a woman because I think he's very intimidating. Well, I would because I can deal with it, but I'd feel so, I can imagine being very overpowering to women, certainly. The way he spoke to me, just, he didn't have no respect for me. He didn't, I was nobody. But yeah, you know, it's just how it was. He was quite, not very nice, really.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1403s)

So when you started the campaign, that was about summer of this year, once you realized what had happened to the graves and the hedge and so on, how much at that point when you started the campaign did you know about the Brethren and the Gospel Hall Trust? I think it was Dolafon Gospel Hall Trust who had bought the site.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1424s)

Dolafon, yeah, Dolafon. We didn't, that was the thing. We didn't know. They were private people, they kept themselves to themselves in our minds, and so we didn't know. We knew very little. We knew that they were buying a lot of land. That was something that, you know, because obviously we, we've got family in the building trade, we've got family, you know, who are connected. There's other people, friends who are connected to him.

And a lot of people sort of said, "I didn't realize that there were so many people against them." Actually, I didn't realize there is a lot of people that [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1457s) like them for what they seem to be doing now, because they seem to sort of, I don't know, they had their own little network and now they're sort of crawling out a bit now amongst the people that obviously, as I said, planning, they've got planning eating out of their hands, there's no doubt about that. We can see that. We can see that at the meeting.

I think the police, they're involved with as well, because the police aren't, I mean, oh my goodness, could you just imagine me going over to the graveyard across the road where I live and start digging up over the graves and, "Oh, I want to lay a road." You'd just get arrested on the spot, wouldn't you? You couldn't even move a grave headstone, never mind anything else. I'm frustrated with that one, yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1496s)

But the point I was trying to make, and you're absolutely right, Jackie, this is not about religious persecution of the Brethren, because you knew very little about them and had no objection to them living in your community. And they didn't cause any trouble, even if you thought their ways might be a little bit different. So this is not about religious persecution. This is actually about them having no respect for the deceased that were buried in that graveyard. It's a humanitarian thing, isn't it?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1524s)

Yeah, no, that's what I said to him. That's exactly what I said to Peter Roberts on the day. I said, "You know, you don't care, do you? You're not, you do not care." I told him, I said, "We've left you alone. We let you do what you want. Your children go to our schools." I said, "We have literally given you no problems." I said, "But now you've trespassed on our land now." And that's how I looked at it. You know, they've trespassed on us and I says, "You've dug over our ancestors' graves."

I mean, in that graveyard, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1554s) know, my husband's great-grandparents are in there. There are two young children in there. There's one, one four months old and one a year old, they're actually twins they were. And it, you know, they weren't, I don't say they weren't affected, because obviously the digging, the banging, you know, everything else that was going on in that graveyard would be affecting the whole of that, that area. I mean, you know, it's affecting the house where my mother-in-law lives, shaken. So, but he did not, Peter Roberts did not get it. He didn't. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1584s) was very like, arrogant, you know, it was just rude. It was almost like their entitlement. Yeah, it was, they do what they want.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1596s)

And I think the point was very well made, actually, in one of the discussions on Facebook. We know the Brethren have their own graveyards now, not in some places. What would happen if a contractor, non-Brethren, went and started digging over one of a Brethren grave? I mean, yeah, Abi's face says it all.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1616s)

Actually, I've got to say, that's exactly what I said to Peter Roberts. I said, "Tell you what, you tell me…" because I was really, really upset by the way. I said, "You tell me where your ancestors are buried, and I will go and take a post and I will go and hammer it into their grave." And he just looked horrified at my face, and I was very, very upset, very, very angry. And you know, the councillors that were with me were like, but to be fair to all the men that were with me, they stepped back and they allowed me to be quite confrontational back [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1646s) him. We were really, really face to face, I've got to admit, but I was angry.

But I didn't understand because a lot of them said he wouldn't be used to that. Yeah, yeah, of a woman, yes. And it was almost like, you know, they're used to speaking to the men. They don't speak to the woman. If they have to speak to the man, it's the men they don't. So he, I think he must have went home with such a headache that day, you know, never mind the issue what they've done wrong, but the fact that he must have gone [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1676s) thinking, "That woman," you know, he's looked at my husband like, "Please put her under control." And you can see my husband like, "Yeah, I have to live with that." But you know, this is what happens in the real world.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1686s)

I was just going to say, this is a hypocrisy of it all. I mean, I've got a, I'm putting up a news article here, and basically we were just talking about the Brethren having their own graveyards, and the reason for that was there was an incident in France where there were small PBCC graves that were moved to make way for construction. And basically, the Brethren got so outraged by it that is when Bruce Hales instructed the Brethren to have their own graveyards in their meeting rooms. Wow.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1723s)

I didn't know that, Ross. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1725s)

I did get told that story and I was like, well, that, it was as you said, it's hypocrisy how they've done it. You just can't, yeah.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D1736s)

I'm very surprised, knowing how careful the Brethren are with not getting themselves into trouble with the law, with planning, with anyone. They don't want any bad spotlights on them. I'm very, very surprised how they've just almost, I mean, they've completely overstepped the mark. And I know Peter Roberts, or Pete Roberts as I know him, will have an absolute nightmare on his hands because he would have been contacted by people further up the line because of the publicity, and they will have come down like a ton of bricks on that man's head. So he's, he's also got that behind him to fuel his [anger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1786s) and he won't be easy to deal with. I expect they'll get someone else like a Simpson or...

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D1791s)

No, yeah, they did. They, yeah, they did. We watched it. It was quite, it was quite funny to see, really. After we had the meeting, we went and had a meeting with Powys County Council. It was me, Alan Jones, whose grandparents are under the rubble, and Bowen, and another gentleman from the local man. So we went to have a meeting with the portfolio [holder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1816s) of the council, who was very arrogant.

Gwilyn Davies, who is the supervisor signing off officer, who seems to sign off an awful lot of stuff for the Brethren, and his relation, Gemma Bufton, who signed off this as well. Now, when we were there, they asked us what we wanted, and you know, which I thought was a bit strange because actually, we told them what we wanted, we told the Brethren what we wanted.

What happened then, they then pulled, oh, [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1850s) the morning, before I went to this meeting, the Brethren, I am right in this this, aren't I? Yeah, I think I'm right in this. They turned up, yes, they did. They turned up at my mother-in-law's house. Now, my mother-in-law, 80-year-old lady, okay, quite frail. So she was there, by luck, my husband was there as well, thank goodness. So there was a knock at the door. My husband, thank you know, my mother-in-law was going to hospital, [actually,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1880s) so he opened the door and basically, "Yeah, what you want?" And it was Peter Roberts and Ben Lynes.

Oh, yeah, yeah. So Ben Lynes was the, so you know, they came and said, they told my husband what their plans were going to be, what they were going to do, which is the plans of what they've actually done, not quite what they've done now. Anyway, just before that's it, [literally,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1910s) I was at Welshpool and I had a phone, I was on the phone to my husband and he said, "Oh my goodness, the Brethren are here. They're there now." I know that, and there was two of them. So I thought, "I'm not having this, right." And I know I think we need witnesses to a lot of stuff. We do need witnesses. I didn't trust them with my husband because, you know, and whatever.

So I literally did manage to get to Abermule quite quickly, well, probably. So I turned up, it was quite funny really. I've never met Ben Lynes, [ever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1940s) So I got my car right behind theirs, actually blocked them in. I then ran down the lane to where they were, and they were there, my husband, and they were telling him what they were going, and I went, "You all right  Brian?" And he said, "Yeah." And this Ben Lynes went, "Hello, Jackie." And you know what, right, well, it was how he said it was still ringing in my ears two days later. It was a really, it's a very strange way, it was, "Hello, Jackie." I [thought,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=1970s) "You don't know me." But I was like, I can still hear his voice, and I don't know whether it's, they're trained or there's something very, very strange there.

Anyway, so I didn't actually answer him. I certainly didn't speak to Peter Roberts. Anyway, they were telling him what the bit, and he said to me, he's trying to explain about the drain. They've a drain in now, this drain, right, which has gone into the side of this, is a drain, and it shouldn't be there. And Brian said he [knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2000s) all about drains. He said, "That's not running in the right way." And Ben said, "What you mean?" And so Brian explained where is, if it's gone back as you should do, you couldn't, you haven't only gone through those graves, the pipe has also been pushed through to the other graves. So you've disturbed more graves.

Well, this poor, poor Ben was having a breakdown, and he looked at Brian and he said to Peter, like, "Just straight to measure that now." Like, really quite at him. And this Peter's there getting his Brethren tape out, and he's like a naughty little [boy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2030s) It's quite funny really. So, and then my husband, after, you could see, and it started to rain and they sort of had nowhere to go. It was quite funny, and they were there like getting soaking wet. I had my hood on, so it's fine. And they were literally getting absolutely drenched, and it pouring down the rain. And they went, and they went by the side of my mother-in-law's. I thought, "What?" I said, "You should have invited them in." They'd have had a heart attack anyway. But he was quite, Ben was quite overpowering to Peter.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2058s)

Oh, he would be. He's a big...

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2059s)

Peter, he's, yeah, yeah, he was a very, yeah, Peter was very, yes, no, yes, no type of thing. There was, you could see the pecking order, if you like, just me not knowing them, but I could see it. Yeah. So I went to the meeting and I'd obviously already knew about the plans what they wanted to do. So they thought they were telling me something new, and after I said, "Well, actually, I already knew because I'd met Ben and I'd met Peter." They didn't want me to get involved with them, but I insisted they had my email address and they contacted me, and they were not to knock on [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2089s) mother-in-law's door ever again, because I did think it's right. They didn't like that, but that was hard luck.

So a couple days later, I had an email off Ben, very nice, very friendly, trying to be. "Yes, what is it you want to do?" This, I told him what we wanted, everything basically what we needed and what we wanted, basically restore it all back, plus we wanted hedging. Because the problem you've got is with the hedge, my mother-in-law, and that, I mean, to be fair, it might have even devalued [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2120s) mother-in-law's house because you're looking straight into a graveyard, literally. So we asked for the hedge to be put, a mature hedge, when you come back.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2128s)

So just to recap, when you started the campaign and then it obviously went back to the council, am I right in recollecting that the council also had said, is that correct, they had said, "You've got to restore this." I mean, what was decided at the council level?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2145s)

Decency, we've been having private meetings with the Brethren, you see. See, we've never always had a meeting together, okay? It's been closed doors between the Brethren and Powys County Council. Then the Brethren contacted me. Now, you know, off path, going past my mother-in-law, don't know what they were going to do with my mother-in-law, to be fair, I don't know what that was about. But anyway, obviously spoke and told us what they, and they were going to put a pathway up the side. Yeah, they weren't going to be touching any graves.

They were going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2175s) get a stonemason in to replace the graves, right, put the headstones back. And I asked for a minister to be present when the grave headstones go on. Yeah, I asked for somebody to, because obviously you do have graves with headstones, but again, when you're talking the age of those graves, there's a, there's a few graves under there. And I have been told there is one that's unmarked, at least, if the families come forward and said there is an unmarked grave there.

So we need, ideally, they [needed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2205s) and I'm sure I'm within rights saying, they needed to get the machinery to sort of trace where the graves are. You can't just go and take a load of headstones and suddenly go, "Oh, sorry, oh, we'll pop one over there and we'll pop one over there." That's what it looks like they've done. Can you see the state, if you actually look at that last, those last photographs. This is the original, yeah, if you see this, they've put, oh, you know, like stumps, and their pegs in there, as my husband calls them. So yeah, that's it, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2236s) a peg there and there's another two along. They're almost blending in with the ground.

Oh, yeah, I can just see them. That's not where those graves are. These graves are more over this side. They're more over to the, you know, rear, if you like, of the chapel. So is there actually more graves under there? Is that what the pegs are by? Look, can you see? They've probably, this is the original, is it, before it was touched?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2258s)

Yeah, that's it. And there's another grave further up as well, you can't quite see it. This is like, oh, in the far end corner, yeah, towards the gates where the gate would be, the other side, Kerry, yeah, sort of there. As you come through the gates, the gates that they've just put up there, there is actually a grave there. There's a stone, that's it, yeah. So there's one there, and then there's like, but they haven't put them in the right places. So they're just gonna now just basically drop the headstones where they want, yeah. And they need [underground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2289s) scanners, don't they?

That's right, yeah. I told him they want that. I said we wanted a minister there when they get the headstones on, and we want the hedge put back in. And there was another thing, I can't remember talking, but anyway, he actually got back to me after I told him and he said he's passed it on to the team, this is Ben Lynes said, he's passed it on to the team, whoever they are, "And I can't guarantee you will get everything you want, but we are working the best we can towards what you're requesting."

Right, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2319s) then turned to me and said, "Please do not put these emails on social media." He didn't say I couldn't read them out though, he just told me not to go. We haven't put them on social media.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2326s)

He's trying to control you already.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2328s)

Thank you, I know, yes. That's what's really, really, really, really got up my nose. So now, this is why I didn't know what they were going to do with the final, what they've done now, what we've seen, you know, this what they've done, whatever you, I wouldn't even call it whatever that [is,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2349s) I didn't know what they were going to do. It's still incorrect. It shouldn't be like that. That's completely wrong again. So you can see the hedge at the side, that is not their hedge, you see. So that's why, but that is including the plans, but that's not their hedge. And that's where the original footpath was supposed to be going.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2366s)

I know what will happen next. I can almost envision what will happen next. That double garage, they will ask whoever that belongs to if they can purchase that double garage, and they will offer ridiculous money so that they can make a [road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2379s) in that way instead. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2381s)

What access do they have now?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2383s)

Right, do you know the other side of that chapel, at the other side, there is an access road. They can go out that way onto the road. So behind the chapel, but we can't, yeah, literally the opposite side of that chapel now, the other side, there is actually a road through there. You can go through there.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2401s)

So they could have built a road in from that way and come at the chapel from the other way.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2403s)

If you actually look at the, oh, where's the chapel? You can't see it on that one. Have you got the plans with the red? Yeah, the plans with the red. Just off screen. Yeah, there's the other, yeah, the other plans. The original plans you've got, have a look at those. I don't know if it's on that one or not. No, it's not on that one, no.

Right, where's the day, can you see the other side? Yeah, yeah, I'm not bringing you onto the road, but apparently, this is really funny now, we have a B and…so it's really, like a lane, right? This is a B road that goes across, right? So that would come out onto a B road. These, the highways had refused that because they said visibility. They've got a lot more visibility there than they would [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2452s) on that new road because you come out there, you'd be blocking it. It's absolutely horrendous there, there's a bend. So they, you know, they, it's just crazy. It's crazy the whole lot.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2460s)

It shows how desperate they were for somewhere to have a supper, though.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2463s)

Absolutely crazy. Yeah, I don't get it. So now, as far as I know is, I think they will come through there now. I think they're to get planning, we're not even planning, it's just be signed off, because that seems to be what's looking like happening at the minute. Things are being signed off. I mean, for them to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2482s) that work what they've done now, they've altered their plans, but it hasn't gone to a committee. So how has that been, how are they able to just go and go, "Oh, actually, we changed our mind now, we're not going to do it like that one, we're going to do it like this one." We're going to have the exit, the entrance to the other area.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2498s)

So what do you think, I mean, what I'm trying to get to here is, you know, you're not Brethren, you, we all have been Brethren, we kind of know some of the mentality. What did it make you think about the mentality of a group of people that could do that without thinking it? I mean, cover, dig up and [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2526s) graves and concrete over them without thinking it might upset people? What, what, how, what does that say to you about the Brethren and their mindset?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2533s)

I think they're disrespectful. They are disrespectful to us now. I think they've actually have upset, I think we've opened our eyes to them, whereas I said before, we let them get on with whatever they wanted to do. My goodness, this now has blown out, open so much that a lot, I mean, you see our page, you've seen what people are writing. Even yesterday, people are disrespecting them now.

I had heard that Peter Roberts had said to someone, "Oh, I think we've upset the people in the village." Yeah, you have, mate, you have. You're right there. You know, I don't think, and somebody said, "Well, yeah, I think might have done." Yeah, you have, spot on. Yeah, I mean, you have upset the people.

The thing is, what I don't think they realized was where my husband's from, you've got the old and you've got the newer people coming in, but the older people, the community is still there. So when I [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2599s) to a thing called the Silver Threads in the village hall and I did a speech to the 60 women and men, maybe, that were there, and I explained what was happening at Hodley Chapel, bear in mind this is in the village of Kerry. And I turned around and I said, they didn't know who owned it at the time, and I went and explained, I got my photos, I did like a PowerPoint for them. And these are, these are ones that, you know, over 60, you know, when they do all these bingo and whatever they do.

And their faces, when I said it was the Plymouth Brethren, that's actually, you know, I said it was a Dolafon Trust, and I said, and they all like, didn't have a clue. I went, "The Plymouth Brethren, the Brethren." And I heard the gasp in that room. And they went, literally, the horror and shock, and they wouldn't give us that petition, and they all started signing it and signing it. Well, it must have been about 50, 60 people in that one room. And Kerry isn't huge, it's not a huge village, as Abi would know. Yeah, but that's a lot of people from Sarn, from Abermule. So when you think about it now, they are getting a very bad reputation in the area. They really, really are.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2673s)

And I've noticed they've ramped up [RRT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2676s) work to try to cover up what's going on at that chapel. I've seen like two or three town events. Yeah, it's like, it's not going to work. Like, people know why that charity was set up in the first place, to disguise what the hell they're doing. And now they're trying to use it again.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2695s)

Yeah, the issue they've got now is because of this mistake they have made, and it is a clear, huge, huge impact mistake, error on their part. They [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2711s) now highlighted other things about them that we, I mean, me just sitting here talking to you for now, I mean, I didn't know you people. I didn't even know there were ex-Brethren people out there. I had no idea. But the information that I have learned and the stories that I've been told, I mean, obviously that's related to other people I know.

And you as many, I don't know if you do know, but I'm actually a town councillor in [Newtown.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2741s) I couldn't get involved as a town councillor for Kerry because I'm not linked to it, but obviously if you put my name in, you'll see who I am. The thing is, I also know a lot, a lot of people. And at the end of the day, if people know me and they know if I'm telling them, I'm telling them. And I generally am. I mean, as I said, I, you know, I can be quite controversial in a lot of things, but this, they messed with the wrong people, if I'm honest. They came to the small little hamlet of Hodley and thought…he said, "Oh nobody’s  been in here for seven years." Yeah, I said, "But they have.”  “Oh, but they haven't cut the grass." No, they haven't. It was a little of a nature area, but people still went walking around there. People did go in there. You know, the one woman from Oswestry turned up to put flowers on her grandparents' grave, what she does twice a year with her 12-year-old daughter. And hey presto, you've, there, there, she's got nothing. The grave, it's gone. Yeah. So I've heard from an insider, they didn't, they didn't know where to put those flowers.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2808s)

Oh, that is just heart-rending.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2810s)

That's where the grave was. That was it.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2813s)

So poignant, that picture.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2816s)

You think of it this way. She's been going there twice a year for probably since her parents, grandparents died, right? She's been going there and she couldn't even find where to put the flowers. So how on earth are those people going to know where to put the headstones back? She's been going, she should know the position of where her grandparents were buried, but she couldn't do that. So she can't, they ain't gonna know at all. And that in itself is disrespectful, that they think by putting some pegs in some [soil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2847s) that sorted it. No, it hasn't. It hasn't. No. And it's more disrespectful, it's arrogant. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2852s)

So I've heard from an insider that the opinion of people that are rightly kicking up a fuss about what they've done, that, let me look at the words, hang on, one of them was sentimental. Now, Brethren don't agree with sentimentality. So no one ever puts flowers on any of their graves. Once they're dead, they're with the Lord and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2890s) just their body left in the ground. And so why would you go and visit a graveyard? Like people don't visit their graves, unless it's like moms with young children who have lost a dad or something like that. Once you're in the ground, you're forgotten about. That's how they deal with it. So they said, so the insider who's given me the information has said that the villagers are being ridiculous and sentimental and pathetic.

So that's their mentality about you fighting actually for what's right. I mean, it's your, it's your loved ones. Just because they don't get sentimental or have feelings like we have feelings out here, they don't have feelings. Just because we are different in that we have feelings, doesn't mean that they can destroy what's not theirs.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D2947s)

I agree with you. And that is, and I can see that. I could see that by the attitude of Peter Roberts. You could see it, the way he spoke. It was like, as I said, he was almost like a blank canvas. He was like, he was in a different zone. His own attitude was, "What's your problem? There's no graves under here." Well, yes, there is.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=2972s)

So Jackie, I also had a message forwarded to me in September and I want to read it out because I would quite like you to comment on it. This was a message that was going around the Brethren in September. 

"I gather it's all blown out of proportion by someone who likes making trouble. From a very overgrown graveyard which you couldn't get at, to a maintained one, and this is the [price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3003s) you pay. The council knew the complainer and wanted to let it blow over. The graveyard won't be owned by the Brethren once the work is completed, but we will maintain it. I've gathered someone who has left us from possibly the Gloucester area got involved somewhere in it."

Would that be me? I have no idea who that person is, the person from Gloucester. So that again demonstrates the level of real concern, or lack of it, that this community have for what has happened in your area. How does that make you feel?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3044s)

It doesn't surprise me that they've said that and it doesn't surprise me. I could probably pinpoint where the source came from as well, who's told them this. Because obviously, as much as they are against people like me who speak out within the community, and there is a couple of us that do this because we're for the people on various topics, the issue with these lot, the, you know, the issue with who they're involved with, they're all, a lot of them are very sneaky.

[They're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3077s) out for themselves, and that's the problem. They're very selfish people who the Brethren are linked with as well. Yeah, we all know, you know, your Powys County Council, the planning officers, as I said, the AM, the MP, they all backed off. They never have pictures there, they didn't come and try any, they didn't do what they should have done. The county of those, county cancer, they never at all did anything, and that in itself to me speaks volumes.

So they can say, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3108s) mean, as I said, when they say, "someone who likes causing trouble," "someone who likes making trouble," no, it's not, no, it's this, you know, is this trouble?

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3119s)

Yeah, respect. And what would happen if somebody did that to one of their graveyards? Exactly.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3124s)

Would they make sure? I said, yeah, that is what I said to Jake Berryman, who's the portfolio holder for the county council, and he smirked in the meeting at me, and I was furious. I said, "You find this funny? You find what they have done funny?" And he didn't, "No, I don't." I said, "Well, you're laughing." You know, and that was it. It was, I don't know, I don't know where these people are from. I don't know what's going on with people. All I just know is it, it's, it's well corrupt, really, isn't it? It's [completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3161s) corrupt.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3163s)

So what I am seeing through all of this, through what I've read and for the involvement with obviously the ex-Brethren and listening to your stories, it's horrific what I'm hearing. It's horrific what I've read, and it's all about, and you are 100%, it's greed, corruption, control, yes. And that is somebody who's not a Brethren, who's had nothing to do with any of you before until what, the end of July, and when I first had contact with somebody.

**Jackie Davies**

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3195s) that is it. And that's what I've seen. That's all I've seen now. And they're, you know, they've mentally abused the women, and they do, but what I'm reading, you know, they really, there was a word this morning somebody, I think on what something I read, and I can't think what the words you use now, when they're just controlled, they just, they can't think for themselves. It's, I didn't realize how bad it was. And that is the truth. You know, you, they're not saving you. [They're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3225s) not, I just don't get it. I just don't, honestly. And this now, and they don't like the control, they don't like it that somebody's stood up against them. I can see that, you know.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3235s)

Makes you wonder, because I know of another case going back about five or six years where the local people tried to campaign, again, it was against some trees that were cut down that shouldn't have been cut down, a bit like the hedge, Jackie, and nothing came of it. What it makes you wonder is how much this has happened with other planning permissions that have come in, in as much as plans go in and then what actually happens [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3266s) deviate from the plans, and unless there is an objection, it goes under, it flies under the radar.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3272s)

Well, the issue with this was there was objections. There was 23 objections.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3279s)

And your petition as well had a few signatures.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3281s)

Yeah, well, yeah, that's right. Well, before this, in a year ago, there was 23 petitioners because that was, there's only 27 residents there anyway in the hamlet. So the 23 signed the petition and that got ignored. Why could that get ignored? They gave genuine reasons, they get proof, there was letters, and they ignored it. And they still signed it off, this relative, this couple who were relatives signed it off, who worked for the council.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3307s)

When did the Brethren actually buy the chapel and the plot of land, how long ago?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3312s)

I think, oh, I can't say, I think it was about 2019\. Okay, it could have been '17. Wasn't that long. I know that the plans went in on 2021, right? But the land was owned by someone else and it was some sisters. It's, you know, but it's supposed to have been a resident. This is another thing, see, we're not, none of the ways we're on this and we're asking questions on this. We got told it was going to be for [residents,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3342s) so basically residential. So it's going to be a two-bedroom place.

But we're not sure whether that went through or not, because when we asked Gemma Bufton at the meeting, "Is it, will they have to go back to planning to ask for the change of use for it to be a meeting hall?" We got told by Gemma Bufton, "Oh yeah, but it's always, it was a chapel before, so yes, it stays the same. It's always been, there's been no change of use." Now, we were told there was change of use. We were told it was actually [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3373s) residential, two-bedroom residential place.

So I'm a bit confused by that one, and we still haven't had answers from Powys County Council, obviously, because they haven't put the plans on site. So we haven't seen it. We've only got those ones that you've got now. We've all got, prior to that, funny enough, they're not there.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3389s)

Aren't plans, again, this is a bit my ignorance about planning, which you would know, Jackie, but aren't any plans supposed to be public property? Yeah, go on to a council's website, and if your neighbour was planning to build an extension that needed planning permission, you could just go on and view.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3409s)

And they're there, yeah. Oddly enough, they're not, not on this case anyway, which is a bit strange, I think. Yeah, and we've asked and we're still not being given the answers. So yeah, yeah. So the only plans we've got are the ones that you, you know, what we have access to right now. But I mean, this has been going on, I think, since 2002\. It got objected, I mean, it had been objected, objected, objected, and then all of a sudden, signed off. There we are, thank you very much. Bit [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3440s) cash on the backhand there. "Oh well, you know, oh, we had COVID." I'm sorry, love, you weren't locked in last year, which was 2022\. You weren't locked in. You could have come down and had a look and you would have seen what they wanted to do was to go over graves, but she, you know, wouldn't do it.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3456s)

So what I've been told by an insider is that the modus operandi with these rooms is you find a suitable building or land, buy the building without planning permission, and miraculously, the planning permission will come. So whatever is happening, and we have no proof that anything untoward has happened, so I will stress anything we say is speculative, people can draw their own conclusions, something must be going on. Because most people wouldn't buy a building without being pretty sure they could get change of use and planning permission for what they wanted. Otherwise, what are they going to do with the building? Is that a fair comment?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3504s)

Yeah, so I say that's fair enough, because you wouldn't go buy it, would you? I wouldn't go and buy it, no. Nobody with any common sense would go and buy a building that hasn't got, it's got no water, it has no toilet, it had nothing in there. So unless you knew it was going to be able to be put into what you wanted to, you wouldn't go and buy it. What I was concerned about it, which I think you might have seen in the write-up, it says that the pulpit has to stay within there. It was supposed to stay [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3534s) that chapel.

Now, I'm hearing that the Brethren would not allow such a thing to happen. No, you know, I've been told that would not happen. So then somebody said, "Oh, I got told that, oh, they'll put it into a wooden chamber up in the roof." Well, there's no roof, there is a roof, but there's no, there's no second floor in there. It's literally just, there's no second. So unless they're going to plan on, but then I got told they wouldn't use the meeting room if the pulpit was in there.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3562s)

No, no, they wouldn't, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3564s) it, no, yeah, I know exactly, because we're obviously the evil lot. So yeah, that's right, or whatever you want to call us. I don't know what they, there is loads of names, I'm sure.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3575s)

But I just think, and when I question that as well, and I asked, I asked for the book. Now, when you, as I said, you have a book or you have a register, and I asked Peter Roberts for that as well. I said, "The deaths and all that," I said, "where's the book?" "Oh, we didn't have it." Well, surely a church or chapel would have certain [items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3594s) that stay with it, with that…1840.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3598s)

But they're clueless. They've got no idea about this kind of thing. No, they are absolutely out of their league on this. I mean, their churches are basically warehouses with carpet. There are no windows, just an entrance door, maybe a fire exit for regulations, and toilets, and like an area where they prepare the Lord's suppers, like the loaf and the cup and all that. Other than that, it's literally a glorified, insulated warehouse. It, there's, it's not a place of worship in the terms of what we think about here is a place what we don't understand.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3642s)

Things like a pulpit, and I don't even know what a rood rail is. That's how naive even I am, and I've been out here just over a year. So I know what a pulpit is, but I don't know what that rail thing is. But they definitely wouldn't keep that in there because it's not what they do.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3657s)

It's, I mean, where even is that? Have they literally...

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3660s)

Well, that's my concern. I've asked that, and because obviously you can't access it, they won't let you in. I have asked a couple of the [workmen,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3672s) but obviously they're sort of like, the ones that were there, they're sort of staying a bit quiet now because they know there's so much controversy over it. They're a bit...

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3680s)

Are they Brethren workmen or are they not?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3682s)

They are actually the local men, local contractors. I know some of them.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3687s)

Okay, so most like the ripping out the hedge, that will have been done by PBCC Brethren on a Saturday. I could probably name a bunch of them, and they'll have just ripped it out and taken it away in the [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3704s) of a trailer or something owned by someone very quickly.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3707s)

You are right, it did go extremely quickly. Well, yeah, literally, it was gone in a day, and you can imagine, it's a huge hedge. I mean, it could have been 70 feet long, it was about 50, probably was about 70 feet actually. We know there was birds in there, there was 100%. You go, you go take a hedge down during nesting season and see if you didn't get fined. Do you know [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3734s) I mean? It's just absolutely...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3735s)

They did that in a village in Surrey, actually, on a Saturday. All the trees were chopped down, and I think that's exactly what you said, Abi, they did it themselves, and that's where the neighbours got quite irate about that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3750s)

There's a regulation that, I mean, farmers aren't even allowed to cut their hedges. Yeah, I think it's September or something like that.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3757s)

Oh yeah, it's September. And what happened was, he said, Peter said, "Oh, well," and he named the person who cut the hedge. I happen to know the person who cut the hedge very, very well. That person cut the hedge, and I know that because I know his invoicing, he cut that hedge on the last day and before nesting season, right? We know he did, we know what happened, right? He had no idea that that hedge was being taken out. He just got told to cut it, which what he does every year, blah, blah, blah.

If they were going to [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3787s) that hedge out, what they're supposed to have done is put netting over it. Now, I'm sure, I don't know if you go around Great Britain, you will see in certain places when they're taking hedges and they put special netting, don't they, whether it be orange or whatever. Why did they not put that netting over? Was a question I asked both Ben and because they don't care. Well, they didn't. In fact, they looked at me like going, like what not. And you can see the face, "What are you talking about?"

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3813s)

As Abi said, they wouldn't have the sort of worldly knowledge.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3819s)

For animals, anyway.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3823s)

No, yeah, well, I didn't even, I, that's something else I found out, that they actually don't have pets, which is even more like, oh my goodness.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3831s)

But yeah, they have no respect in any way for, they will torture animals.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3836s)

Yeah, wow. That's another story for another day, I think, because I read that one as well. But yes, yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3846s)

In amongst all of this, so you've got this group that came along and dug up over graves and put tarmac down over it, and seemingly against what the plan said, total disrespect. They're then being quite rude about the residents who have rightly raised objections. Has the word "sorry" ever been mentioned?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3874s)

No. No. And that's something I have listened out for, and no, they haven't apologized. They don't, I can imagine they don't apologize, and they certainly haven't apologized so much. Actually, just thinking about, oh, I haven't got my thing on. I think I'm over it. Oh, "Sorry for the delay in getting back to you." That was it. That was just, that was sorry.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3895s)

Not sorry for actually concreting over people's ancestors' graves.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3900s)

Yeah, I remember though, yeah, it was just sorry for the not getting back to me. That was it. That was that Ben Lynes. Yeah, yeah. I don't think they know the meaning of the word "apologize."

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3908s)

No, I imagine they do.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3910s)

I remember somebody, an ex-member, telling me that in one of their visits from the priests, the priest said quite categorically, and I think this phrase sums them up, "Even when the Brethren are wrong, they're right."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3924s)

Right, yeah, that was said so often.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3926s)

Yeah. So that, that is, that is a quote, is, I mean, I've only ever heard this hearsay, but you've heard it said actually.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D3933s)

You said in the church meetings even sometimes. Yeah, and if you don't believe it, don't oppose it. Yeah, if you don't believe in it, don't oppose it. So, bollocks.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=3948s)

So what I'm trying to get at here with the situation that you're faced with, Jackie, most people will say what they did was atrocious and disrespectful and inhumane. Whatever your religious faith, religion has nothing to do with this. This is on humanitarian grounds. When somebody does something that the majority of the population thinks is inhumane, the first thing you would expect is, "I am sorry that we did this."

But when you've got an attitude that's inbred that says, "Even when we're wrong, we're right," you kind of see what you're up against psychologically, don't you? Which is probably what you have found when you've tried to talk to the Brethren. Have they turned around to you and approached it differently, saying, "I am so sorry, we [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4002s) so sorry we didn't realize the graves were there. Please can we apologize to the residents? Please can we have photographs of how it looked and at any cost, we will restore it to how it was?" Would you feel very differently about it?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4018s)

Yes, because I tell you why, the attitude of Peter Roberts was what got everybody's back up, I think. Just, just that pure, you got out the car, told us to move on, and it was like, yeah, if we'd have had an apology, if... I'm sorry, I've got a dog.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4038s)

That's okay, you're normal. We've had podcast dogs, it's fine.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4042s)

If they've [apologized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4048s) and said that, you know, it's a misunderstood, I couldn't really say it's a misunderstanding what they do, but if there's something, yes, if you've had more empathy, they lacked empathy. They didn't consider other people's feelings. And we would have, if it had been, if you have been more, yeah, it was unapproachable. It was totally unapproachable. Their, their attitude was really, it was wrong. It was how they dealt with it. Yeah. If they'd have been more friends, I mean, what I don't like is where I keep seeing where they say, "Oh, they, they, they want to work with your neighbours or whatever." What's the quote they keep using? I can't remember.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4087s)

And we live along, quotes about, "We live alongside the community and we work with our neighbours," and all this.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4094s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's what I'm thinking is, is the issue. They, they say all this, but they don't. Yeah, are they?

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4103s)

That's an outsider's perspective. Imagine what we feel like.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4106s)

I know, I know. I, I honestly, I don't know. It is shocking. It's shocking. I said what I've heard, what their attitude should have been better towards us, and it wasn't. It was totally disrespectful. They didn't care.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4121s)

Do you actually want what is basically a cult in your village anyway?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4125s)

You what, sorry?

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4126s)

Do you want what is basically a cult in your village anyway?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4129s)

No, right, no, obviously we don't, because I do not, the thing is, I do not believe in their way of, I let them do it because I thought the women was happy to be controlled. I am not going to be controlled. I've never been controlled, and I've seen people, friends, you know, even in the last, in our world, if you like, where women have actually been controlled. It does happen, we do see it.

But we are, where we are, we're told, you know, we know there's help there to help us, and it's not right. You know, you've got a prison for mental control now, you couldn't do before. Do you know what I mean? You could go to prison for it now, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4175s) you know, used to be physical, but now bought the mental side of it. And I'm all agreement, because that is really, that's gonna have a huge effect on you mentally, you know, definitely. You know, the manipulation, the control.

And I just see the problem I've got now is I see them as that when I look at them now. When I've seen them, bumped into these women today, and I looked and they looked at me, oh, they were quite, yes, I must admit, quite hard-faced looking at me, I must admit that they [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4205s) do eye contact. And I just looked back, actually, I had some pity for them because I thought, "Oh my goodness, you were in a different world to us. You are so controlled." And wouldn't it be nice if they all just turned around and, I don't know, turned on the, turned on them. And it's all wrong. It's all wrong. But, and I said, and we know through what I've learned, it's money, corruption, and greed, and control.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4235s)

And I have another question, and I think it's one of my last ones, but when they've done the restoration work, has it been actually investigated as to whether the graves have been disturbed on a, on a deeper level?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4250s)

The issue we've got, and I'll be honest with you, I've spoken to somebody yesterday, we've been told that the police ombudsman isn't taking it any further, because it went to the ombudsman. The police aren't going to do a prosecution. And as for the Home Office, well, the issue I've got there is because I got seen, and it was in writing there, I only seen, I think in the paper, that the MP had sent it over to the Home Office, but we've got no proof of that. The MP is a Conservative, and a lot of the donations and the [charity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4296s) money goes to the Brethren, and it gives in full circle, doesn't it?

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4300s)

So, the Newtown Brethren bring in a lot of money with their businesses and their houses, and it upgrades the Newtown area, and the MPs will see that and be like, "Wow, this is really benefiting our town. They're all churchy, aren't they?" Because you've also got the Hope Church, which is the Pentecostal, the evangelist church, which is, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4326s) don't know what they're doing, but they're all linked as well, because they have Rapid Relief Team going to those. So when they have a function, the Rapid Relief Team goes. So do you know that they're, they're connected on the outside, but they're definitely not on the inside?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4338s)

Yes, the Brethren don't do that. Yeah, I do know what you mean there, but then our AM is very, very connected with the Hope Church, you know. So the issue you are, when you really start, it's like having a family tree and the branches all coming [off,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4356s) but they're all, if you actually look, there's, there's a connection, and the connection is obviously the charitable side of what they're doing.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4366s)

You know, it's where the money's... Not charitable, though.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4369s)

No, I know, no, I know, but it's, I know it's not, the apparent charity, yeah. It's like, yeah, it's where they get the money from, isn't it, I should say, which is under the umbrella of charity.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4380s)

Yes. Is there any, anyone privately that could, could we set up a fundraiser or anything [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4387s) who actually investigates disturbance of graves?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4394s)

I suppose it's, well, it is the Home Office, isn't it? There's a burials and something, I can't remember what it was now, crematorium or something, it's those ones, isn't it? It's them. And it's where the, the thing is, we were seeing how far they're gonna, I mean, personally, I think that's it. What we've got, those pictures there, I don't think they're going to do anything else. I think they're going to stick the headstones on and that's the end of it.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4416s)

That was going to be one of my questions, actually, as I'm just bringing up the picture again. You know, this is what you saw the other day. Do they think that is it? Do they think that that is that they're going to put that, and I mean, have they actually communicated with you what they've done there and why?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4435s)

No, they've not communicated with me. That is pictures taken obviously from people up there, and I've got that. No, I had him telling me, and Ben Lynes sent him an email saying, "Oh, they're, oh," he said, "the workmen are going to go up on Saturday to have a look and sort something out." And he said he didn't want any of the workmen being disturbed by anybody, you know, dictating. I'm lucky for him, I wasn't here. I was actually over in England, so I [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4465s) in Wales at all. So he was very lucky that weekend I wasn't here.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4469s)

But obviously I thought you listened to him.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4473s)

Do you know whether the workmen that actually put this back were the original contractors who were non-Brethren, or was it Brethren that went in and put the soil back?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4484s)

I got told it was the original contractor did go in. However, Peter Roberts was there too, okay, which shocked the fact that he was actually there as well, but he was there too.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4495s)

So it was, this will be his little project because it's in his area, so it's his baby. Yeah, if anything goes wrong, it's on his head and people will be literally ripping his head off and shitting down his neck. So it's his publicity.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4515s)

Yeah, yeah. And even to the point where if it's not solved, he could find himself in trouble with the Brethren, couldn't he? Ultimately, you know, if the publicity is that bad.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4525s)

That's what I think is hilarious, because I know him. Yeah. And well, we've asked for a memorial service as well, because we deserve it.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4533s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4535s)

We've asked for a memorial service once the headstones have been put back in the right places. But that would be a miracle if that happens. I don't think it will.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4544s)

I don't think they'll organize it.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4546s)

No, no. I said that we would, but yeah, I do not think they will allow it because bear in mind, they still own this. We don't own this. They still own it.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4559s)

We have, I think, right of way to go into that, but they must have no rights over that graveyard because...

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4565s)

Well, they bought the graveyard and they bought the chapel. Okay. But that's got other people's relatives in. So I know if I went and bought a church with, with like [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4586s) church that had got planning permission to be turned into a house, because it happens, I would have to be prepared for people to come into my, I don't know, garden or whatever.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4595s)

Yeah, I think they have to give access rights, I think, but I wouldn't be 100% on it.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4599s)

Because I got told as well, in a church, yes, but it's a chapel, and there is different rules between a church and a chapel graveyards. I got told there is a different rule.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4616s)

No, I was just going to say, you can bet your bottom dollar a few years down the line that the access will be fully locked and you won't even be able to get in there.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4623s)

Yeah, and that's why I think they've kept the gates, because we asked for those gates to be removed. We said we want the gates and we want a hedge put back up. They said they, they were going to keep the, you know, the outside the same. Tarmac, isn't there a little bit of tarmac for two car spaces? And they were ever so kind, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4647s) they said that we could keep, they were going to leave the tarmac what is where we're standing, yeah, that there, they're going to leave the tarmac area for us.

### **Abi**

That's very good of them.

### **Jackie Davies**

Yes, but we're not stupid people. They aren't leaving that tarmac for us. They're waiting for it to calm down to then suddenly open it all up again.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4667s)

Yeah, yeah. And if I can just reiterate the message that fell into my hands, one sentence, so this is a message that was circulating around the Brethren community between Brethren meetings, "The graveyard won't be owned by the Brethren once the work is completed, but we will maintain it." That's what they're telling their own people.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4690s)

Yeah, I'm not sure about that, to be quite honest with you. I don't know.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4694s)

Would you be happy with that, Jackie, or not? I mean, who would own it, the council, or...?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D4698s)

They own it. They own it because they bought it.

### **Abi**

I mean, this is just my cynical mind, but do you think they're telling the rest of the Brethren that just to stop any questions being asked?

### **Jackie Davies**

Yes, I do.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4714s)

I think that message is very much to calm down any questions that might be raised inside. You know, this is it, these are, it is to belittle the concerns of the residents where you live, Jackie, yeah, in their eyes, so that questions don't get asked. And it's the sort of tactic they play whenever, frankly, they know they've done something wrong.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4735s)

Yeah, because he, if I remember what Ben Lynes said to myself, my husband, on the very rainy day, he said, "We will maintain it for a short while," but he didn't say what happens after that. So they'll do as much as they, I mean...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4755s)

As much as they have to do to pass muster to get you off their backs. Yeah, that's the authorities.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4763s)

I mean, the thing is, if it, we still don't, until we know whether that chapel is a residential one or whether it's a meeting hall one, because we still don't know, we do not know, right? Then if they were going to do change of use, then obviously the people are going to go against it. I can tell you now, there's gonna be objections straight away, whatever they want to do right now, because of what they've done to us, there is going to be objections.

It's happening. If they want houses built on the little bit of land around the side, which is possibly what they may be looking at, or they may have bought the land, who knows, which is probably what they are doing or their plan was, there's going to be objections. There's going to be, they are not, and I think now what this has actually done, [brought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4809s) against them, is whenever there's any planning going around in this area now and it is to do with the Brethren or the Gospel Trust, there's going to be objections, and there's going to be a lot of them now.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4821s)

Yeah, and I'd like to extend that probably beyond Wales, because I know of two areas, one just outside Cambridge and one just out, outside Buntingford, and this is being told to me by non-Brethren, that have been bought by the Brethren. One, I believe, is a village hall, I think that's right, and one is a pub. So what I want to say to the residents that live in that area is, these properties have already been bought. So I can see a pattern here, and it's not that you're accusing anybody of wrongdoing, because we have no proof at this point, but there's a pattern here, isn't there? These are properties that have been bought by the Brethren and at present have no planning permission for anything.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4876s)

Actually, Stafford bought a pub and they converted the back room of the pub into a meeting room and they've done nothing with the front.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4876s)

I mean, if they buy these properties and they put in planning permission and it goes through the due process, residents are consulted, it's passed through the right committees that have no conflict of interest, and they get their planning commission and they stick to the plans, I don't think anybody would have any objection to that, would they?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4909s)

Well, unless they knew who they were, unless they knew that paedophiles were going to be meeting in a church down the road, then I expect they might have some objections.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://youtu.be/qL4YlelBASU?t=4919)

Well, they may do, but I mean, if the due process is being followed, because as you say, Jackie, and I agree, Abi, most people don't really know what goes on or who the Brethren are, as Jackie herself certainly said she didn't. But if you take it on the face of it, there's nothing wrong with that. But what seems to be happening is properties seem to be being bought, somehow planning goes through, no questions asked, which we don't know why.

### [**Abi**](https://youtu.be/qL4YlelBASU?t=4949)

Money. Well, yeah. It's money and the right contacts. 

**Ross Turner**

I'm not sure if I've got this correct, but Kingsley, and they bought their plot of land for their new city room, and they had no end of trouble with the planning, and in the end, they were basically told to do anything by any means possible to get the planning through. Because they had no end of trouble, and they got it passed in the end. I mean, it's there to this day.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4978s)

Jackie, if you think that something has gone on with the way the plans for the Hodley Chapel were passed, do you think that will ever come out? I mean, I know people will go to lengths to hide it.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=4992s)

Yeah, it will if it comes into my domain, that's for sure.

### **Abi**

Yes, girl, love it. 

**Jackie Davies**

Yeah, what did I have the other day? I had a, oh, my cheeks swelled up a bit the other day and one of the girls actually said, "Oh, I bet they've got a voodoo doll." It's getting to be a bit like, you know, it's almost like a bit funny.

No, what happened, what has happened and what does happen is planning was under investigation. I don't know if you're aware of it, and the report got put through Audit Wales about Powys planning in May, and it was not for good reading, let's put it that way. It was pretty horrific, and they were not happy with how Powys planning were actually doing things, or maybe not doing things in the correct way.

[So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5047s) I am aware that this, a very, very good report has actually gone regarding this, because I know the person who sent it and I've read it and I've seen it, and it's gone off to Audit Wales, bringing up obviously the Brethren or Dolafon Trust, yeah. And they say in that, obviously they've got properties that they seem to be having, allowing to be built with no local needs on them, and you know, other things that are happening. So [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5078s) has gone to Audit Wales.

### **Abi**

Which, you know, is, do you want the Brethren to know this? Because they will watch this podcast.

### **Jackie Davies**

Doesn't matter, does it? It's gone. What I mean, yeah, I know, it's gone. It's gone. And to be fair, if there's any corruption, they'll, they'll get, they'll stop it anyway, won't they?

### **Abi**

Yeah, yes, if you look at the point of view.

### **Jackie Davies**

We know it's gone. I'm happy it's gone because it needed to go. I wasn't the one who sent it, but I read it and I just think it needs it. You [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5108s) they may stop it. They're going to have people in the higher up. This is the problem. This is the issue. I feel sorry for yourself. I'm not really bothered about me because, you know, the only impact I've had is having to deal with the people who are very distressed about the graveyard and what's happening down there. But you lived in it. You, you've been a part of this cult. You know exactly. And I think many people are starting to think that. Trust me, no, I generally feel sorry for all of you, and I think you're [survivors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5138s)

You're strong. You, you know, I've been battling with them the last couple of months and I just see the arrogance and the greed and just the whole disrespect they've got for people like me, you know, as worldly people. But you, you people are amazing. Honestly, I really, really do think you're strong-willed, amazing. And you know what? It's their loss that you've left them, isn't it? Really, it is. You will, you, you will. Yeah, I mean, honestly, I'm in awe of what you've done, all of you. You were really brave and clever people, and I, you know, what a great community you are. You know, you are really. Yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad I had the contact from a relevant person and even if I was a bit suspicious at the time, but you know what, I was, the best thing ever did, answering the email, the message.

### **Abi**

The three ladies that you see, because you mentioned about the women [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5195s) suppressed in there, the reason we're out here is because we wouldn't be suppressed. Well, I could talk for myself anyway, and certainly say Jackie, and I can certainly say Anne and Ross, female, but you know, you're of the same...

### **Ross**

I'm gay, so it counts, I think.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5217s)

And Ross, and Ross was proud of it and wouldn't be suppressed, and they don't like it, do they, Ross?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5226s)

And it took a hell of a lot of fight to get to where we are. And like, I've only just started on my journey compared to Anne and Jackie and Ross, and it's really hard going because we still live in the same village as we did, in the same house as we did, and they're right in your face. And I love rubbing myself back in their face. I mean, it's brilliant. I mean, one of the mums has literally moved school because I said hello to her every morning. Her child was in the same class as mine, and just because I said hello and I made a point of it, she's moved her child to a different school.

But it is tough. It is really tough. And especially like the things that I'm fighting for and you're fighting for with your children, as in I was sexually abused and fighting against the sexual abuse that's still happening, tiny children in there, it's everything out of you. So Jackie, I take my hat off, Jackie Davies, I take my hat off to stand up to those people because it takes guts.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://youtu.be/qL4YlelBASU?t=5307)

Yeah. And just as an aside, going back to what you made a joke about a voodoo doll, I wouldn't be surprised if at this moment they're actually praying for your removal because that's what they're doing. They're doing that for me. Not working.

### **Abi**

Not working.

### **Jackie Davies**

They might have a bit of a problem because I went to a spiritualist a few months back, actually, before this happened, and I've got guardian angels looking after me, so I don't really worry. If it's my time to go, it's my time to go, and that's my attitude. You know what I mean? It's nothing what they've done. If it happens, it happens. I just think like, I just feel that their control that they've had, I mean, I feel sorry for you, Abi, and obviously I don't know full stories of Jackie and Anne, but just listen to you, the hardest part for you, I think for all of you inside, is who do you trust? You know, who, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5361s) know, must be a heck of a situation you were in, not knowing who would really, who you could trust enough to say, "I want, I need to get out of here."

### **Anne Hamilton**

Nobody. Nobody. You can't trust anyone. Nobody. And you have to live in your head with that.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5377s)

It's awful though, it is, isn't it? I mean, you say that, but then there's obviously, I don't know how many is out of there now, but there is a lot, there seems to be quite a few of you all come out and you've been able to join together.

### **Abi**

Yeah, which is evil and opposed and this and that. No, actually, we're fighting the good fight and we're fighting for what's true. I mean, there's sexual abuse cases in Newtown, so, and I know of [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5407s) personally, so they can't be like, "Oh, we're different from all that," because no, you're not.

### **Jackie Davies**

No, that's shocking. That's disgusting.

### **Ross**

It's the fighting that my party keeps me going, because obviously I try and fight against the homophobia you're in there, and it does, it gives you a drive to, you know, see, see it through and keep going, really.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5433s)

And the other thing I want to add to what Abi said, because leaving is hard, but we all know there's people in there that are trying to leave and they're right on that cusp. You know, we all of us get contacted periodically and they're right on that cusp. And to try and describe to somebody who hasn't been through it, what it's like to be on that, "I want to leave," you've been there, oh, we've all been there. But there's people currently [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5463s) that situation, and they've got this huge pressure coming onto them from one side that gives them wobbles every second of the day.

And then they do talk to ex-Brethren, and I would add, that is their choice. We never, I mean, I would never force somebody in there to talk to me. It is their choice to, and if they said they didn't want to talk to me, I wouldn't contact them. And that mental yo-yo can actually destroy some people, and it takes such strength to work through that, [doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5493s) it? So I'm saying that for anybody inside that's listening, basically, you've got the strength.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5498s)

It's worth every day of fight once you get there. Yeah, I mean, for me, the hardest things, or for our family, the hardest things have been completely cut off from any family and any friends. Once you get over that, you run like the wind. And don't get me wrong, you still have everyday struggles because that's what life's about. Life is hard. Life is, it throws whatever it can at you, especially [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5534s) survivors. We have to fight for every breath. And yeah, once you make that move and contact us, we are not gonna make you leave. We're not gonna encourage you to leave. We're here for both sides of the corner, or I am anyway.

And to anybody in there, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do, but it's also the best thing you'll ever do. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5565s) about freedom in hymns, and they don't, it's really sad to me, like I was flicking through the hymn book the other day and I was like, they're literally singing about being free and freedom and stuff like this. They don't know what it is like to have true freedom, whether through Christ or whatever perspective you want to put on it. I'm still a Christian, but I'm still free through [Jesus,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5595s) and I'm still out here. I'm still going to be saved. I'm still a Christian. There's a lot to think about, but we're here. Like, I'm, I do talk to a lot of people and I'm here for anyone that wants to.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5611s)

So Jackie, the situation at the chapel at the moment, they've started to... sorry, that was a bit of a sideline.

### **Abi**

No, no, not at all, it's fine, Abi. It's a conversation, that's what happens. That's what it's about.

### **Jackie Hart**

Yeah. And the situation at the chapel now, they've started to restore it. What do you think is going to happen next? Do the residents, I mean, obviously we've heard your opinion on what they're doing and your concerns about how they might restore it. What do you think will happen ultimately, speculating?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5650s)

I think I'm probably going to get an email telling me, "That's all you're going to have done now. You're mingling with the ex-Brethren, we're no longer speaking to you." Yeah, yeah, that I can imagine. Yeah, I did say something like, "Yeah, I know what you lot are like," something like that to those words when I did bump into him. "Oh yeah, I know exactly about you lot." And he was like, I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5680s) know.

We, as I said, he knows what we've asked for, and I think the next, I mean, obviously I haven't sent him over the photographs that I've actually had, and my next step is to send over to Ben, possibly tomorrow morning, actually. And I'm going to send a lengthy email. I'm going to say, "Well, what are you going to do? What is happening? You know, what is the next step?" Because we would like to know. Yes, I am going to obviously ask them about equipment to find the deceased, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5711s) know, where they are, so they can put the headstones on correctly.

We have written to Powys County Council asking, because if you actually look, to be fair, a lot of the comments on the social media page, the Facebook page, under those photographs, they're pretty, you know, interesting comments, if you like, and they are asking the right questions. So what we will be doing as well is putting a post up tomorrow again, saying, "Please contact Gwilyn Davies, Powys County Council, who's the head planning officer." And please, you know, if they want, if somebody needs help with a template letter, we can get one sorted for them.

And you know, we're happy because obviously you do have people who struggle in aspects of doing that and don't know what to do. They want to get involved, they haven't got, that's fine, don't worry about [it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5760s) We can send over the information, we can help you. Because I think they didn't like that they were getting bombarded with emails. In fact, they made a reference to that, not the Brethren now, Powys County Council, they weren't happy with it. Tough luck.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5775s)

Yeah, absolutely. If you're going to support such applications, then expect the consequences from the people, because at the end of the day, it's the people on this side of the fence that are going to be knocking on the doors [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5791s) demanding answers. And as I said, this has opened up, I think this has opened up a big can of worms, to be fair, locally. Have you got security on your house?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5800s)

Yes.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5801s)

Good.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5802s)

Yeah, yeah, we've got security. We've got four of those horrible things they don't like. Dogs. Oh, yes. Those horrible creatures. I wouldn't want to mess with two of them. And they're very, very protective of the...

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5817s)

I've just got one question. There was an article in the County Times on the 21st of September, and it says in there that the Dolafon Gospel Hall Trust who own the chapel and their agent, Ian Price, have been told by the council they must reduce the size of the vehicle access gateway, install a pedestrian gate, reduce our standing area, and remove the fence post within the graveyard within the next 14 days. I wanted to know, has, have those fence posts been removed yet or not?

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5850s)

Fence posts did get removed, yeah. They are out of their [headstones,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5862s) and they didn't do the work within 20, I think it was a bit, it's been about a month, I think it has, but they have done it, and that was because the contractor they did use was on holiday. Okay. Yeah, so they have done that. Pedestrian gate, what, sorry?

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5878s)

Pedestrian gate.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqL4YlelBASU%26t%3D5880s)

The pedestrian gate isn't there, I don't think. Yeah, I think not, looking at those pictures, I think they've still got those big gates. I haven't been up there since, been away and I've come back. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5892s) I think they've still got the big gates, and that's where I'm a bit, because one of those graves are very, very close to the opening of the gates when they open into towards the chapel. So that's obviously a question, you know, basically we've got to get our answers again now on the further work they've actually done, you know, which we do need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, that would be the way forward for it.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5915s)

Well, Jackie, thank you so much for giving up your time to tell us what's happened up at the chapel. And what I also, and I sincerely mean this, I want to thank you from the ex-Brethren community, because what you've done, you've kind of given us strength, because we are used to being told we're bitter, we're opposed, and sometimes you end up thinking, almost not believing that, but almost thinking, "Are we?"

But when somebody who was very tolerant of this group and accepted them just the way [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5945s) are comes up against them and realize the kind of bigotry they're having to deal with, I find that really heartening. And I don't mean that in a derogatory way, I mean that in a way that, yeah, we've been on the receiving end of that. And thank you for highlighting it, because the way you've raised awareness through your campaign for the chapel has kind of helped the whole cause, if you see what I mean.

And I also hope that [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=5976s) in areas where the Brethren have bought buildings start to ask questions and look a bit more closely. I'm not anti the Brethren having meeting halls, but I am anti them pushing through planning application in what appears to be an underhand manner and not sticking to the planning application that's been agreed. So sincerely, thank you so much, Jackie. I think you're a real trooper. I think we all go for that, wouldn't we? And we would love you to come back on and give us [an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=6006s) update as and when it's, you know, anything happens.

### [**Jackie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=6009s)

No, that's fine. Yeah, hopefully something will, but yeah, I will do. Thank you. Thanks.

### [**On-site Videographer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL4YlelBASU&t=6028s)

Right, I'm between, where am I, how can I explain this? This is between Kerry, Sarn, on a back road towards Abermule, not far from Newtown in Wales. And what I've seen in the paper, a bit of a come on, quite, I don't know what's been going on, but something about this church house or his church, and is a respondents about putting a path over gravestones, and here it is. Oh, gates open. Got closer personally.

So we put a driveway, this is what was underneath. Oh wow, so you can come to the graveyard. Oh wow, so if that grave's positioned here, is it underneath? Wow, don't people like to do what they want to do? Amazing. Look at the graves well, are you? 1932, 84 years old. Oh wow. Yeah, so somebody would have come here and just make a mess of it all, have they? Well, I just thought I'd come have a look at myself and to see what... What do you think? Do you think they've gone and done what they say they've done? I'm not insinuating anything, I just want to see what's happened.

Let's have a look at the outside. The church is there. I haven't read up much on it, but I just thought it was in the paper, so I thought, come and have a look. Yeah, put the glasses on so you can see what dates on these. Quite old, aren't they? 1901, are you? July 19th, 14th, 1901\. Another one here, 1885\. Sarah James. I hear that from, daughter of Sarah J. What's the oldest ones here? 1891, I think. Edith Dore, 1943, I think that says. 1930\.

It's not like you can walk around here, can it, because the fencing is all in the way. Sort of cornered his whole locker. Can't let his stand and look properly. Look what the laws are on this. 1956, they're that old the graves, are they? 1932, Hannah, 1929\. They're old, some of these people. 1914, it's an old one. It's one of you, pretty recent, 1988, our priest, yeah. I don't know. Has it spotted? Have they done anything wrong? I don't know. Why did they redo the pathway? All the way around it. I can't see the same on the camera probably, but it's amazing. I'd like to build a house here.

So it's Hodley, so they're saying that they put a driveway over gravestones or moved them or whatever. I just thought, well, I'm in the area, might as well have a look around. You can see, but somebody's spent a lot of money on it. There you go. Quite a big plot of land as well. Yeah. Look at those old church houses. I don't know whether it's been renovated into a house or what's going on. Looks like they're being water in here as well. Outhouses and anyway. I've got my little bit on it. See what you think. Nice evening. Don't ask me what the date is, keep forgetting. 9th September 2023, there you go. All have an opinion.

Anyway, I think I've done a little bit there, not much more I can say really. Access to it all, not much more to see, but there's a lot of renovations. Anyway, see what happens. It looks like they want to call me it all off to make it awkward for you to get to see these stones. So where did I do that bit? We've been a bit tight and didn't do some of these family on this bit before I go. Who is it? Beloved wife of Richard Owen, 1881, or I didn't look at you, did I? 1932, Mary Jane Owen. Edward Caulfield. 1870, 1891, 1887, so these are pretty old. Caulfields families or something, just like a private Caulfield, because Caulfields were quite a family I heard about when was that, so Walsh, many years ago.

Caulfields, yeah, it's like a whole family side here. Another Caulfields, so yeah, definitely a family thing, 1905, Richard and Jane. Edward Caulfields, oh right, so I get the pattern now, it's all Caulfields, so it's a family plot. Wow, didn't notice that when I first came in. Now I've seen it. There you go, so that's always why we're using uproar. Upsetting somebody else's plots. Anyway, that's all I'm gonna say really. See what the outcome comes. It's only the County Times. I wanna see the edition for this month. Yeah. Family graves, eh? No wonder somebody's pissed. You bury them all together for a reason.

Right, I'll leave it at that. Tell me what you think. You think it's bloody rude to do that fence too close to the sides of everywhere? Tell me in the comments. Tell me what you think. And we'll come back. See what happens. Bye for now.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
