## Summary

Dare to question translations of the Bible you are being taught! How deep has the doctrine of Bruce Hales gotten inside the PBCC? Do they choose the word of Bruce over the teachings of the Bible? Do they believe they are the only ones with special light while labelling themselves a Mainstream Christian Church? If King Lemual was not supposed to drink because he's a King and leader, how is it that Bruce Hales feels comfortable drinking excessively as leader of the PBCC group? The Bible tells a husband to love his wife as Christ loves his assembly-does that condone a husband tossing his wife down the stairs? Did you know that in Bruce Hales' eyes, if you're not prosperous-God is not with you?? Join our discussion with special guest Peter Hart as we breakdown some of the fallacy taught to PBCC members. Eye opening discussion is sure to keep you entertained!!

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Hello everyone, we are back with Peter, who said we would be. Only this time we are going to dive into some stuff that I've had fall onto my lap through ex-members, listeners and viewers that have been wanting us to address. One of the main things is the misrepresentation of scriptures, teachers and we are just going to [dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=30s) into a lot of things in this podcast with everybody's help here including Peter's we hired him on for this part and so I'm going to hand the mic back over to Peter and let him kind of introduce what we are what we are about to dissect.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=52s)

I hope you'll give to me in the care meeting Cheryl. Pardon? I hope you'll give to me in the next care meeting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=58s)

I will, I will. I have about $25 here. Since we're not getting paid for these podcasts, I don't have a lot of money, but I can, I will. The next care meeting $25 is going to get allocated to you. If I start getting paid, I'll be able to make that more.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=74s)

Is that Canadian?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=75s)

I listened to a care meeting recently. I listened to one recently and maybe one day we can release parts of it. It's just so boring, but really you can tell it's just like a mafia thing where they just give out their money. They're like, we have $800 to give out. Okay, 100 to so-and-so, 100 to this big leader, 100 to this big leader, 100 to this big leader. And they just go through the list and just divvy out the cash, mafia style. To a church that has no hierarchy.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=107s)

I don't know where you want me to start but um...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=110s)

Well yeah just just pick it yeah go ahead.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=114s)

Well I went to a to another church very soon after leaving in fact when I was only still shut up I went to another church and actually it just come to mind now we had this guy turn up at this church and one of the people at the church was really suspicious of him she she wondered if he was a private investigator and she asked him who he was and sort of grilled him and [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=144s) wondered to this day if he was sent along there to see if I was there and to follow me because you know we had private investigators but anyway just getting off topic a bit. 

Yeah I really I went to this Baptist church and apparently a lot of ex-brethren do go to Baptist churches because it's quite similar to brethren churches except one of the first things I noticed was there's no hierarchy you know there's two sets of pastors there and that they sort of take turns and when the the off pastors are not up front they're just sitting anywhere and there's no there's of course there's a front row but there's no [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=189s) people in the front row people are just sitting anywhere but the the sermons are interesting really interesting compared to the brethren ones are the brethren is just really lame um. 

But the the brethren are limited to their own JND bible and they're limited to their own set of ministry which is pretty limiting I mentioned this on the last podcast but I used to print CDs and DVDs and we had a church customer so I listened to them and that was like my first introduction to other church services but one thing I'd like to say about the JND translation it's it's pretty accurate but it doesn't [always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=242s) give you the best meaning you've sometimes got to you know read other translations to help get the best meaning and that's something I did over quite a long period of time in the in the brethren church.

One example is 1 Timothy 6 verse 5 about about money and keep in mind that that Bruce has said that if you're not being prospered it's a sign that God is not with you [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=273s) it's a bit like the prosperity gospel it's it's not biblical it's not it's definitely not true I mean I know plenty of pious people that aren't rich and if you read JND's translation it just says the JND bible says holding gain to be the end of piety but if you read the King James version it says I'll read the first bit too it says the first disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness.

So if you have a good look at that it says that that men that say that that gain is godliness are men of corrupt minds. so have a good look I'd say to anyone in the church, be a bit adventurous have a good look at other translations and dare to question it's the only way out it's the only way to to to really get other meaning of scriptures or to get the true meaning of scriptures is you've you've got to deal the question because if you don't you'll just be stuck into this retort of just listening to the same old thing and [believing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=358s) the same old thing.

That's one thing I'd like to start with anyway and there is a version of the bible called the message version actually which is which a lot of people present would say is just far too modern but it's actually written by quite a learned scholar and it's written in really modern language so that's also a good reference a lot of Christians read it but they [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=388s) back to the you know other versions anyway it's just it's just another reference.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=394s)

And I think that's one of the biggest downfalls in there right is that they they stick to the just their minimal perceptions and translations of what Bruce Hales or who the man of God is at that point in time and they don't go outside of that right I mean in your case I mean you were referring back to leaders that came before them and were pretty much shunned for it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=419s)

You know that's another big problem they have in there is that is that they say well you can't compare old ministry to new ministry it's a real issue in there and like I was quoting old ministry at one stage and just about got kicked out for it because they say oh no you can't do that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=440s)

Um well that isn't that similar to they say you can't you know compare a new testament to old testament yeah I guess.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=447s)

It's a similar idea yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=450s)

Um but really it's just because they don't line up, right because one guy says one thing and the other the other thing says the next leader in the church says is another thing if you compare them they don't add up that's why you're not allowed to compare them.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=465s)

Well it's partly because Bruce Hales was pretty ignorant like we talked the last time about the the system days so in the system days bible teaching is a big thing and and after the system days you know in the 70s the system days was despised as for the Hales despised so people also despise bible teaching and so  I  grew up you know [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=495s) was born in 68 and growing up through my teen years and 20s I grew up through the 70s and 80s and we had older brethren that knew the scriptures and the meetings I called them were interesting and we had Bible teaching. 

Not from Bruce's age group but from older people than him. Come the year 2000, Bruce throws all those people out and brings in the younger generation, his own age group, with money. They become the leaders, they take the meetings and they become lame. They're just uninteresting and boring. There's no teaching. All they can do is quote old ministries and they actually travail themselves all the time. And part of the reason why they don't like comparing old ministry to the new ministry is because Bruce is always mucking it up. um.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=560s)

Yeah I think if you take like an overhead view part of the reason they don't want you to do bible studies you know with groups of people or or really learn the bible is if you actually learned it they couldn't control what you yeah what you know so they have to keep it a top down system or they can't control what you learn and what you know.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=581s)

Yeah yeah so the people that get asked to take meetings I can talk about quite recently but the people in one thing where I came from that got us to take meetings with quite often young people that would just get a white book they would read the scriptures that Bruce read before the meeting like the day before they would bring around their friends and tell them what what reading they were going to read from the white book they told their friends [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=612s) their friends had all they'd memorized some quotes to say in the meeting so all their friends would pipe up during the meeting and do quotes the meeting would be about 15 minutes long so you hear what I'm saying wow yeah and that's the meeting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=631s)

And but but sorry wouldn't you would do the same thing eventually it was 365 days a year let's remind the listeners the Plymouth Brethren do bible teachings every single day that's a lot. Bible teachings but it's not bible teaching yeah it's not bible teachings but yeah. What you call it then propaganda.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=658s)

They do church meetings every day.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=660s)

Meetings, yes, but that's what they're claiming. Yeah, Bible teaching is giving them a little bit more credit than they deserve. I wouldn't even...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=668s)

Call them Bible teachings lame. There was a little game I used to play quite often. I would count, I'd look at my watch and count how many minutes it was that we would talk about the scripture before we just started talking about Bruce Hales and John Hales, and it was normally about four or five minutes and then we will be talking about John Hales and Bruce Hales yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=691s)

I'm I'm explaining this as a listener to a listener that doesn't know this right a listener doesn't know it doesn't know the difference between someone talking necessarily really educatedly about the bible yeah yeah yeah yeah hang on about John Hales it's the same thing to them. But they don't know the Bible at all. They don't know. Which they should because they read it every single day. Every single day they study this book. They should know it very, very well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=725s)

You know, I'm, I'm okay, we have a list here that we're going through and I want to, let's let's stay on track with this list because there's lots to get through. So I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna go ahead and start reading this next point. and then you guys can jump in so this is just this is perfect because we're we're talking about this the brethren seem to think they own scripture interpretation. Let's go on to this one Peter do you want to do you want to do you want to take that one away?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=755s)

Yeah so yeah well I suppose I could use an example I mean yeah they think they can put their own interpretation of anything yeah I can remember asking my father-in-law about particular scripture it was I think it's 1 Corinthians 7 where it says that if a if a wife is an unbeliever her husband should should dwell with her so therefore you know if a if there's a husband a wife and one's a believer one's [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=789s) then they should they should live together and I can remember asking him well why do brethren separate marriages you know if one of them leaves the fellowship why does the other one stay in the fellowship? Why can't they both go and he said oh well that scripture you know JT said or something that scripture was written to a particular assembly at a particular time for a particular set of circumstances. So therefore we don't go by that scripture.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=825s)

They have a convenient answer though to everything really, you know, it's, you know, who was it JT Jr. that was caught in the bed with the woman, you know, my parents explained it as he was trying to bring out the non-believers and the people that doubted, right? Bruce Hales is talking about that right now. I just heard that yesterday in church, he's talking about having faith in the assembly right through to the end, how terrible it would be if you were lost.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=854s)

Yeah, so every scripture has to be taken. You've got to think about every scripture, who it was written to, when it was written, and all that. I guess that's what he was saying, the brethren interpret that scripture. And I guess I'm sort of saying the same thing in a way, but who are the brethren to dictate all that? Another example, I guess, is all the scriptures about money. The brethren have their own interpretation on that. And they use a candid response about money. They say, oh, it's needed for the testimony. So that just overrides everything that scripture says about money. They have their own interpretation on that. What was your original what did you say sure they own the interpretations?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=905s)

Yeah the brethren seem to think they own scripture interpretation and you know what I think you there's just some really good points in here it's like the brethren take what they want and leave what they want and basically abuse the scriptures to suit their own agenda and that's what they do. It is 100% what they do they it's and in comparison I'd like to give this to to both you and Carman in your comparison with having your experience within the PBCC and then heading out to another church do you find that other churches do the same thing?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=940s)

No right I thought that strictly honest.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=947s)

Yeah yeah if a preacher stands up and preaches a message you could go home and look up that scripture in just about any commentary and you'll find that what he said lines up with almost any commentary out there it's not going to line up with the way the brethren preach that message but it'll line up with almost any commentary.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=967s)

Yeah yeah I find that strictly honest and I was told that oh other bibles have left this scripture that scripture out of I was I was still looking for bibles that do that and I've found every bible out there that I've I can't find any bible that's left anything out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=984s)

And see that to me that's what a church should be you should be able to go to all these different churches and the the message be the same coming off of that scripture right it shouldn't change through leaders it shouldn't change through times it shouldn't have all these warped interpretation from from one scripture. If it's written over a thousand years ago two thousand years ago a little less I mean of course there's going to be misinterpretations I mean they can't even they couldn't even fathom our language now compared to then so how can we expect it to even make sense now kind of blows my mind.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1028s)

Yeah but I mean I mean that the brethren just take it to another level of their mis- they misrepresent it and misinterpret it to meet what they need to meet in that circumstance. They only read the parts that they like, they only read the parts that they think support this weird idea that they have and they're like, ooh does that link? They love to say that in these in these bible teachings. Does that link? That is just a weird way of trying to say how can we relate this old book to today and they come up with the most ridiculous ways of relating it to today and they're absolutely nonsensical and I think any [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1071s) preacher in any modern church would blow them out of the water on even the simplest scripture.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1080s)

That's right, Lane. I mean, the brethren think that they've sort of ride up there with scripture knowledge, but it's just they're so not. And I mean, just take a basic example of the brethren saying that we can be perfect. And I couldn't get my head around that one. and they quote all these scriptures about perfection and you know we can be perfect John Hales was perfect and and he's like Christ was perfect and all that and they quote all these scriptures you just need to look at the greek word the original greek word to perfect and the original greek word means complete or finished it doesn't mean perfect like Christ is perfect it's just so basic that's just basic stuff and and you just look [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1130s) up on on Google you learn those things in five minutes and the brethren think they're clever they're not they're just really ignorant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1140s)

They really are because like and that's why you know well that's a result I should say of of limiting their access to information that's why the brethren have to run their own schools and their own schooling systems that's why they have to use blackout markers to in the books to hide information and to limit your internet access that's why they have to have streamlined three so that you you can't learn this information because if you learn more you'll realize that [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1170s) have no idea what they're talking about.

### [**Peter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1171s)Say hi to... [**Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1171s)

Yeah you know I can remember being out for a meal with this brother in his like 30s and he was saying he was saying oh look we really don't need to it seems like we really don't need to know much about the bible these days we really all we really need to know about is the lives of beloved Mr Bruce and Mr John Hales and I thought you poor ignoramus, I mean honestly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1195s)

Yeah yeah  I  just I pray that my parents are listening to this and I just want just just take a moment right here right now and just stop and listen to what Peter just said like how you can't you can't you just you can't take a bible push it to the side and install men in place of it you cannot remain a Christian church [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1226s) doing that.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1227s)

Yeah and then another person very close to me I won't name him but he said oh it's not what the bible says but it's what Mr Bruce is so it must be right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1240s)

Like are we listening to this like just like that's I'm just like I hope people are hearing this like when you hear us talking about it and you're listening to it that it might have some aha moment or an epiphany or your bubble might pop a little bit on how insane that sounds. I think I think if like regular if normal people just could hear a brethren member like like maybe on a recorded mike because they never do it in public, but actually talk about Bruce Hales and and and how his word is is from heaven. If you could actually hear one of them talk about it, you'd be like, who are they talking? This is insane because they talk like he's Jesus today. Yes. Like an actual miracle human being, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1288s) a North Korean talking about Kim Jong-un. Like, Kim Jong-un does not get the poo and pee, they say, you know? That's how insane these beliefs are about Bruce Hales. They literally believe that he is probably on par or above Jesus Christ.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1304s)

Well, that's what it's like, and that's why the readings became repeats of the White Book. I had a conversation with someone about why can't someone take a reading spontaneously why can't they think about a scripture and read about it and we talk about that scripture and they said but but the white book's the current word of the lord and so that's far better than having exercise about a scripture because it's the current word of the lord.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1333s)

So they've gotten past the bible. Yeah  I t just it just makes me sick to my stomach just talking about it like I can't it's just it's just sounds so absurd yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1344s)

Let's really they might as well just have everyone be quiet and just play recordings of the meetings with Bruce Hales because I mean that's what it's coming straight from the world's mouth isn't it they're just human tape recorders they're just parrots.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1357s)

Like it's it's it's no different I'm sorry it's actually no different than someone being like I talked to an alien intelligence and he tells me what to do you know he's from planet he's from planet Zing-wai-ding and uh yeah he's got spacious over there he talks to me every day he tells me how to run stuff and if if you had 50,000 people believe that you could talk to a space alien that's amazing that's [bravo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1387s) you know how fast that that that group would be reported. Right everyone would laugh at them and and the fact that people don't laugh at the at the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church more is is kind of like I don't think they know about them enough yet and hopefully we can fix that because when you do it's quite funny they're not the crimes they commit but they're their biblical stuff quite funny they're really dumb.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1412s)

Okay let's let's let's dive into our one of our first they're the main the main scripture you want to dive into right to Timothy two. first of all I want to I want to just point out here that the the new Bruce Hales got the Bible was redone what was that 2008? Where's Timothy that in the New Testament?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1441s)

Was it was it 2008 Richard?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1444s)

I think about 2000 2003 or something was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1448s)

It three okay so um...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1450s)

It's been redone lots of times it's like reprints.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1453s)

Okay and they they actually they took out the parentheses right I had somebody from the inside send it to me she had no clue and because it the the bible previous to that had the parenthesis the the the square brackets the square brackets of I just have to go to her note and what scripture are we talking about sorry I want to bring it up. Drawing from iniquity. To Timothy. What to Timothy two verse 19 at 19 on.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1485s)

First first 21 is the one with the brackets Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1489s)

Yeah. And so she sent me a picture of her new Bible that they got back in 2000 and whatever, and that's removed out of it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1498s)

Yeah. Yeah. So I've got a 1986 Bible. And if you read 1st 21, it says, if therefore one shall have purified himself from these, and then it's got in brackets, and separated himself from them. So JND, when he translated the Bible. I have the JND version right here and it does not have the parentheses or brackets. Okay, yeah. So when JND put those words in and separated himself from them, he put them in, he added them in, and he wanted the reader to know that he added them in. They were in the original translator. And so he put them in brackets so the reader would know that he added them in. So after about 2000, the brethren removed those brackets, basically saying that is original scripture.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1555s)

You're telling me this book has been edited\! Yes. My point to the person that I was talking about.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1562s)

I'll also read you something, Lane, from Revelation 22, verse 18\. Yeah, sorry, Revelation 22, verse 18\. I testify to everyone who hears words of the prophecy of this book. If anyone shall add to these things, God shall add to them the plagues which are written in this book. And if anyone take from the words of this book of this prophecy God shall take away his part from the tree of life so it's pretty bad to take away from the book so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1597s)

Yeah talking to this insider I said to this person I said from my understanding your guys's latest reprint has had an edit did you know about that and she's like I gotta I'm like I gotta talk to my dad and the father didn't even know about it like that's what I'm just saying at how easily something can come in out of a print with an edit I'm not I don't even want to get into what was edited it's just the purpose that it was edited and nobody knew.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1622s)

Do you want another edit I got another edit for you uh 2 Kings 8 26 uh the JND Darby version Ahaziah was 22 when he became king in 2 Chronicles 22 verse 2 in the King James version it says he was 42\. so there's a discrepancy but JND Darby's version has changed that 42 back to also match a 22 in chronicles but if you look in the other King James version and other bibles it's 42 [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1653s) that's another little edit JND did.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1658s)

Anyhow okay so where were we going with this. This is their main scripture that they base their their the whole separation from which is fine like you know what I mean have this have this rule in whatever way you want but don't do it in the way that you're doing it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1680s)

Yeah yeah I mean some churches have have various standards of separation that's okay I mean all all of us would still be in there if they were a honest church well I don't if all of us would be. I would still be in there if they were honest. But I mean I didn't mind separation to a point, but they were dishonest and Bruce was saying all these wrong things. I think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1711s)

There's more than just the dishonesty. There happens to be the fact that they are hiding child molesters and that they have gone on with physical and sexual abuse of children rampantly throughout the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Let's not forget that. That's a serious crime.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1727s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well of course a lot of churches do but they're hiding it too, you know. We're probably getting a bit off topic here. We are. What I'm trying to say is different churches have different standards and I don't have a difficulty with a church having a certain standard. But what I would say is that if you have a true higher standard you're just going to block people out oh what does Jesus want he wants to save people doesn't he.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1762s)

Any kind of separation thing like that I'm you cannot convince me that it is not a self-righteous judgmental attitude of underlying subconsciously I am better than you that is why I can't eat with you that is why I can't drink with you that's why I can't hang out with you Why we can't be friends? Because I am special and you aren't. That's literally what the subconscious is behind that. Yeah. Well, I want to ask brethren members a question. I've got some, they read the Bible every single day, so they should be able to answer this very easily. So let's go with an easy one. Where's a nice easy one? 

Okay, I've got a problem. So 1 Kings 4.26, it says King Solomon had 40,000 or stalls. In 2 Chronicles 9.25, it says King Solomon had 4,000 stalls. I would like to know which one it is. And they are the experts. So I expect a very speedy response. If they could email these answers tomorrow to info.getalifeatproton.me, that would be great. Also, let me ask another one. this is this one's in Genesis 6 19 uh the animals go into the ark it says two of every sort and then in Genesis 7 2 it says clean beasts thou shalt take thee by sevens and fowls by sevens I want to know if it's twos or sevens please please answer that one. Oh ah this one's this one really gets to me so how did Judas die because in Matthew 27 5 it says Judas hangs himself in Acts 1 18 it says he got a field with his blood money uh then fell headlong burst in the midst and all his bowels gushed out that is a very different death than hanging yourself so please answer me that one. Okay I told you they weren't going to be fun questions. They're not going to like them because they can't answer them. And that's I could go on all the I could go on longer like it's there's so many things that they cannot answer because they actually don't even read their own bible like Peter's been saying All they do is read this ministry that is each, each ministry from every one of these leaders in this church has just been their interpretation. And these are not educated men that have backgrounds in history or anything. They're, they're, they're [really,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1939s) really not smart when it comes to the Bible. I'm not a Christian. I'm not even a believer. And I still 100% what Peter Hart is saying, I support it because they don't even know their own teachings. They don't even understand what they're saying. That’s my rant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1964s)

Every podcast, we have to have Lane have his rant. It's the free part. Yeah, it's the free part. It is. You can cut it out later. No, we charge for everything else. Gotta get paid somehow. Right? Okay. Let's go back. Carman, you want to go into this 2 Timothy 2 at all?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1987s)

No, I think Peter cleared it up. All right. I mean, it's a plain fact. They edited it. It changes the whole meaning of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=1996s)

Yeah. And I mean, let's go into how much, I mean, you know, you can now eat with business colleagues. You can rent or even own a building with shared facilities. You can join associations. There's some really good points here. And speaking of standards in a church, do you really want a church that is so apparently pure it is limited to a few elite members and can't reach out to the needy? Why not open your doors and save some people? Maybe save yourselves even. Couldn't have been said any better. Yeah. Okay. Let's go into the next one. Do you want to go do you want to start going into that one do you have this Carman which one is that?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2038s)

Ephesians Ephesians 5 verse 25\. This is the one this is yours that is their favorite one to circumscribe they only read part of it and the the part of it I heard it so many times I could just about say it in my sleep about what about wives being submissive 22 too. So they talk about the first part of it, all about the wives being submissive, but they forget the second part.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2065s)

It's in brackets though, so was that added?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2069s)

So the second part says, husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the assembly and gave himself for her. So I think this is a really important one for anybody that's inside there to really read and really think about if you loved your wife and and used the pattern as Christ loved his assembly you would not throw her down the stairs as we're hearing in these cases or you wouldn't beat her up or you wouldn't tell her to shut up and be silent you would treat her as your partner and that's the way it was meant to be right from the start.

But in order for for PBCC [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2110s) control control the the and control what their people learn and control the female part of the church they have to preach submission and they have to forget the part where Christ and the assembly is the pattern so that's my rant on that one I think it's a huge problem though because there's so much child abuse there's so much spousal abuse and it all [comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2140s) from the fact that they're not following the pattern where a wife is a partner she's not somebody to be stepped on she's not somebody that's supposed to shut up she's actually meant to be a partner it's Christ and the assembly that's the pattern.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2155s)

Yeah yeah it's a it's a team that's one thing I've noticed out in the wide world as a husband or wife or partners that it's a team effort you know it's not it's not a I mean it's in the bible wives submit to your own husbands but so is a lot of other things and it's a it's a it's a team I mean you know you're both in this job in this thing together and I could never understand a poor tired wife and the husband's just a party goer and always on top of it you know obviously gets enough sleep at night he's off to his business during the day and the wife's just a worn out ref you know that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2203s) not a team effort.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2204s)

Yeah. We heard a little we heard a little clip we heard a little clip of Dean Hales on that Was it the Strive 423, whatever that thing was? Strive 23, yeah. Dean Hales is saying we need to encourage the women and encourage the sisters that they have a place in our ecosystem. Well, I have a word for Dean Hales. We were put in the ecosystem. You don't control it. You don't get to say whether we're welcome or not. We are here to stay because God put us here. Yeah. We are your partner. I don't want to be encouraged by Dean Hales that I have a place in the ecosystem. I was put here by God and he ain't gonna take me out. Yeah yeah yeah. You know they're so condescending. Yeah okay. So that was my free rant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2270s)

We might say we might seem a little awkward this podcast just bear with us guys you know laugh along with us as we go through it it's like it's been a few years since we've sat in partnership like this and discussed scripture.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2285s)

Oh you don't know how much I had to smoke to uh to sit through scripture this is not normal for me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2293s)

And so we're just we've got these notes here so we're just going to go through the notes so that you know make the less awkward seem bearable okay so here's something we talked about is about the mainstream Christian church and how JND warned against sectarianism. Richard do you want to talk about that?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2310s)

Oh yeah well JND JND has some very pointed remarks about the danger of sectarianism. And he says, the moment that you become sectarian, you're nothing. You're not even Christians. And by sectarian, sectarianism means that you give yourself a name.

 You call yourselves, you know, the Baptists or the Methodists or the Church of England. And of course, the brethren are very scrupulous about not giving themselves a name. When I was young, we were brought up to say, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2340s) know, if someone asks who you are, you don't say of Plymouth Brethren, you say we're just simple believers on the Lord Jesus, and then completely out of the blue Bruce Hales suddenly decides it's called the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which was exactly what JND warned against, and so by their own, by the words of their own founder and the originator of their doctrine, they have become nothing and they're not even Christians.

 It goes fundamentally against the very basis of their doctrine to take the name of being a church, let alone to claim to be a mainstream Christian church. Because their fundamental doctrine is that there is only one church. So to say *a* church is a denial of that in a single word.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2389s)

It's amazing. It's actually a bit of a miracle that out of the entire history of earth, that God chose this this assembly and this uh recovery as they call their church right at this time that's such a coincidence you know that right at right when they were alive uh it just happens to be the chosen the chosen one church.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2419s)

Well if you do the numbers line  I'm a bit of a statistician or whatever you call it I like I like big numbers and I used to like throwing this one into the breaks sometimes that if you take every person that's been alive like every person's ever been born since Adam that equates to I think it's about 121 billion people and if you take what the leaders of the recovery have said that most people will get to heaven what it actually equates to is that in heaven one in one million people will be exclusive brethren. And that used to cause quite a bit of interest in the breaks because the exclusive brethren sort have thought that oh you know heaven will be mostly us yeah you know and off to the side there will be some other sort of half Christians and heaven will be mostly the brethren and John Hales will be sitting next to Jesus and Bruce Hales will be on the other side and it will all be about the brethren there's [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2496s) actually just this very...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2498s)

Very very small drop in the bucket. There's more people, double as many people at the World Cup soccer games than there are in all brethren members. They're a little blip, they're a speck of dust.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2517s)

So what scripture were we talking about? Oh that's right, yeah mainstream Christian church. It really amuses me how they like to call themselves a mainstream Christian church. But they never tell anyone outside that they have special lights you never see that on their website that we have special light so out of one side of their mouth they're saying we're mainstream out of the other side of the mouth they're saying we're special yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2547s)

Yeah and that takes us into kind of our next point here talking about JND saying there's no membership of brethren or membership of an assembly but it's members of Christ's body if you asked an older brother who does Christ's body include he would say all true Christians if you ask most brethren they would say the brethren.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2570s)

Yeah interesting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2572s)

Yeah yeah go ahead Peter you can expand on that.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2577s)

No it was always a Christian I would have liked to have thrown into a meeting I was  I  I used to I said about one one hundredth of what I would have liked to have said but just to say oh who is who is Christ's body yeah the brethren thought it was them but you know the body and the assembly and the church is it was already the same thing and it includes all Christians. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2607s) not just the Brethren. And that was a teaching in the older original ministries, is that that includes all men. But you know, the Brethren have digressed into this very exclusive thing where the assembly or the church is just the Brethren only. And it didn't help it when JT Jr. said, we are the church. And so that gets repeated very often in the meeting we are the church and the brethren think that they are the only church.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2635s)

It's very damaging to someone's ego to to completely think and be told that they're special their entire lives yeah that's not good.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2645s)

You know it's funny though how they will refer to those the older ministry for specific things that empower what they're doing now right so they will...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2655s)

Yeah they will but the same time Bruce Hales has said, and I think Richard you said, John Hales has said the same thing, that it's not healthy. Bruce Hales has said it's not good to read too much of JND's ministry. Wow. Yeah. Because he knows that you're seeing inconsistencies, you'll learn too much of what JND, the inconsistency between what's been said now and what JND said. And they're not really following JND, they're not following their founder. You're not even following the Bible at this point. No, the other amazing thing that Bruce said, and you're probably choking at your coffee when I tell you this, Bruce said that we're not saying what JND said, but if he were here with us now, he would agree with us.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2710s)

Wow. That's a little thought to believe. Wow.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2714s)

And the brethren suck that up and they say well Bruce has got more light than JND. JND was a very very learned scholar. He was a brilliant man. As far as a scholar went. He must have the brain the size of Einstein. Who? As far as a scholar went. Ah yeah I mean he had quite a bit good capacity well that's my own opinion others probably I...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2747s)

Guess like my my biggest issue I have with this whole organization is the alcohol right I just I do not I mean the whole money and the business side of things right people can kind of wrap their head around oh well you know it's just a church that's wanting to you know make sure all the businesses are good enough and going and prosperous it's the alcohol like that is absolutely anybody who reads looks researches and gets inside the PBCC has got to see the problem with the alcohol inside there and you know what we go this takes us into our our next scripture that we want to talk about is first Tim one first Timothy three verse three to eight um. Who wants to go for this one this is the Carman you want to take this?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2799s)

Well this actually this one is is very commonly discussed in the Baptist church and this section it discusses deacons and pastors drinking and it actually makes it actually makes a uh a point of saying deacons can drink a little and pastors shouldn't drink at all and it goes on to say that they'll miss or they'll forget what the bible has decreed and Baptists stick pretty pretty faithfully to that their pastors don't drink so I just wondered like does Bruce has he ever read that scripture like he considers himself to be the CEO that would really apply to him or is that one the right style of the bible?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2848s)

Right and I mean he's the perfect example of that scripture of like he has forgotten.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2853s)

So so read that one out Carman is that the proverbs one?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2859s)

No that's the one in Timothy the one in proverbs is really good.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2862s)

Yeah that's the next one you go right into that one yeah. Do you want to go into it proverbs 31 verse four or five?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2873s)

Uh that's the one where he talks about uh lest they drink and forget what has been decreed yeah that's where he says the king shouldn't be drinking and he talks about king Lemuel sorry I need to look it up I didn't write it down.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2892s)

Okay probably 31 I'm reading from the brethren's own bible verse 4 31 verse 4;

“It is not for kings Lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for rulers to say where is the strong drink lest they drink and forget them all and pervert the judgment of any of the children of affliction.”

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2911s)

Yeah, it is not for kings.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2915s)

Yeah. And when you think of the power that Bruce Hales has over the lives of all his 50,000 unfortunate subjects and how he's making huge decisions that wreck and completely affect people's lives, their families and their businesses, and he's making those decisions not from a point of sobriety but from a point of drunkenness, you can see the wisdom of the scripture.

I [mean,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2947s) if you went to a courthouse and the judge was deciding whether you're going to be set free or put in prison, the judge was visibly drunk and quaffing glasses of scotch, you would be distressed and you'd feel that your chances of getting justice would diminish. But this man seems to be permanently, he's basically permanently stoned this guy.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2969s)

You don't need to worry Richard because it's all directly from Jesus out of his mouth.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2976s)

Well he doesn't need to ask where the strong drink is because half of it's in his stomach and the rest of it's in his hand.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=2982s)

I don't think a guy like that can sit with his own emotions that's why you know you have to numb it yeah he's got it he's got it yeah with the amount of things that he knows and he does that's the only way that he can deal with himself dealing with the guilt yeah yeah and if we go back up to that uh what first Timothy 3 verse 3 to 8 we talk about to the pursuing dishonest gain. Right? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, Carman.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3013s)

I mean, it says, all you have to do is read it. It talks about not pursuing dishonest gain.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3020s)

Well, that's another whole podcast. I think Sarah and I have discussed, maybe we'll be doing a podcast about dishonesty in the brethren, which is a big, big.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3030s)

But we'll just, we'll prepare them for it out of this scripture right literally of I mean we we have proof and know of where they go completely against this scripture. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3043s)

Well the funny part is on the cross reference to that one it brings up the scripture in Acts about Ananias and Sapphira and if you read through the holes the whole scripture about Ananias and Sapphira Ananias is the guy that dropped dead right and the brethren like to preach that scripture and say it's because he lied. Yeah. If you actually read the commentaries that wasn't his biggest sin his biggest sin was he sold a piece of property and he was proclaiming to turn all this money over to the apostles but he kept a little bit back for himself and his wife knew about it and she was in it with him and he made this donation so that he could look grand and generous and whatever but he kept some for himself and so when Peter confronted him [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3093s) biggest sin was the fact that he kept part of it for himself and it didn't make any sense because it was his piece of property it was his money and his biggest sin was the the conspiracy of it trying to look generous when he wasn't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3107s)

Why is that a sin to keep some back for himself?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3109s)

Well and does it sound a little bit like RRT yeah for...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3113s)

Sure but I don't think like why could the guy should have been allowed to keep some back for himself why give everything away?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3120s)

And nobody asked him to the fact of the matter is he was trying to appear grand and generous and at the end of the day he kept a little bit for himself so you think about RRT it's out there to polish their image it's out there to say we're grand and generous but at the end of the day all it is is making them more money out of the tax deduction.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3141s)

Yeah, they said recently they respond to an emergency in the world every 33 hours. Yeah. Let's tell the listeners what they really do. They show up at disasters with tents, hand out boxes of food to people working, and take pictures. That's all they do. And it's very small donations. For billionaires, they shouldn't be giving 100 boxes of food away. That's nothing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3169s)

It's basically less than one percent of their charitable income goes to the RRT.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3176s)

So go back to Ananias just for one more point here when Peter confronted him he dropped dead and most of the commentaries that you read about it say he dropped dead because all of a sudden he was exposed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3193s)

Bruce, I am literally, I'm asking again, I just want to sit down with you. I just want to sit down with you. Let's have a conversation. If you are who you say you are, you would sit down with us because all of the abuse, everything that happened, happened inside there. You have a responsibility and a duty as the CEO of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church to sit down with us and talk to us. And so I want to talk to you. You should be calling me tomorrow and be like, Cheryl, you know that conversation you wanted to have? I'm ready to have it. I'm ready to.

Sounds like you better bring a defibrillator along.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3236s)

Yeah, well, my husband's had a heart transplant, so I'm actually very well-versed in heart issues. So I would be able to…There's nothing wrong with Bruce that a head transplant wouldn't sort out. I could hook him up okay and as we talk about that let's go into this Romans 13 verse 1 2 let everyone be subject to governing authorities for there is no authority except that which God established.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3259s)

Yeah well unfortunately the brethren claim to be the highest port in the land. so they think they can be a judgment on things like things that need to go to the place they think they can judge on that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3280s)

That's awful convenient right when you when you when you're the highest court and you have sexual abuse of minors happening in your congregation in your church it's so convenient being the highest court you can just forgive and just let it go away it's just forgiven those that have come up with their claims should be contacted by from somebody inside there that's what I said nobody's contacted me and I mean we've had done numerous podcasts now where I've asked like let's let's have a conversation. 

I never had any plans in taking this to the police I had no plans at all I contacted my eldest sibling to discuss it with her this is what happens when you shove underneath the carpet over and over and over again and walk away and pretend [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3328s) not there it's you know it's funny so there's just a point underneath this this this comment this this scripture explains why it should be required to report sexual abuse child abuse spousal abuse also shows how foreign it is to to a church to be messaging its people how to get around a traffic stop set up to catch drunk drivers so funny which is true right but I mean the...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3353s)

Scripture refers quite clearly to the civil authorities to the government of the day and they they completely set this scripture aside and claim that they are a higher form of government I mean they're not just edging around this scripture they're just whitewashing it out of the bible entirely. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3372s)

Yeah. And I mean, we're here to remind you that, yeah, you are not the highest authority. And you can't claim to be the highest authority, especially when you have alcoholics as leaders that have not.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3386s)

I invite the brethren members to convince a judge that they're the highest court in the land. I would pay a lot of money to watch that argument.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3396s)

I mean if you are the highest court in the land I mean we've done how many podcasts now. Nobody has been contacted nobody that's come forward has been contacted and I mean I have people from the inside that have sent me messages uh stuff that they've gone to the brethren with that hasn't had anything done with it so I mean you if you claim to be the highest court you you're not doing your job it's as simple as that that if you're claiming this then you have to do your job.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3430s)

The sad thing is that at the bottom of all this they're trying to be Christ's representatives on earth his chosen people his pure assembly and all that yeah and that's why they shoving it all under the carpet.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3446s)

Just them and nobody else guys go home it's not working.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3452s)

I mean, I found a list on one of the, I think it's the Cult 101 website, someone's carefully put together a list of all the headlines relating to brethren, probably for the last 30 years. and then 90% are negative the remaining 10% are just ones about building new meeting halls. But there are hundreds of them, hundreds of headlines talking about sexual abuse, talking about split up families, talking about children, children's court [cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3482s) where the Brethren are trying to rip the children away and forbid parental access. It's all negative and this is actually the brethren's testimony they say they are the testimony but in fact their testimony is completely negative they dragged the name of Christ through the mud they've dragged the name of Christendom through the mud and this is this is what they are this is their testimony to the public.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3507s)

Well that's why they have to get a new PR person that's what I was just gonna read I was just gonna...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3511s)

Read their latest you know we specialize in protecting and enhancing reputations full stop.  Our expertise has been honed over many years for organizations facing various challenges, from launching products to running campaigns, from generating positive media to mitigating bad press. And sometimes we keep clients out of the media and those clients are pedophiles.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3535s)

Yeah, exactly. And that's why we're here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3540s)

I mean, what's the scripture, Peter? You know this one about being harmless and irreproachable children of God in the midst of a wicked and perverted generation. That's right. If you look at the brethren, is that what comes to mind?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3557s)

No, not at all.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3558s)

I mean, they're not harmless. They're not innocent. They're not irreproachable. They're very much reproachable. And they're supposed to be as lights in the world, while in fact, they're a scandal. They're a disgrace. People are ashamed to be associated with them, and a lot of open Brethren churches that used to use the name Brethren actually have taken it out of their name and changed their names because they don't want to be associated with the wickedness that goes on in the PBCC.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3589s)

[Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3589s) well that was one of the things I said to them as they were kicking me out. I said I'm ashamed to be associated with the Brethren anymore because of your bad testimony.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3599s)

Yes, yeah. And nearly all the worst things in terms of public testimony, the very worst and most sort of infamous and scandalous events have all been down to the actual so-called great leaders of the recovery, like Aberdeen, where Jim Taylor actually invited a reporter to his house to meet with him. He turns up on the doorstep in his underpants and then he conducts the interview with someone else's wife [sitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3630s) on his lap. That was the testimony. And then this New Zealand election. That's the testimony in New Zealand is that, oh, they hired private investigators because there's a rumor that the prime minister's husband might be gay. So they hire a private investigator, follow him around to see if they can find some dirt. What kind of testimony is that? That's all the newspaper headlines. And then in my case, they're hiring criminals and [street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3660s) thugs. This is the testimony and this is all Bruce Hales.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3666s)

They said about JTJr it was an ambush. I said to them at one stage, I think it was after I was shut up, I said to them, where in Scripture did Paul or Jesus do something bad, to appear to look bad, to trick people into thinking it was bad? Yeah. Where is that in Scripture?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3690s)

The ambush story, the thing that blows a hole in the ambush story is the original incident at Aberdeen, which was done in the presence of a lot of brethren, you could conceivably say that's an ambush, but then why six or eight weeks later does he invite a newspaper reporter to his house? Where's the ambush in that? The scandal had already gone out in the Brethren. It was just, the guy was just an alcoholic, he didn't know what he was doing, he was out of his house. And...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3719s)

What a lot of the Brethren don't realize about that Aberdeen thing was that that same bedroom stuff continued in New York afterwards. Exactly. So it didn't finish in Aberdeen. And the brethren aren't told that bit inside. So this is news for anyone that's listening. Yeah. And I also...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3740s)

He had an affair. Like, let's call it an affair. That's the easiest way to say it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3744s)

And we were talking about Trump and this before, and I actually had a letter from JT3 read out to me it was addressed to me about a year ago because I challenged JT Junior as being drunk to the brethren and JT3 wrote me a letter it wasn't given to me it read out to me. Yeah. He said that he had never seen his father drunk.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3779s)

Yeah. Well, I guess if you're the one chosen church, you can just lie and be like, well, I'm already got the VIP section. So yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3788s)

Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, that's, that's really, they have, they've got a they have a way they have a way to explain everything that's the hard part right and if you are the man of god and you've given yourself that very seated position that Bruce has done his they believe anything that comes out of his mouth right and that's what makes makes it hard for us here to to do what we're trying to do and we're just considered you know we're the wolf in sheep's [clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3818s) right and really seriously people Bruce is wearing the Bruce is definitely the wolf.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3827s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3828s)

He is the wolf I like 100 is he's the wolf in sheep's clothing yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3835s)

I think walrus clothing might be more appropriate yeah yeah yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3841s)

Do you know I was listening to those meetings recently and it was actually my grandfather John Fossey talking and he he said this phrase that I remember hearing all the time about going through extreme exercise and I just started dying laughing because nobody in the brethren has ever gone through extreme exercise ever I don't even think they know how to break a sweat.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3868s)

Oh yeah they do they break a sweat every time they climb upstairs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3877s)

Oh okay let's let's go on to the next one we might not get through all these that's okay so I think this might have been one that you had on there Carman uh Mark 9 verse 42 Matthew 18 verse 6 Luke 17 verse 2 referring to it being better if a millstone were hung around the neck of someone mistreating a widow of the fatherless children.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3900s)

Yes and if you uh look up in blue letter bible and this goes back to their treatment of the young people that's in all three of the gospels a different different a little bit different phrasing but still to offend a little one or to hurt a little one or hurt their feelings or a widow it would be better if a millstone were hung about his neck and him tossed in the sea so put [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3930s) in perspective a millstone weighs about 3,000 pounds.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3933s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3934s)

So all of these young people in Maple Creek you know that were that were put out put out of the meeting for saying a bad word stepping on the bible whatever it was that they were put out for it would be better for those that were leading that locality to have a millstone hung about their neck and then tossed in the sea. And I wonder if they ever read that because it's a pretty stern warning.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3960s)

Not to mention all the young children down to very, very young ages who've been abused and the brethren have covered it up.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=3970s)

Yeah. And if you look up the number of times, we're often told in a book when a book is written that repetition is a tool that they use to drive home a really important phrase or a really important instruction. The treatment of widows and fatherless children, there's 33 references in the King James Version to the treatment of widows and fatherless children. So how important is that? And you look at a place like Maple Creek and they were [thrown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4000s) out on the street at 12 years old thrown out on the street with the clothes on their back at 12 years old.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4011s)

And you know like something that's really been sitting with me lately is like I'm just shocked that that nobody's called me up to talk to me because they know how guilty Alan is. I mean, gosh, the amount of, the amount of, the amount of evidence, the amount of, and past with his dad and like the things that have come forward, like why would, wouldn't it just be easier to just like, let's just deal with this, right? 

Like I don't get how they can sit there [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4047s) continue to just hope that this goes away or to lie themselves out of a situation and tell Alan that he's in the clear and can go back to meeting. And I think that it's like just because no investigator or police have showed up on their doorstep that this is all okay. And not one phone call has come my way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4066s)

Yeah, that's also a very, very potent point. I mean, we're talking about their 2 Timothy 2 and it's their charter and separation from evil and so on. But what are they actually doing in Maple Creek? 

They're sitting there breaking bread with this guy. they know full well is is a serial kind of profoundly evil and they're sitting there breaking bread with this guy day after day week after week have been doing for the last 65 70 years [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4096s) you know where is the sense in their great wall of separation when they've got these pedophiles and evil people inside and they know they're there and they're having fellowship with them and yet refusing to break bread with good Christians simply because they're not actually card-carrying members of the famous Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4121s)

Well I think the overriding thing, Richard, is protecting the testimony. So that's why they don't want to expose the testimony. And that's why they'll lie to protect the testimony.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4136s)

It's a little bit late, isn't it, because the testimony went south in about 1970\.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4141s)

Well the number of meetings that Bruce Hales reads about Paul's sister's son and how he protected Paul. Yes. You know and what least would you go to protect Paul? That's the favorite one. He's saying, in other words, he's saying you would lie to protect Paul. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's not saying that right but that's what brethren believe.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4166s)

Yeah I just I mean it's just stuff like this when we get into this kind of stuff it just it just really gets me going inside of like how can how can you sit there and go to a meeting every single night and how many times on Sunday and like literally I did I did my police report at end of June came up with that podcast I mean we know that everybody heard about it as soon as it came out so that's June July August 10 October November we're almost coming up to six months six months and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4196s) nobody's nobody's contacted me. I'm okay and I do I get sad some days is because I'll just have a conversation with you I will tell you outright all of the information I know like that…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4209s)

They haven’t even confined him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4210s)

Well he I he was for a little bit yeah he was for a little bit or he couldn't he couldn't go to meeting and then because it kind of nobody went to nobody showed up on his doorstep that he is now he was told he can go back to meeting and then two days later he was back to his old game again and I think that's the thing is it's just like  I  have no issue having a conversation with you.

It's why I asked my oldest sibling to have a like let's let's have let's let's work this through [let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4240s) get this he needs to be in an institution is what he needs to be a locked up institution where he never has access to and it's not just children it's not just teens it's it's like any feet any any human he should just not have be in arm's length of...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4256s)

No you know be in a prison cell by himself yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4258s)

But he but more so he I mean it's it's an it's a institution with a…like it needs to be a prison with an institution like he yeah yeah that's a whole other podcast again anyhow let's go down to the next one because I'll get go down a rabbit hole I don't want to go down okay we still have a few more here uh Matthew 23 in the JND;

 “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:

All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,

And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.”

 I think Carman this is one of yours again no no I don't know.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4316s)

That's I put that in I think it'd be good for the brethren to read that because it's a bit prophetic it's a bit what it's like these days I see the presence of scribes and pharisees who you know buying burdens heavy and hard to bear the…Bruce Hales and all those ones at the top with all their all their vast amounts of money all this money they make out of PPE and yet they're still asking all the hard working working class of Brethren for their money all the time. And all these Brethren are working their ass off and being asked for money for the schools. And you've got all these Brethren at the top just sitting on huge amounts of wealth. I don't know why the Brethren put up with it. And the care meeting, you know, budget is huge. And when I was in there two and a half years ago, families were struggling. It's probably worse now. Yeah. It's all about asking all the time.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4388s)

Yeah, I mean, I've just got I've just in the process of transcribing their latest fundraising appeal, which was put out on a video link, which was so important that apparently as when you attended and watched this zoom video you had to be dressed in meeting clothes to watch it and this is an appeal I think for about $35 million dollars that's just for North America.

 There'll be larger sums or different areas yeah and this is and basically when you analyze it what they're going to do is they're going to take all this $35 million dollars so probably you know if it's for the whole global probably getting close to a billion dollars if you multiply that up to get you know Australia, New Zealand, Europe in. It's going to be invested in large and highly successful brethren businesses with a view to it eventually coming back to the ecosystem with some you know interest [added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4448s).

So you know it's all dressed up in flowery language and they get little children to read parts of it in you know sentimental children voices and lots of pretty pictures of the RRT. But what it boils down to, this is the very wealthiest, you know, the top 10 or 20 businesses in the PBCC, going out to everyone else, going out to the whole membership with their caps in their hand, begging for lots and lots of money, just a million dollars, please, for them to invest in [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4478s) businesses. And we all know who has fingers in the top 10 or 20 businesses in the PBCC. They're all owned by or either owned by Hales or the Hales have large stakes in them or get a profit share from them. 

So basically it's the very wealthiest businesses, the very wealthiest institutions in the PBCC, just coming out and asking for money on the vague promise that someday it might be returned. It's absolutely shocking.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4510s)

my God\! I'd say to anyone who's listening to this, if you put your money in there, you will never see it again. You might just...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4519s)

I'm convinced that they're milking the working class. Oh. All these Audi and Range Rover drivers, you know, they're milking the Kia drivers. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4532s)

Yeah. And they're snotty, I've heard. They're really snotty rich people now like they're very very arrogant and and you know talked down to people and I'm like wow like so Christian of you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4544s)

And the lowest tier the lowest tier is at the local food bank.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4549s)

Yeah but having to volunteer having pressured into getting food.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4554s)

No getting food oh. Yeah I thought you meant volunteering at their at their grocery stores. The lowest tier the old the elderly people that are supposed to be on this fixed income because they've donated all their money and they're they're having to go to the food bank to get food because they don't have enough to eat.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4571s)

And guess what happens when those old people pass away you'll you'll find that in their wills everything's left for the UBT all the they're requesting that though now. Yeah they a lot of pressure put on people to to leave all their money to the this all that trust so you know not even their children get the benefit of their legacy it's that's all supposed to go into the big pot.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4594s)

And then they've asked the farmers to sell their land sell all the the you know land that's been left to them down through the ages and put that money in the pot and then they put them on a fixed income and they don't even have enough to eat.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4609s)

Yeah they're at the food bank I'd like to quote something your grandfather said to Carman. Didn't he say sue the bastards.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4617s)

I'll be right back guys yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4619s)

I like to I like to just change it slightly I like say screw the bastards.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4630s)

Man you know they're just they're they're obsessed with their money and their their control and their own ecosystem and it's really going to be their downfall right because they they're too arrogant to admit that they've had all these terrible crimes go on, that they've kicked people out for no reason, that they've torn companies and families apart. They're too cowardly to admit that, so they're gonna, they're just gonna hide, and the police are gonna make, I think, easy work of it. So I hope. 

But I did want to, I did want to reach out to people listening inside the church in there, in case there's a couple yeah probably very few that actually question their religion and faith altogether if you want to talk about that reach out to me specifically at info[.getalifeatproton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4686s).me and we can instead of discussing you know the bible we can discuss Alan Watts we can discuss Sam Harris we can discuss Richard Dawkins and the late great Christopher Hitchens who is one of the greatest atheists. But yeah, if you want to talk about that, because I know that there's some people that question that for sure. It wasn't for me for years after I left, but I know that there's probably a couple.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4715s)

Yeah, I'd like to point people in there that want to investigate scripture or the Christianity thing. Thanks, mate. I'd like to point people to a guy called Tim Keller. Yeah, Timothy Keller. You find him on his own website or on YouTube.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4739s)

Maybe we can post the link for people when we post this.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4742s)

Yeah, okay. Yeah, he's on YouTube or he's got his own website. He's an excellent preacher who is a thousand times more knowledgeable than Bruce Hales and 5,000 times more interesting to listen to. So that's a good one to listen to. And there's heaps of resources online. I was actually amazed when I was in there that the Brethren haven't blocked a whole lot of these resources, there is a lot that you can still get to. They might have changed now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4774s)

Yeah, all we can recommend to those in there is that if you can get a device without Streamline three on it do that you know if you have questions literally just google them google them and you will find so many more resources and answers to your questions do the research take the time and and just use google and stop relying on only the brethren source of information because it's corrupted.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4802s)

Yeah be just you know what and just just be open-minded right that's the thing is allow allow yourself to be curious about what feels right to you when you take multiple different resources and see which one feels right because I guarantee you the one that has more compassion is going to resonate more.

 I want to I want to end I want to end on a really really good one here that Peter you included in here [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4832s) this is to do with the the false prophets do you want to you want to go into this last one?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4837s)

Um well in Matthew 24;

“And Jesus answered and said to them see that no one mislead you for many shall cover my name saying I am the Christ and they shall mislead many. But you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not disturbed for all these things must take place but this yet but it is not yet the end.

Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ\!’ or ‘There he is\!’ — do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and shall give great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.”

 So I found that one quite helpful when I was still in there but that might not be the one you were talking to you were talking about.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4884s)

Yeah that was the one yep. Yeah yeah yeah did you want to say any more about that?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4891s)

Well I just think it's really good in in in what we were just talking about right is be your own source of judgment be your own source, google, reflect on other people's interpretations of things because Bruce does not have everybody's he's not holding everybody's heart in [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4921s) in a right manner. 

He doesn't care about everybody he cares about his pocketbook he cares about finances you know he might show he might show you guys uh what you consider respect by what you consider to be being able to allow to do certain things and it gives you the sense of freedom. You have to understand he just maneuvers his chess pieces inside the house to make it feel like things have changed they're not changing. You're still [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4952s) you're still inside these walls of armor you're inside these walls of illusion and deception it's not what Christianity is about.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4963s)

Like in my opinion he is probably the biggest false prophet that the exclusive brethren the Plymouth brethren and the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have ever had.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=4973s)

Yeah, and he gives people freedom, he gives people freedom in their circumstances, but he's got a hold over their minds, he doesn't give them freedom in their minds, and he's constantly talking about not doubting for a second, that's what he's constantly saying, and that's what, you've just got to be brave enough to see Bruce for who he is.

 It's not hard to say he's selfish and he's unempathetic but you just got to be brave enough to think hey [maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5004s) he's wrong and that's what he's saying all the time is you can't doubt for a split second it's torture doubt is torture he's saying he's just got to be brave enough to just think outside the box and think for a second that hey maybe maybe he's he is serving us up bad stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5024s)

And you should be able to go to him with your doubts and with your like, that is that is being human, that is being human, you will have doubts you will have these things. That's what pastors are there for, that's what leaders are there for, for you to go and have and you can question a leader that's…

**Peter Hart**

The thing is the thing is Cheryl in there you can say you can say to someone I don't I just don't know about all this God stuff I don't know if I'm saved I don't know all that. But if you say I don't know if Bruce is what who he says he is, they'll they'll throw up their hands in horror yet they can handle the whole Christianity doubt they just can't handle the Bruce doubt.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5066s)

I would say to them then start small and break a rule really small do something you're not supposed to uh check out a porn mag uh do something do something naughty okay and you'll you'll see how much fun it is and how exciting and test yourself experiment on yourself say I'm gonna do this one naughty thing I'm gonna listen to a rap song oh and listen to the rap song and then be like okay if I stub my toe maybe that's God talking me and and give it 24 hours and see if something bad happens and then try something a little worse, try something a little naughtier something a little badder and you're gonna see how exciting and fun it is.

And the thing is do it now, because if one day you get out of the church all of a sudden you're going to be allowed to do all those things and it'll not be as fun so break the rules now do it now [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5121s) it like sneak stuff into the meeting room you know do it it's fun smoke some weed it's fucking amazing. Try breaking a rule. Come on, don't be a wimp. That's what I'd say.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5139s)

I'd like to quote another scripture, Cheryl, if we've got time, about all this PR work. And this is one I quoted to them quite early on about the brethren. It says, Matthew;

“Woe you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish.”

That's like the PR work;

“But within they are full of rapine and intemperance. Blind pharisee make clean firstly inside of the cup and of the dish but the outside also may become clean thus also outwardly appearing righteous to men but within, full of hypocrisy, hypocrisy and lawlessness.”

So if the brethren are right inside, they don't need all this PR stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5187s)

Yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5188s)

So they're spending all this money on making the outside of the cup clean, and they fill the inside…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5195s)

If they were really the one chosen church, don't you think the secret would have got out by now and the world would know and be trying to knock down the doors and get in? They'd be begging to get in. They'd be the one chosen church. You can't hide that from the world forever. Everyone would be trying to get in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5211s)

Yeah. Yeah I just think this was a discussion that we needed to have um. I guess I just challenge everyone who listens from inside there and also to the ex-members that get met with the cherry picking of the of the scriptures and get thrown back into their face. Listen to this and take some notes for next time that you're challenged and you know like it's okay to challenge them back it's okay to to know that their constant misrepresentation of specific quote scripture and specific leaders that they've had before it's okay to challenge them on it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5265s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5266s)

And it's okay to challenge Bruce inside there if he is truly who he says he is I can guarantee you that if Christ was on this planet right now and I had an issue and I went to him and I said you know what I heard you say this and I just I just doesn't make sense to me it It is like, I'm challenging you. I can guarantee you, he would sit me down with the utmost unconditional love and care more about my state and what I was confused about than [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5297s) defense. I guarantee it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5299s)

Yeah. The factors show that you cannot write, if you're in the room, you can't write back to Bruce. You can't talk to him. At fellowship meetings, If you're at a fellowship meeting with Bruce Hales you can't get close to him. He's got people around him and this is all specially done on purpose. The aisle that he walks out of has got two people allocated at the end of the aisle on every row that are specially put there and they're called blockers. So as Bruce Hales walks up the aisle they block people from talking to him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5336s)

Are you serious?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5338s)

Yeah, so he walks up that aisle and out with people huddled around him to his tent or to the car and so people can't talk to him. He won't answer his phone, if you get hold of his phone number, he doesn't answer it. A member of the Plymouth President Christian Church cannot ring Bruce Hales, they cannot talk to him, you cannot contact him. My wife in there, she cannot ring up Bruce Hales.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5365s)

Do you know, and I like, I just picture when the Pope came over to Canada here, right, and I mean, even he was reaching and, you know, holding hands and shaking people's hands and greeting people, right? I guess, like, what kind of, I just, what kind of priest is that? What kind of a leader is that, that you can't even get a hold of him?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5388s)

Well, he's, he's scared. He knows, he doesn't want someone out of the crowd saying, asking the hard question. Does he and if you want to talk to Bruce Hales at the fellowship meeting you've got to ask him and you'll be given a position on the end of an aisle but you'll be vetted first you've you've basically got to they've got to know what question you're going to ask him and it's all official so you can't get someone asking them a random question at a fellowship meeting you can't get someone saying hey why was my husband withdrawn from because he only did this or someone saying to Bruce Hales, you said this and it wasn't fair. He's surrounded himself with this armor of protection within his own church.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5437s)

He has bodyguards and at one meeting they asked brethren members to watch the roofs for snipers. Now that's actually hilarious and very, very funny to think that it's hot oh exactly it's it's hilarious.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5457s)

Part of his heart so the brethren believe that he's so important yeah he's so important and and believe all his stories about the house that the outs wanted to kill him I haven't met an out yet that wants to kill him. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5474s)

Yeah I just want to talk to him. I just want to have a conversation but it sounds like I might have get in line behind everybody who's still in the church. 

**Lane Admiraal**

He apparently likes boxing so  I  don't. I don't want to talk to him. I want to have a boxing match with him and I won't even use my arms. I think it's still going to be an easy win.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5494s)

Wow  I  just my mind gets blown every time we have a conversation with you Peter I'm like I have tonight I just got so much to digest.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5504s)

I suppose you think I'm making all the shit up do you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5507s)

No you can't make this shit up. No. That's what I tell people. You literally cannot make this shit up. And I mean I learnt that when I look back, when I turn around and I look back on everything I went through right, I mean a lot of people have a hard time understanding. And to me it was just, that was just what I had to do right, like it's you don't question it until you get out and you get older and you look around and you look at life and you realize that wow nobody is going to understand what I went through because it's just it's not the norm right like you literally cannot make this up.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5545s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5546s)

I firmly believe in my only in my personal opinion that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I believe it's got roots in in very very rich evil stuff I really do and only because it's what I went through right and I mean there's a lot of my story that I haven't even shared that I probably will never share but because of this because of what I went through I believe that we haven't even touched on the evil that is within that church.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5580s)

Yeah I also believe and you can correct me if you think I'm wrong but I believe 80 or 90 percent of the brethren have in there have no idea. I mean like like your parents they have no idea.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5596s)

Yeah well I do believe my parents knew what I went through like from from the oh yeah yeah I don't think they knew I don't think that they knew all of the details but  I  know that my mom knew that I was close to being sold right?

 I mean I have a cousin who witnessed me being picked up and my mom crying that I was going to be sold that day right but there is those people that protect the people right so [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5626s) I look at and I have no issue calling these people out.

 I look at Tim Bond, Arden Bond, Morris Hope I mean even Yvonne Hope I mean she's still alive she can get her, she could stand up I know she's a female but I know she knows stuff we can get into a lot of people in Maple Creek who did the protecting of the people that were sick and when I mean sick I'm talking about these perpetrators because that's they're sick to me to me they're very very [diseased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5656s) people. 

But I do believe they took these diseased people and they got I do believe that they were a part of something very evil and and maybe one day I'll have the guts to to talk about that kind of stuff but it's I think the reason why Bruce Hales has had to gain such control over what he's had to gain control of, is to hide the roots that are about to be exposed and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5687s) in order to to to have he knows that these roots are going to be exposed, I mean he's talked about the Aberdeen that's going to happen in his time.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5694s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5695s)

He's very very smart with what he has done to keep his flock very fixated on just him. That's why he's had to let the bible go, it's why he's had to let everything go because he knows in his time some shit's gonna go down and in order for it to not take everything down with him what has he got to do he's got to get this congregation of 55,000 people to completely be listening eyes forward blinders on [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5725s) to fixate on him.

So that when all of this gets exposed there's only a few that pop off here and there, right, that's what he thinks yeah I think it's going to be a lot more than he thinks.

 No and I mean that's just my only personal opinion I'm going to put that in there that's my personal opinion but I like I firmly I seriously I don't I don't like I really I don't hate Bruce Hales I really don't I hate what he has done I hate what he does with his power.

 I hate what he has created because what he has created is why we have the wars we have on this planet right to me religion, the basis of what religion is today and what people in power like he has is why our planet is the way it is.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5776s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5777s)

I pointed right back the arrow goes strictly on to a piece of paper that says religion and I'm not talking about Christian church mainstream culture I'm talking about religion religion when you take the title of religion like what Bruce Hales does and does what he does to it, warps it, warps the your whole soul it just warps it all and he gains control.

 I've said it before he is a one-headed monster that has 55,000 people inside his body with one head yeah and that's dangerous that is dangerous I mean it is a small community it is a small a small small community but it is a small community that [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5824s) and it is such damage evil evil damage and I do believe it will fall I 100 percent believe it will fall. Yeah it just might not be when I'm here.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5838s)

Hopefully I get to see it because  I 'll be so excited yeah I've got to uh I've got to run here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5846s)

I know we're we're really running behind and going over time and we could sit here and do it over and over but again thank you so much Peter and Carman thank you everybody for diving into all of this and shedding some light on some things that a lot of our viewers were looking for.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCuQ26mIN1o&t=5866s)

Yeah, that was good.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
