## Summary

Dr Alex Stein is a social psychologist who specializes in cults and totalitarian groups. In this podcast, Alex describes her own experience of being involved in a political cult and the difficulties she had in extricating herself from it.
Alex talks us through the emotions experienced when wanting to leave a high control group and describes how support with doing so is vital. She discusses avenues of support and how finding the right type of help is important to aid coping outside when leaving such groups.
Totalitarian groups such as the PBCC use the same coercive tactics to control their members as individuals in controlling relationships. Alex explains how this needs to be stopped through the law if possible. She discusses a report published in 2022 that calls for ways in which to amend to law to protect people from controlling groups in the same way individuals are protected in a close personal relationship.
This podcast is a must listen for anyone inside the PBCC who has doubts about the regime controlling their lives and who might want to break free. Listen to the ‘checklist’ that identifies a cult and decide for yourself if the PBCC ticks those boxes

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=7s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with our friends Anne and Ross, and I have a special guest joining me tonight, Dr. Alex Stein. Alex is a social psychologist who specialises in cults and extremist totalitarian groups, and she's the author of two books, both of which are an interesting read.

The first one is called *Inside Out*, which is a story of her own experience of being in a cult and leaving. The second one [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=37s) entitled *Terror, Love and Brainwashing: Attachment in Cults and Totalitarian Systems*, which is a very interesting book to read in which she describes the mental processes one goes through when you leave a very extremist totalitarian group. So we're hoping to explore that a little bit tonight, Alex, but first, perhaps you could just give us a background about how you got involved in the cult and how you came to leave.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=63s)

Okay, so I always start with my family background, which was, I came from a family that was very, well, very active and interested in sort of social justice issues. My dad was South African, and both my parents were involved somewhat in the anti-apartheid movement, and my mum came from a very left-wing background of a couple of generations. So I grew up in that kind of atmosphere.

And the reason I explain that is [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=93s) the kind of cult I got into was therefore a political cult. I was a fourth-generation atheist, so you know, there was going to be a very hard sell to get me into a religious cult. I just didn't have that in my background or my culture at all. But I did have this kind of drive to try to engage in social justice activity to make the world a better place. And as a young person, I still have that drive, I should say.

Anyway, long story, I did various, not too bad things in community organizing as a young person. I'd done a bit of union organizing, and at that point, I was living in California—that's another long story—and I met, through my friend who was union organizing elsewhere, this really nice guy who was doing union [organizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=155s) with my friend. He was really kind of skilled at organizing, and I was very impressed. I kept saying, "Where did you learn how to do this?" He kind of wouldn't tell me, but I'm a persistent character, and I kept after him.

Eventually, again, a very long story, it turned out he had left this sort of secretive group that was based in Minnesota, in the Midwest, in the middle of the country. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=185s) interestingly, he left because he wanted to come out as gay, but he felt he couldn't do that in the group. Now, I don't think I knew that at the time, but that would have been a little red flag to me because I was always friendly with, you know, the gay community and all kinds of things.

Anyway, but through him, through that connection via a friend and appealing to my interests, that this group [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=215s) doing all the kinds of organizing I was interested in, and particularly organizing working women, which I was particularly interested in, I slowly over a period of a couple of years got involved in this group and then was invited out to go to Minneapolis. I had a kind of, always at the beginning, felt there was something a bit funny and wrong about it. But whenever I would bring up a question, I think we all know how that goes. You know, you get a question, and they find a way to round it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=255s)

The cul-de-sac answer. Yeah, you can't go anywhere with it. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=264s)

And gradually, my whole life got involved in this, including being sort of more or less in a semi-arranged relationship and a rather quick marriage and being told to have children and all this stuff. I'll fast forward 10 years because it's a long story, as all of ours are, I think, aren't they? Yes.

During which, I would say, mostly, first [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=294s) all, I was worked to death. I mean, we had our regular day jobs, and then we would come back. Like, I had various day jobs, but I'd come back from them, you know, five o'clock, try to maybe get a little nap, change my clothes, and go to the group bakery and work the evening shift, a full eight-hour other shift. And then you would do your laundry and your shopping at, well, midnight, 2 a.m. And [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=324s) was like that for years. It changed a bit when we had children, but other people who had children earlier than I did still had that kind of schedule, and the kids were in daycare and nightcare of a very low quality, I might add, that the group provided.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=348s)

Out of interest, with what you know now from your studies of controlling groups, is keeping their members too busy part of that control mechanism? In asking this, I'm thinking of in the Brethren, we know now that a lot of the women have to give up their time voluntarily to work in their schools or in their shops. They have to entertain. I mean, I think Anne would attest to being a woman in the Brethren, you just have no time to even think, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=378s) you're exhausted. Is that part of the subconscious control mechanism, do you think?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=383s)

I think it's conscious. I don't even think it's subconscious. I think it's entirely conscious. And I can tell you how I finally got out. The leader ended up in prison. It turned out he killed someone. Anyway, it's a story. Yes. And he ended up in prison, not for long enough. And also, before he went to prison, he kind of fled the state, so he was less available [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=413s) be a useful leader. So things kind of loosened up for a few years.

Now, that meant we had a bit more free time. Well, that's, if you're a cult leader, don't let that happen. That's really a bad move because people then can do a couple of things: they can think, they can relax, they can possibly find a little time to talk to each other.

And that's what happened to me. I ended up going for walks with a comrade from the group, which we wouldn't have ever been allowed to do when it was full-on. And over the time of us going for walks, we slowly started building up a little bit of trust, like testing each other. "Can I say this about the group, or is she going to turn me in?" You know? And then finally, she kind of said, "I think there's power problems in the group," and I just went, "Yeah."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=473s)

And how did that feel when you realized you had somebody who was perhaps thinking along the same lines as you after all those years?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=482s)

It was incredible. I think I just burst into tears.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=485s)

Yeah.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=486s)

We were at the YMCA. They had a track because this was in Minneapolis, where in the winter it's so cold and icy you can't go for a walk, so you walk around the gym. Okay. And on that track, I remember it so vividly. It was just really, you know, one of those moments you never forget, with all these women in the middle of the studio doing their aerobics, you know, and then me just crying because I could finally allow myself to verbalize everything that I [knew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=516s) in my head was wrong, but I had no place to express it, not even really to myself, until there was someone as a reflection. It was really powerful.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=532s)

I think that is one of the hardest things, not being able to talk to somebody. And you know, for myself, I would say, and anybody that's listening inside the Brethren, do trust us. If you feel like you can talk, because I didn't even trust the ex-Brethren community. And I think it's really good that you're on here, Alex, because probably people in the Brethren would trust you more than they would us.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=569s)

Yeah. And I should say, people can, you know, if anyone does want to talk to me, come to my website and send me a little email. I'd be happy to talk to people and be completely confidential. I'm not trying to get business or anything. I'm just saying if you want an ear, I'm happy to be that, because I know what it's like. I know what it's like to not be able to talk to anyone, because the stakes are really high, aren't they?

If you talk to the wrong person... and that [ended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=601s) up happening towards the end where we were finally getting out, me and this woman and her husband. We all sort of decided to get out together. And before we got out, we wanted to talk to some of the others to kind of tell them what we were thinking and let them have an opportunity. We got through a few people, and then one of the people, who by the way finally got out and is now one of my best friends, she turned us into the leadership. She shopped us.

And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=631s) as soon as she did that, the wall came down, and we couldn't talk to anyone then. That was it. Which is bad enough for us, but if it's a situation where you were born or brought up in it, that means, as you well know, I don't have to say this to you, you can't talk to anybody in your whole family. And that's so, the stakes are really high. So that makes it really hard to share a doubt with someone who's inside unless you're absolutely sure of [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=661s), and they can't share with you because they're having the same feeling.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=665s)

Yeah, and I think you're right. And I think people inside, if they can reach out somewhere where they feel comfortable, it could be good for them. I know for myself, Alex is very approachable. But Alex, you also have, perhaps a good time to mention, you're a trustee of the Family Survival Trust, who do a lot to help ex-members, not just Brethren, but all ex-members that have had to fight their way out of totalitarian groups, whether they were born [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=695s) it or whether they elected to join it for whatever reasons.

And I know you do some very good work supporting them and also providing information on these types of control and educating the authorities and so on. And I would say to any Brethren member, this is a group where it's not a load of what you might be worried about, a bitter ex-Brethren. These are people that have experienced similar control and have had to break free, and the behaviour patterns are the same, aren't they, regardless [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=725s) the group?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=725s)

Absolutely. And it can also be helpful to go on really any website that talks about these kinds of controlling groups or even a controlling relationship, like the coercive control guidelines, and just look at the list of behaviours. That's what happened. So when I got out, I was really lucky because quite soon after, I ran into, in Minnesota, a support group and a little announcement in a newspaper [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=755s) just said, "Combating Cult Mind Control, Free Minds."

And I went, "I wonder if my group was a cult." I'd never thought of it before. I just thought it was like there were power problems. So I called up the number back then, this was all before the internet, and they sent me a little packet of information with definitions and lists of these kinds of behaviors: people are isolated, people are made busy all the time, and people are criticized all the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=785s). And there's fear, and there's one, you know, the leadership knows absolutely everything. And I can't, you know, there's a whole bunch of things.

And I just went down that list and went, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. And, you know, my thought was political. So people didn't think back then, 30-plus years ago, that you would have a political cult. That just wasn't really a thing. Now we know a bit more. And that can be just really helpful to, you know, just take a little cruise around the internet [looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=816s) for some definitions and have a think, "That's what happens here."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=823s)

Unfortunately for Brethren members, their internet access is very restricted. But we've often said on these podcasts, there is no law, no reason in the world, why you can't go to a supermarket and buy yourself a pay-as-you-go phone that gives you free internet access. They'd have to keep it hidden. And just start exploring, start finding out, and be open-minded about it. To try and educate yourself about how these groups work. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=853s)

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=853s)

You know, libraries often have free internet. That's a good point.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=858s)

I was going to say that because actually, like I was saying to you, Jacky and Ross, I was at an expert speaker course, and my topic was "Escaping Fear and Finding Freedom." One of the things I spoke about in how I got that freedom was research, and it was through the library because I couldn't do it any other way. But I went to the library, went on YouTube, and watched videos of, I didn't know if I was in a cult, but I thought I'd watch things like the Amish. And then, you know, I secretly read books of people that had left, strangely. And also, it's like I was saying earlier, I wouldn't look at any documentaries of any Brethren who had left.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=911s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=911s)

But I would look at any others. I wouldn't read a book that had been written by an ex-Brethren because they were so labeled as wrong.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=920s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=922s)

And I would just say, do watch those YouTube videos, do read those books, because research is so important.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=931s)

Definitely. I did the same. I used to go to the library to research what I thought was going on, really, and try and get more information.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=943s)

And that's the thing, because you don't have that information when you're inside. I didn't know this guy had killed somebody. I didn't know he had been in prison. There were all kinds of things I didn't know. I didn't know other people's experience, that some people, there'd been violence towards them, because there wasn't towards me. And I didn't know about the sexual abuse of many of the women because I hadn't personally experienced that.

I found out all that later, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=974s) how some of the children's lives were. I didn't know any of that. Because I think when you're in these kind of groups, you just see your little world because that's how it's structured. But the nice thing about, Jacky, you mentioned the charity that I work with, the Family Survival Trust, because there's a real power, and I'm not saying people have to go to a support group, but I was lucky and I was in one in Minnesota when I first got out.

And [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1004s) do that online now here. And the power of it, which I think Jacky you kind of alluded to, is that you have these people from totally different groups. You know, Christian, Hindu, political, personal growth, yoga, anything you can imagine. And they're not from a group like yours, but everything they're saying, you kind of go, "Oh yeah, they did that to me." "Yeah, we couldn't sleep [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1034s) than six hours in our group," or, "Yeah, I couldn't talk to anyone outside the group," or, "Yeah, I never knew my grandparents because they weren't in the group." Oh, sorry, that was a bit close to home. I wasn't even thinking of you, Anne, but that is an example. Because I've heard that from other people, you know, you kind of start seeing these patterns of control.

Because something about seeing it, like I think it is a bit what I was saying, it's too difficult and complicated to look at your own group sometimes. But if you're hearing from these other groups, it becomes really crystal clear quite quickly what those patterns are. It's really helpful. And you don't have to go to a group. You can read all these marvelous memoirs that people have written about their experiences and some of these TV programs and videos and stuff, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1089s) know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1090s)

Yeah, there's a lot of info out there. When you joined the group, you obviously took the decision to join, and I understand the circumstance which has taken you there. But as you went on and got deeper into the work of the group, what was the impact on your personal life and your extended family and so on at that point?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1110s)

It was very severe. First of all, I was told to get into a relationship with someone in the group. I had a boyfriend, it was a sort of new relationship, so it wasn't that tight a relationship, outside the group. I was told to get rid of him, which I did. I was told to get with someone in the group, which I did. We were quickly told to get married, which, I was a kind of slightly wild [feminist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1141s), marriage was not really in my head. But I kind of did it because somehow the way it was put, this was important for my development. That was always a thing. It's all good for your development, right?

And so that was going on. Then, in our group, we were very secret. It was sort of underground, but that was, in a way, just a control thing because it meant my parents didn't know where I was. They had a post office box [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1171s) they could send me letters. Now, my family is pretty screwed up, to be perfectly honest, but that's not why I joined a cult. That's the sort of problem. But they loved me. They didn't deserve not to know where I was. And for some years, they didn't have a phone number for me.

I mean, it was horrible. I had friends back in San Francisco where I'd lived before, and I just kind of dumped them. And only one of those friends, who's now my friend again since I got out, said, "Why are you moving to Minnesota?" She couldn't understand, and she could smell that there was something wrong. And she sort of tried to warn me, but you know, I was on a mission to save the world.

And also, I couldn't [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1223s) to anyone because I was told this was secret. So it's not like I could say to her, "Well, I'm in this group, and let me explain how the group works," because that was like the biggest rule. That was the thing that you're breaking security if you talk. So the only people I could talk to were in the group, and they were the ones who were going to say, "Yes, this is good for your development," even though many of them were very nice, decent people. They were just as trapped as I became.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1251s)

Well, we often say that about people in the Brethren. Take them out, and they're very nice, decent people, but they're completely tunnel-visioned and completely trapped. You mentioned something else there about the secrecy and the security, which in my not-so-well-schooled thought processes, is a feature of a totalitarian group.

The Brethren are very paranoid about security, aren't they? I mean, we know the leader travels with bodyguards and won't be photographed. The usual thing that perhaps somebody clearer-minded would associate with a cult. Is, again, that a feature?

Another example I'll use from the Brethren: they're very paranoid about what has been said in their meetings getting out, and yet their meetings are held in a place of public religious worship. So it's sort of a bit of a paradox, but there you go. But they are very paranoid, and we've heard that if an outsider does attend the meeting and is allowed to, the narrative is changed [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1316s) that what is normally said doesn't get out. Is, again, that a classic feature that is common to cults?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1323s)

Yes. So the way I would describe that, well, first of all, the secrecy is another way of isolating you, right? So you can't talk frankly with someone outside the group. And I know the Brethren have a lot of very clever ways of isolating people. I mean, I'm always impressed by the whole food and drink thing. It's just, you know...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1345s)

Quite unique, I think.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1347s)

Well, the Brahma Kumaris, actually...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1350s)

Really? Okay.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1351s)

A woman-led Hindu cult. You can only eat food that's been prepared by the special person. So that means, you know, you can take food with you for like a day, but that just totally restricts you, right?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1370s)

Yeah, it has the same net outcome as the Brethren "thou shalt not eat with somebody not in your church."

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1377s)

But anyway, the secrecy. So what you see in cults in terms of the belief systems is there are two different kinds, which I call the ideology, which kind of reflects the structure. So in a cult, it's like layers of an onion. In the middle, you have a leader, and then you have the really tight people around the leader. And then you have maybe sort of another layer of lieutenants who sort of run things.

And then depending on how big the cult is, is kind of how many layers you might have. Then you have kind of your common-or-garden members who are full members. Then you might have on the outside, and I don't know what you, well, you can tell me what the Exclusive Brethren have, what I call front groups. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1431s) like, we ran a bakery that had regular people working in it as well as cult members, and regular people got sold our bread. So that's the bit that faces out to the public, so to speak.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1447s)

I suppose that would be the Rapid Relief Team, wouldn't it, Anne?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1450s)

Exactly.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1455s)

I suppose also Brethren businesses as well, because when you're in there, you have to work for Brethren, but obviously they're selling to the general public.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1464s)

Right. So my heroine is this thinker, a German Jewish woman who is no longer with us, Hannah Arendt. And she talked about those front groups as transmission belts between the inside world and the outside world. And they bring resources in: money, maybe new recruits. I know you don't do much in the way of recruits, but a lot of cults do. And what goes out is kind of propaganda that it's like the nice version of what they do. So that's the nice bit that you just described, Jacky, that they tell an outsider. It's the kind of sanitized version.

So you always have those kind of two narratives: the propaganda that goes out to the public, and then inside you've got a different form which she calls indoctrination, which is the crazy stuff, like, "You shall not share your... you can't have a house that is attached to anyone else's," because, I don't know what the "because" is, but you know what it is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1544s)

Yeah, you're right. The rules that are crazy on the face of it but are accepted as, "That's the way it is."

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1553s)

But you're not going to tell someone outside that because they're going to think you're crazy.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1559s)

Yeah, I mean, it's not only houses, it was you couldn't have your drains attached either.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1563s)

Yeah, you don't want your drainage to mix, do you? Well, that seemed to be what it was all about. And you know, Scientology's got, I always use Scientology as an example of that. So, you know, if you go by their stupid places that they have, and they say, "Fill out, you know, come in and fill out this personality quiz." And then they tell you that, you know, a lot of people like personality quizzes, right? They're kind of fun to do.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1593s) they'll tell you, "Well, you're depressed," or, "You're anxious," or whatever they tell you, but whatever is the cure is Scientology, obviously. But that's what you get on the outside. What you don't get till you're quite far inside those circles is the crazy stuff, which is that, you know, there was this volcano that shot out alien somethings and they've inhabited your body and you have to do all this Scientology stuff to get them out of your body. You can't tell that to someone on the pavement [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1623s) Goodge Street because they're going to run in the other direction. You have to warm people up to that over a period of time. So that's that two different kinds of belief system are portrayed, so to speak.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1642s)

Yeah, it's interesting because in the instance of the Brethren, as you rightly say, they rarely recruit. So we were all brought up with those crazy ideas as our normal, which was quite difficult to then undo because you'd not known anything different. And I think that's part of the problem people face when they leave, is just trying to undo what has been their normal for X number of years.

And it's interesting, the front, and I will just quote [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1672s) because I think it's appropriate to do so. There's an article gone out recently done by Lindy Jacomb on the Mail Online, and obviously the Brethren are always given a right to reply. And often their right to reply is the same standard sentences. I've done articles, and the reply has been the same, isn't it? You know, in my case, it's always, "I left many years ago and things have changed and they don't know what's going on."

But in this particular article, one of their rebuttals was the [PBCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1703s), which of course they call themselves the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church now, deny that former members were banned from seeing family once they'd left, saying, quote, "The church would never stand in the way of families communicating with each other." And I feel half inclined to say to everybody outside, "Send that to your family in and say, 'Hey, look, you can talk to us,'" and see what happens. But that's what I mean about the fuzzy outside. And yet [most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1733s) of us as ex-Brethren would just feel like saying that's just simply not true. I mean, Anne and Ross, you've got more recent experiences than I have. But that's what they say in rebuttals.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1745s)

Yeah. Well, I try not to let that make me angry. But when I read that one today, I'm afraid I did feel some anger, you know, because there's this one thing, you know, families breaking up for personal reasons. Sometimes it would almost be easier if it was that reason for me. But every time I see a message like that, I go back to my youngest son and the messages that were filtered to me. So you're more recently for, and his words were, "I love her and I know she loves me." It was just torn. "I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1789s) want to leave her, but she was against Mr. Hales." If you're saying that the church isn't stopping contact with my son, what is that?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1808s)

And I want to, you know, all cults do that. I think that was something when I was doing my research that really came through. It's not just some cults that cut off and destroy people's families. It's all cults. And they do it because if they don't do it, people can find a way out. Because we have strong feelings about our family. We love, like he said, you know, we love the people in our family. And so it's a very strong pull.

And that's why that word "attachment" is in the title of my book that Jacky mentioned. They systematically break down people's strong, loving attachments with other people, whether you're in the cult, where they do it as well in a different way, or whether it's with people outside [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1862s) cult. And it's just a total pattern in cults because if they didn't do that, in a way, you couldn't have a cult, because people would put their families and their loved ones first. But in a cult, you can't do that. You have to put the leadership first.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1879s)

And I found it comes with conditions as well. Like, I have spoken to my mum a few times. The last conversation I had, I needed help practically before I left. She said one of the last things she said to me was, "If you're ever in dire straits, ring us." So I did. And the answer was, "Well, if you come back, there'll be help." And you know, there's no help unless I go back.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1909s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1910s)

So there's always a condition attached to what they say. What they say and what they do are two different things.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1919s)

And that's why I stayed in my group so long, because I got married off quickly. And that's why they marry people off quickly. And, you know, we cared about each other, my husband and I. We had feelings for each other. And so to leave, even though I wanted to leave after a year, and actually I did leave after a year for a few months, well, of course, he wasn't allowed to speak to me. And I missed him, and I didn't really know anyone who wasn't in the cult in Minnesota. And I didn't understand it was a cult. My head was just spinning around. I just didn't know what was what. And I went back. And then he was allowed to see me, and he came and met me with a bunch of flowers.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1960s)

It's exactly the same tactics, isn't it?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=1965s)

For another nine years. And just one other thing about my husband, my now ex-husband. When I left, I tried to talk to him and say, "You know," like, I was trying to help him get out too, because I still cared about him. And I can't quite remember if it was an email or if he said it to me, anyway, but he refused to come out. And then I wanted to nonetheless keep the marriage going because I thought, "Well, I still care about him, and maybe it'll work itself out." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2004s) he said no, because, "You've betrayed the very basis of our relationship," which I think, again, you all can relate to that kind of thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2015s)

Yeah. I imagine drawing parallels with perhaps what the Brethren might say about that. The same tactic is when you get a husband and a wife and one partner wants to leave, and whichever one is staying is saying, "I would rather stay in Mr. Hales's fellowship than come out with you," which is what happens, isn't it? Which is a similar thing. It's betrayal of the thought process of the cult, and it might be the ideology, I suppose, or it might be the [person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2049s), the leader, depending on...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2051s)

Yeah, well, I remember when I was getting married, what we were told was we had to be married to the assembly before we could get married.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2061s)

And that's what Jehovah's Witnesses do as well. They say there's, I can't remember the wording, but it's something like, "It's a braid of three in this marriage," you know, life and Jehovah or whatever. And it's true, I think they say that. And the same thing, there was a really good scholar of cults called Margaret Singer, and she talked a lot about parents and children in cults. And [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2091s) said, "There's a third party in the relationship between parents and children in a cult." And that's a nice, simple way of putting what it is. The parent isn't just dealing with the child as they want. They're always having to consider, you know, what's the correct way.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2114s)

And the approved way. Sorry, Anne, go on.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2117s)

I was just going to say, like for example, my youngest, he had to choose the leader over me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2125s)

Yeah, he had to make that choice. So, thinking about my days of being in the Brethren, which are a long time ago, obviously Anne's and Ross's are far more recent, but thinking about that, what it might do to a person mentally, in their mental well-being. So if you're in this kind of totalitarian group and there's a bit of you that's thinking, "Well, that doesn't quite add up," or, "That doesn't seem quite right," or, "That's not sitting quite comfortably," but then obviously, [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2155s) order to survive, and I think a lot of Brethren members do this, you have to quash that thought. Are you able to sort of touch on what that could do to somebody's mental well-being if you're doing that on an ongoing basis?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2171s)

Well, just trying to think back also to my own experience. I mean, I definitely quashed it. I had a lot of doubts, and I think the way I experienced it was just pushing them to the back of the brain. It's like they're there, but you're not going to let them come into your consciousness. And so, and all cults, again, somehow teach you not to think about your own experience with your own mind. It's like, "Let me tell you what your experience is because you're not clever enough or devout enough," or whatever it is.

So about your daily experience in the group, you lose your ability to think about what's [happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2225s) and your perception. And what you're getting instead is just lies. You're getting this fiction telling you what's happening.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2235s)

Yeah, I mean, that just comes to mind. The... BDH, that's the man at the top, his mantra is, "We'll do the thinking, you do the doing."

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2248s)

Exactly. That sums it up. So you're really conditioned, mostly by fear, I would say, not to stop and think, "Actually, this is what's happening in my life," and, "Actually, I'm not really happy here," and, "Actually, I think maybe there's some abuse going on," etc., etc. You know, you actually use your critical thinking. You might be able to critically think about, say, your day job, if you have a job outside the group, though not everyone does.

So [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2283s) may be areas where you can think critically, but you can't think critically about anything to do with the group because you've been told you can't. You've been told not to. And also, if you do think about it, you're going to have doubts, but you know you shouldn't have doubts. And so that's frightening to have doubts. So it's frightening to even think about the doubts, if you see what I mean. You push it away. Because you're sort of separating your thinking from your feelings. So they can tell you what you're feeling and thinking. We call that dissociation in the world of psychology. So you're a little bit like a rabbit in the headlights, like, "I'll just put one foot in front of the other every day and not think too hard about it because I can't think, because it's too frightening to think." It's a bit hard to explain, but I'm doing my best.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2343s)

I think we can all empathize, actually. I think anybody who's left such a group can empathize with that. I mean, as I say, it was a long time ago, but I certainly had two years when I felt exactly like that. That sort of, "Hang on a minute," or, "Don't even think like that, because you're not right. It's because you're not committed enough. It's you that's at fault, not..."

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2363s)

And maybe you're going to go to hell, or you'll be punished in some way, or you'll become a drug addict or a prostitute. They'll also tell you, if you leave, there are very clear messages of what's going to happen if you leave. These are fearsome messages.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2381s)

Very fearful messages. I know of somebody that was told within a couple of years they would end up destitute and come groveling back. And that's the language that's used, which of course is going to make you fearful. You don't know, if you've never been outside the world, you don't know what the world holds out there. It's hugely scary. So when you left, Alex, the political cult you were in, how did that affect, I mean, how did you readjust? Because it'd be slightly different in that you had had [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2415s), 20 years or sort of a relatively outsider life?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2419s)

I had a, I grew up in a previous life. That's a good way to put it. But just tagging on to what we were just saying, I always think people who leave cults are very, very, very brave. Because to leave, you have to kind of, the way I envisage it, you have to walk through this wall of fear. And you've got this fear we just talked about, which is just sort of often nameless. You don't even know what it is. You just know that you feel frightened.

And then you've got the fear of, "Are they going to come after me?" Which, I thought this guy was going to come and kill me. I mean, he wasn't, but that's how I felt. The fear of how are you going to survive on the outside world. So you've got a lot of fear that you have to have a kind of leap, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2471s) hate to use this expression, but a leap of faith. I always say it's like walking off the edge of the known world into this...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2482s)

And hoping there's a mattress at the bottom.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2485s)

Exactly, hoping you're going to land somewhere. And like you said, Jacky, that was me who had a whole life beforehand, and had the same feelings. So we're all very, very brave to start with. And when I got out, again, I think I was lucky because I got out with two other people, so we kind of supported each other in a slightly dysfunctional way. We were a bit together.

And then later that year, other [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2515s) came out, and we really did talk a lot. We would have slightly drunken evenings where we would just all tell these stories about what had happened that we didn't, like I said in the beginning, we didn't know each other's experience. And all the stuff came tumbling out, and that was kind of fun. And I felt a lot of joy coming out because, like [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2545s) like the cover of my first book, it was like going from this gray world into the world of color.

So even though it was the most frightening thing I've ever done, coming out, and it was really difficult in all kinds of ways, and also I had periods of depression and a lot of anxiety and grief and anger, there was also a lot of beauty and joy. I remember the spring I came out, in spring, and spring in Minneapolis is really beautiful. You've got all the lilac, and I just was like, "I've lived here for like 10 years, and I never noticed the lilac."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2582s)

Wow. Yeah, because you were too absorbed. You actually had a minute to stop and enjoy it for the first time in 10 years.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2594s)

Yeah. So it was a lot of intense, intense emotion of all kinds. They've got a word for it, which is sometimes you get a bit flooded with emotion. I don't know if that was any of your experience when you came out. Because in the group, in a way, you kind of don't have your own emotions in a funny way, so it's quite powerful to have them again.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2623s)

Yeah, I mean, I think that's right. I remember my overriding emotion when I came out, apart from all the fear, but I was fortunate enough to work in a non-Brethren workplace. We could do so back then, they can't now, but I could. And I worked with girls my own age, and my overriding emotion was how kind these girls were when they realised what was happening. Because I'd been told there weren't kind people there, there's only [kindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2653s) in the Brethren.

And yet, just in those few short weeks after I left and I eventually told them what was happening, the way they just accepted it and said, "Anything we could do to help," including taking me to a nightclub, I have to add. But they looked after me. It was that overwhelming kindness and their response. I don't know what Anne and Ross experienced, but that's the emotion I remember. It's that actually, people outside were very kind.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2678s)

Yeah, I would say the same, really. When I was leaving, I'd actually been kicked out of the Brethren. I was going down to meetings in London, and I was sharing what was going on. And a bloke came up to me after one of the meetings and said, "Look, I've got a room you can have free of charge for as long as you need it until you get back on your feet." And I was just so overwhelmed because you were taught in there that nobody [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2708s) here is kind, they always want something in return. And I realized, like Jacky said, there are kind people out there, and they actually don't want anything in return. Whereas in the Brethren, it's like I said earlier, they'll do things for you, but there's always a caveat to it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2729s)

Yeah, absolutely. I still get blown away by the kindness shown to me just when I talk to people. I write my story, or just in life, and I'll say, like Ross says, it's the unconditional love that people show you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2750s)

The humanitarian love, just that's it. They just look out for you because you're a fellow human being.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2755s)

Right. And that's what's so weird about relationships inside cults, is that conditionality. They'll do instrumental things to help you, right? You know, if you can't get to the meeting, they'll give you a ride.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2774s)

Yeah, totally.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2777s)

But not, just like in my group, you couldn't just talk to someone about, "Oh, I'm not feeling good today," and be listened to kindly like my friends do now. It would be like, "You know, that's unproductive." They called it "exchange value" in my group.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2809s)

You're there with, you're giving to the purpose. The tactics are exactly the same, aren't they? As you're speaking, it's quite interesting because you're speaking about a very different group with a very different agenda, but as you're speaking, I'm laughing because I'm just thinking, "Same tactics." The group has its own speak, almost, doesn't it? We call it "peeb speak," short for Plymouth Brethren speak, and there are certain phrases and terms.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2839s)

We call it loaded language.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2841s)

Loaded language.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2843s)

That's another isolating thing. So, one of the main things, there are three kind of main strategies that cults use. They isolate you. They do that in three ways: from the outside world, from people in the cult, like we just talked about, because you can't share doubts, and also from your own internal discussion with yourself, because, what we also talked about, you push that aside.

Then they kind of engulf you [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2874s) the group. So everything in your life is in the group. You're engulfed in the group. You don't have a tennis club and a political party or this or that. It's all group, all the time. And then there are all these fear messages. And that's really the little tricky formula of how to have a cult. And I think all cults do versions of that. And so you get the same underlying dynamics no matter what, whether it's in a religious framework or [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2904s) political one or whatever kind of framework.

So, I was lucky to have some other people. That was a big struggle because my husband didn't get out, and he was told by the leader to try to gain full custody of our two children.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2932s)

I was going to ask if you had children at that stage.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2934s)

Yes, we were told to have children. We adopted two beautiful, lovely children who are now creating loads of grandchildren for me. And so, he wasn't the kind of person who would do that of himself, try and get full custody, because we'd always shared everything 50-50. He was... they were very sharing. Anyway, and I had to kind of basically threaten the cult leader to have that stop. I always dissociate when I'm telling that story because that was so heavy and stressful.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2976s)

I can imagine, yes.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=2978s)

So the first part of getting out was dealing with all these practical, well, they're not just practical, they're emotional things of children, and then where I was going to live, and what happened with the marriage. And we had a business together that we did really sort of for the cult. It wasn't exactly a cult business, but it was me and my husband ran it. So then we had to pull that apart because he was staying in.

So everything, again, I'm sure I'm telling you what happened, you kind of know anyway, but it's that [pulling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3008s) apart of all the fabric of your life, which is extremely difficult. But on the other hand, like I say, I had freedom. And I was starting, I found old friends, and I connected back with my sister, who I adore, in a proper way. So I don't want to say it's easy, because it's not easy. It's difficult.

But then, [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3038s) you've kind of done that, then you have all these emotions, like all the lost years. And then, "How do I know what's true and what's not true?" And you have to rebuild a belief system and untangle what I call the fiction of the belief system in the group. And you have to kind of think, at least I do, and also I encourage other people to go back over their experience and think about it again [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3068s) their own mind, as opposed to what they were told their experience was.

So good cult recovery therapy, which is hard to find, can be a way to help do that. But you can also do that just by talking to other people who understand. So there's that phase. And then you have, then you're reconnecting with life, and you're discovering, in a way, who you are. You try different things and you discover, "Well, I like life drawing, and I [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3098s) writing, but I don't like belly dancing," or whatever you try. There's this kind of whole phase of, I think, exploration, if you have the ability and the resources to do that. Because that's the tricky thing. I truly believe people getting out of cults should have access to refuges, like people getting out of domestic abuse.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3129s)

We've sometimes noticed with people that leave the Brethren, they've obviously had everything denied to them all their life. And one of the narratives that's told within the Brethren is, "If you leave, you'll go off the rails." And it's sadly true that you could say some people, they don't go off the rails, but suddenly they've got the whole choice of what to do with life, and they've had no boundaries set all their life.

So I [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3159s) say to somebody that leaves, if you hear somebody that's gone off the rails doing something "wicked," actually they are just doing exactly what you said, Alex, exploring what they like and don't like in life. And what you hope is they don't get into serious trouble with doing that, that there is a sort of comfort zone that can just push them a little bit while they start to build those boundaries. It's a bit like being a teenager.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3187s)

Yes, it is. And I know the first year I got out, I mean, I started smoking again. I hate smoking, I know it's bad. It's like, "Damn it, I can smoke, so I'm going to." It didn't last long because I always get bronchitis when I smoke. But yeah, I think you are testing boundaries like a teenager does. And hopefully you have enough support. [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3217s). But I think that is a natural part of getting out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3221s)

It's part of a process, almost, isn't it, to redefine where you're at with life?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3226s)

Yeah, I mean, I remember when I first left, at 44, you would think I would have had a bit of worldly sense, but I didn't have any because I had no boundaries. And I could have gotten into some really sticky situations. I was lucky, I got into a relationship with a guy who was very kind to me at that time. But it is, it is being like a teenager. I sort of talk about myself, "I'm only 10, I've only been in the world 10 years."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3259s)

You've yet to do your teenage years.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3266s)

I also want to emphasize that so many of the people I work with, they do go through this hard transition, but then so many of them go on to have such wonderful lives and make great contributions and are wonderful people and have great kids. It's a journey. It's just there are some bumps to get there. Not everyone does make it, that is also true, but I think a lot of people do really well if they are able to find some support, whether it's online or by reading books or whatever it is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3307s)

And I think different types of support work for different people. And as you mentioned earlier, it's, as I understand it, very hard to find therapy that really understands the nature of how a cult controls your mind and then the unpicking of that. That's actually very hard to do. But sometimes I think just talking about it to people that have been there can help you work it through. So support groups like that, they don't have to be ex-Brethren, it can be people that have had to go, like yourself, Alex, through a similar experience for very different reasons, that can just help unpick it in your head, can't it?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3346s)

And people who have been through it or who've been through similar kinds of trauma, maybe not like, you know, someone who's maybe been in a domestically controlling relationship, or a refugee. When you speak to people like that, you get the non-judgmental listening. What you don't want is the people who look at you weird and go, "Oh, wow, that's weird."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3379s)

Yeah, you desperately need to be accepted just the way you are, don't you? I think that's the key, isn't it? You, with all the weird backgrounds and what have you, you desperately need to just be accepted with no judgment or reaction. And that's sometimes hard to find, isn't it?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3397s)

But what we're discovering in our work and also through the media is how common an experience this is. When you come out, you think that you're the only one, but boy, there are hundreds of us all over the world.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3415s)

And you mentioned something else there, which I also wanted to touch on, because I know Cheryl's mentioned this in the podcast, but about coercive control and the nature of that, and how obviously here in the UK, it's now a criminal offence if proven. And I know the Family Survival Trust has done some work around trying to expand that law. I'd be interested if you could sort of tell us about that.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3442s)

Well, yeah. So there's this law, which I think is a very progressive law that's fairly new, which says if a person does all these things that we've been talking about—isolates you, makes you fearful, controls all the small parts of your life, and they do it for their own benefit to exploit you—that's a criminal offense, but only if that person is in an intimate or family relationship with you.

So if I had someone in my house who I was involved with do that to me, they could potentially be in prison if they were convicted. But if my neighbor did it to me, there's no law that [covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3491s) that. They could just get away with it. Or if my workplace does it to me, or if my church does it to me. So we think this is crazy and just illogical.

So we've written up just an amendment to the law where we take out that phrase. And we also did a big research report showing how all the elements in the guidelines that exist for that law also apply to people in cults. And if people are interested, they can find that on our [website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3522s), which is...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3522s)

We can put a link on this podcast if you're happy with that. We'll make sure it goes on so people can find it easily.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3529s)

They can see the report, and they can see the law, and they can see our website, which also has a support group. And we would like to campaign in a more systematic way, but we're very under-resourced. But we are talking about it a lot. It has made it into a few newspapers and the BBC, I think. So we're just trying to get people talking about this as a first step. Like, "This doesn't make sense."

It's absolutely illogical that this only applies within the four walls of someone's house. And we're hoping to slowly generate some momentum around it and have people, what we'd like to see is people going to their MPs in their constituency and say, "This was my experience, we need a law, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3580s) is the law we think needs to get changed. Do something about it." And write letters to the editor, write opinion pieces. But I feel we need to start just making some noise as a group, because I think that's how you get understanding. People first have to understand this is a problem, because a lot of, certainly politicians, don't really quite yet recognize this as a problem. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3610s) we have to educate them, is my view.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3613s)

Yeah, I agree. And I think if I've understood it correctly, it's that obviously the law says "in a close personal relationship," whatever the wording is, but the thinking is that a group can control, right? And if a group is doing that, so in other words, a group, i.e., a political cult or a church, if it were law, could be prosecuted for taking away somebody's liberties by coercive control. Is that sort of it, if I [understood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3643s) that?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3643s)

Yes. And you have a lot of issues about who you're prosecuting because we don't have good laws in this country about prosecuting organizations, whereas in America they do a little bit better with that. That's partly what Trump's going through right now because they have a good law on that. Because we don't want to prosecute my ex-husband or whoever, it's the leadership. They're the ones responsible, they're the ones who have all the power, and they're the ones who [should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3674s) be held accountable.

So, there are some complexities here, but other countries, there are a few other countries that do have good laws. France has a law that says you may not psychologically manipulate somebody for your own benefit and subjugate another person against their own interests. And also, both the English and the French law, I think, both say the person being oppressed in the system [may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3704s) not be able to acknowledge that they're a victim. It's really important for us because, of course, all that indoctrination makes you unable to say, "Yeah, I don't want to be here."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3724s)

I hadn't thought of it that way. It's kind of, we know that in these circumstances it'll either be a leader or it'll be a group that kind of coerces the people, but who would you actually take to court? So yeah, there are things to be discussed, but it's certainly a principle. As you say, the behavior patterns are identical to coercive control between two partners who live together or a parent and an [adult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3754s) child, for example.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3758s)

And I think it is the leadership. First off, I think you have to dismantle the organization, because it's very hard to reform these organizations because their whole basis is built on this. And then, you know, you guys know, so when the leadership changes, things change. And it's the leader who's defining things. So I think you do have to go after them. But it is tricky. And then how far down do you go from the lieutenants? And this goes back to the prosecution of the Nazis after the war. How far down the line were people responsible? They're difficult questions, but really important ones.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3808s)

Well, really important to try and prevent it from happening, if we ever could. I don't know, but maybe I'm just an optimist.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3819s)

I just wanted to go back a little way, going back to the characteristics of the cult. There's something that's been on my mind. Is one of the characteristics that if you're dissenting and you're thinking critically about the cult, is it a characteristic that they'll use medication to basically make you docile? Because we've heard of instances in the Brethren where there have been people dissenting and they've been critical [thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3849s), and they've been told, "Oh, you've got a mental problem, and we'll give you antidepressants to help that." I just wondered if that's something that's a common characteristic.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3862s)

I'm sure there are other cults that do that. I think what's common is, and cults are creative, they do all the same things, but each cult has its own ways of doing those things. So all cults want to suppress dissent. So, some may do it with medication, others may do it by, well, "shutting up" is another one. We had a version of that, you know, you isolate someone within the group.

So the medication, I think I might have heard about that in one or two other groups, they're not springing to mind, so I don't think [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3910s) the medication that's so universal, but it's just one creative way of shutting people up. But I think the mental illness thing is used. Like, "You must be crazy if you think we're crazy," kind of thing. "What's wrong with you?"

And that's, do you know the expression DARVO? Which is in the domestic arena. It's what [Trump's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3940s) doing right now. It's what an abuser will say when they're accused. They'll Deny, so DARVO is D-A-R-V-O, it's an acronym.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3950s)

Yes, go on.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3952s)

They'll Attack the person who's criticizing them. They'll Reverse Victim and Offender. So they'll make themselves the victim and say that the person criticizing is the oppressor. And you can see that pattern. Trump was doing that today in his court case. "Poor, poor me, leader of the group. I'm the poor little victim who's being tormented."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=3983s)

And that can really play with your sense of reality if you're on the receiving end of that, can't it? And I think that's part of the problem. In the Brethren terms, it would be, you know, they deny, "We're a lovely community," and they attack, "It's those wicked opposers," and then it's, "Us poor victims, we're the religious minority being persecuted." And it's exactly that, isn't it? And then if somebody inside is dissenting, the similar [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4013s) happens. But I believe what that person will get told is, "You know, it's you that's wrong. It's not us, it couldn't possibly be the group. It's you. You're not right with the Lord."

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4026s)

When I was questioning in the group, because at the beginning I questioned a lot before I learned not to, I'd be told, "You're not developed enough yet to understand, so just struggle with the practice." Yes, but shut up and work hard. That's gaslighting. What you just described, Jacky, that's right, it's all gaslighting. Of course, these groups are brilliant at it. That's the entire belief system, in a way, is one big gaslighting. "We're perfect, and we're all going to heaven, and the rest of the world is terrible, and we've got it right." It's a lie. I'm not talking about religious things.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4084s)

I just wanted to highlight it, really, because there are people in there that are being told that, just to know that it isn't actually true.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4093s)

It's a terrible thing to do to people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4095s)

Yeah, it takes away their liberties. And I think the thing is, if you have your physical liberties taken away, that is very easy to prove, isn't it? If somebody is physically locked up, that's very easy to prove. But when you have your psychological liberties taken away, your freedom of thought, which is in the Human Rights Act, and that's taken away from you, the sad thing is people don't always realise it until they start to think clearly or they step aside. But that's not easy.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4128s)

I talk about that. What cults do, when I was talking before about the dissociation and that you can't think about what your own experience is, they're disabling your critical thinking. And that's deliberate. That's not by accident. That's a deliberate set of all the things we've talked about—the isolation, the fear, and all those things—is to disable your ability to think. So they're doing that on purpose. That is a wicked thing to do to people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4158s)

Yeah, in whatever context, religious, political, any context. And the other factor I think about cults, one of the characteristics I read sometimes is that these groups make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to leave. And one of the main things, if you were thinking of joining a group, or indeed if you were brought into a group, if you said, "Is it easy for me to walk away? Do I have freedom to walk away?" and if you haven't got that, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4188s) think there is a question. Is that a fair comment to make?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4193s)

Yeah, it's what I call the difference between a closed network, or what Janja Lalich calls a self-sealing system, which is just tight and closed, versus a kind of open network where it's not so open you don't know anyone. You have your friends, family, and then you have some acquaintances, and then you have maybe work colleagues. But it's sort of open, there's some flexibility, not everyone belongs to the same claustrophobic little [bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4223s). There are overlaps with other things.

And that openness means you can change things. You can say, "Well, I don't get on with this group anymore." This happened to me recently. I joined the Labour Party a few years ago, and then I resigned from the Labour Party because I didn't like things. Now, again, I don't know what anyone's political opinions are, this is just me. And when I left the Labour Party, no one came running [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4254s) me. I didn't lose all my friends and family. I still will say hello to the nice guy who still is in the Labour Party on my block. I met a few new people, I didn't lose friends when I got in, I didn't lose friends when I got out. Even though I had disagreements with them, that was okay. I might even rejoin it at some time if they change.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4285s)

On the religious side, the Brethren claim to be like a mainstream Christian church. But I think that's the one fundamental difference. You could live in a very close-knit community. Let's use an example. You could go to a Methodist church where you feel very close to the people you go to church with. But you work outside the church. You have other people on the fringes. Your family may not go to that church. That doesn't matter. And then you may move to a different part of the country and you might [join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4315s) a Church of England church. And that doesn't matter because you're keeping whatever faith or, in your case, political affiliation you want, but you're choosing how you practice that. And when you take away that choice of practice, that's when it becomes dangerous, damaging.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4333s)

When you leave the Methodist church when you move, they're not all going to never speak to you again. When you come back there, you may have tea with them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4341s)

And cake. Yeah, and that's, I think, the fundamental difference between, as you say, a closed group. And I would just want to say to the Brethren, if you are listening to this podcast, try and recognize which group you're in. Is it that open group that you could walk away from and go back and feel free in your mind, or is it what you called it, Alex, the self-sealing... I like that. It's a nice expression, that self-sealing [bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4372s) that you cannot break out of? And I think that'd be a good question to ask.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4377s)

Yeah, I agree. A healthy group doesn't shun people. You might even be cross for a while. I don't know what the Labour Party thinks of me, they probably didn't even notice I was gone, frankly. But it's like, it's a political disagreement, that's the beginning and end of it. And people in the party might also be friends with people in the Lib Dems. I'm friends with people who are Greens. I don't want to personally vote Green. I'm friends with other, you know, it's like you're allowed to have all these crossovers, and that's healthy. It's like if you think of a compost pile, if you only have one thing in the compost pile, it's not very nutritious. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4424s) have to have a variety of ingredients for it to be nice and healthy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4429s)

And grow. Yeah, that's a good analogy.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4431s)

Humus, so yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4434s)

That's interesting. And one other thing I wanted to touch on just before we close, Alex. In your book, you mentioned, I think it was attachment levels, and the difficulty of, I think you mentioned it earlier in the podcast. Can you talk a little bit around that and what they mean and how they form?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4453s)

So, there was a wonderful scholar called John Bowlby, and he came up with this idea, and other people have taken it forward, and it's very basic now in psychology thinking. So the first idea is that the same way we have needs for, we have basic human needs, we need food, we need shelter, to reproduce we have to have sex, they're these fundamental elements. And one of them, he said, is we need to have attachment to others for the purpose of protection.

And that, on an evolutionary basis, is if the parent and child [weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4500s) attached, in other words, they had a strong bond and wanted to stay together, if they just were kind of, and the baby was left behind, the baby would get chewed up by the lions. And it's not good for the evolution, the survival of the species. So when people have these strong bonds, that protects us from dangerous things.

So in childhood, we have that [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4530s) parents, although cults try to break that, by the way, as I said. But the kind of healthiest sort of form of attachment is called secure attachment. Is this what you wanted me to do?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4544s)

Yes, I read about it in your book.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4547s)

It's really interesting. It really is. And it could be between a parent and a child, or it could be, say, between partners, or even your very best friend. It's those very strongest relationships. So to try to understand it, let's say the parent and child, because that's the easy way to think about it. The parent's job is to protect the child. The child's job is to stay close or to know that the parent's going to protect them.

So when the child is, let's say, a toddler playing in the playground, they're in their exploratory mode, out playing, happy. They can look and see that mommy or daddy's there, but they're basically out playing. But then they fall down, they hurt their knee. So they're experiencing stress or fear, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4603s) some bully comes up to them, or a dog comes and barks. There's some stress, and they go running to their parent, right, knowing that the parent's there to protect them. The parent looks after them and says, "It's all right," for a few minutes, and then eventually the kid goes, "All right, enough, Mom, I want to go back and play."

So that's like this rubber band effect of exploring, but when stressed, go back for some comfort, and then go and explore again. And that's happening in the body with chemicals. So the exploring is all about cortisols and the kind of energy and excitement hormones. And [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4643s) fear ones, when the dog comes and barks, the cortisols go up. Back to mom or dad, the cuddling and the comfort of a good relationship brings up what's called your endorphins, your internal opioids, which bring down your cortisols and make you feel safe. And when you've had a certain amount of safety, it's like, "That's good enough. I want to go out, have some excitement again." So that's the kind of healthy dynamic.

There are two others that are good enough. They're not perfect, but they're good enough. One is when you have the protector, that parent, is available to you, but in a sensitive way. If you have a parent who's pretty into their own problems, they've got a lot of problems they're dealing with, they're going to be unreliable. But [sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4708s) when you go to them, they're going to look after you, and sometimes they're too busy thinking about their own problems. So that means you get a kid often who's a bit clingy because they want to be there when that availability is there, when mum or dad has the capacity to look after them. So that's one version called, the first one was called secure attachment, that one's called preoccupied.

The third one is called dismissing, and that's when the parent has been reliably neglectful or rejecting. So you know there's no point going to mom or dad because they just are not there for you. So that makes a child, or a grown-up, you know, it's just using the child as an illustration, they're [overly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4756s) self-reliant. "I'm not going to go to mom and dad, they're not going to be comforting, so I'm just going to take care of myself." So those last two aren't the best, but they're good enough because they're predictable. You know that this one's going to be a bit unreliable. You know that that one isn't ever going to be there for you. So you can kind of manage yourself.

But the tricky one is the one that happens in cults, number four, and that's called disorganized attachment. And that happens when the parent, or the supposed comforter, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4795s) the source of the stress. So instead of the barking dog, you've got the frightening parent. In between that relationship, you have the fear. And that is massively confusing because what happens is, the parent, you're evolved, your body is evolved to go to the parent when you're frightened. But when the parent frightens you, you go towards them for comfort, but they're shouting at you or they're [frightening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4825s) you. So you're also trying to avoid them.

So you're trapped in trying to go and trying to get away, this kind of approach-avoid. And you get these pictures, they've done studies where they show you these little toddlers in those kind of relationships, they do all this weird stuff. Like when they approach their parent, they go towards and then they back up, or they sort of turn their back, and then they don't know what to do. [There's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4856s) a kind of paralysis.

So in my book, I say that I think this is the relationship that cults make between the group and the follower. Because the cult is the benevolent, "We love you, we're the best thing since sliced bread, we're heaven on earth," whatever, but, "You leave us or you do something wrong, and you're going to burn in hell forever." And it's always, you don't know, it's unpredictable. You never know when you get out of bed in the morning [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=4889s) it's going to be. So you have no organized strategy to manage. You're always unbalanced. And that creates dissociation because what I've just described is really a trauma relationship. Because if you go towards it, it's more frightening. If you go away from it, that's frightening. So you're in this chronic, over-anxious, frightened state of tension for all your life, if you're born in.

And so that's what's called disorganized attachment, or a trauma bond is another word for it. And it's not that you're like that, it's that the situation made that relationship with the group like that. And now if we're lucky, you may have a parent in the group who is really a loving parent who tries their hardest, despite the cult, to find ways to give you safety. And some people aren't lucky. The group is always trying to prevent that. They don't want you to have any safety with anybody. Because if you have safety with someone else, you're going to experience safety and realize the group isn't safe when you get out. And in fact, that's the way a lot of people do get out. That was a bit what happened in my group. That woman confided in me. I felt safe with her. It provided a way out. Or you might find someone outside the group who you feel safe with. And that's a way out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5004s)

You described it really well, Alex, and it's fascinating. Because I don't know if Ross and Anne, you're trying to identify what you're explaining with our own experiences, and I think it totally sums it up. Because you've got the fear of the unknown, which is the world outside you've been told is wicked, for somebody inside the Brethren. But once you start to show some sort of questioning or dissent, or you start to have doubts, you then have on the other hand the unpredictability of what the powers in the Brethren may do as a result.

Would that be fair, do you think? Trying to relate it, the unpredictability of what the priests might do when they come and visit you. You know, will they kick you out of your parents' home, as in your case, Ross? Will they take your children from you, as in your case, Anne? And there's that huge, [scary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5065s) unpredictability. So you are on a tightrope, aren't you?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5069s)

Meanwhile, they're telling you they are safe and good and they're the only safe place. It's crazy-making because your actual experience is the opposite. And this is why the isolation is so important. Because if they don't isolate you from other nice, safe attachments, you have a way out. I guess I already said that. So to make it work and keep you in that state, they have to prevent that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5098s)

Yeah. And keep you isolated.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5101s)

Can I ask you, Alex, can we heal from this trauma?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5107s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5108s)

Great question, Anne.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5110s)

It is a really good question. The guy, the marvelous psychologist, John Bowlby, always said that. He said that one's attachment status is malleable throughout life. And if you later have safe and secure attachments, or better attachments, you get more securely attached yourself. But the same way, like someone like me, who, well, I had a complicated attachment status, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5141s) can go in the other direction too. So you may start securely attached but then get into a cult and get into this disorganized attachment.

But if, and I know for myself, because after I got out of the cult, I made really good friendships and I had a couple of good relationships, and I've got a nice dog now. You can learn what security of attachment is. And I learned that. And I learned, for instance, that I could fight with a girlfriend and then repair it. They call it the repair of communication. And I didn't know that. I thought if you had a fight with someone, that was it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5187s)

The friendship was over.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5190s)

Now I know, at the ripe old age of 69, you can fix things. Not always, you can't always fix things, but you can fix a lot of things. So yes, you can. But on the other hand, our early experiences certainly shape us, so it's more difficult if you've had those.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5216s)

If you've had 44 years. It's interesting what you say about, if you have a disagreement, you think that's the end. And this is something that I'm only learning now in my relationships. I think I've often run away because I can't cope with the conflict. And I haven't understood until the relationship I'm in now that there is a way to work through that in a healthy manner. It's not unhealthy. Well, that gives me hope that there is healing.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5256s)

Likewise. And like yourself, Anne, I still avoid conflict wherever I can. It's just my safety mechanism is to just avoid conflict. If there's something going on, I'll chicken out and just leave it be, sort of thing, rather than try and sort it out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5282s)

I don't like conflict either, I have to be honest. I think very few people do like it, but you learn to manage it. I think you can learn to realize actually conflict, if it's managed rightly, can be healthy if you're respectful and, as you say, you can work through it.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5303s)

Well, I'm going to say, I think one of the things I've learned is, especially with one's friends, usually people aren't trying to hurt you. It's usually misunderstanding that's what they're working through.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5316s)

Yes, they haven't set out to upset you.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5319s)

Yeah, unlike in a cult where they are setting out to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5322s)

Yes, it's a modus. It's been absolutely fascinating, Alex. I do just have one more question to pick up on, if that's okay. You mentioned earlier about cults being very hard to reform and usually will dismantle. And I'm thinking of the Brethren, because I always live in hope that they may reform and be how they were 60 [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5353s) ago—quite extreme, but not quite as harmful. It may be that could never be the case. I don't know what your opinions were on what happens to cults. I know some dissolve, and how it can end.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5370s)

Well, some dissolve, some implode from the inside when there's enough of a rebellion. I don't know that I've seen, that I can bring up examples of ones that have reformed. I just did an interesting study of kids who grew up, adult children now, but who grew up in this Kundalini yoga group, 3HO, Happy, Healthy, Holy. It was, you know, who had terrible [childhoods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5409s) and everything.

And the leader died, and then there was a whole, and all these abuse stories came out about the leader. And they've been actually doing a reparations thing for the women who were abused and now for the children who were sent to these terrible boarding schools. So the organization hasn't got its leader anymore, and they are kind of giving money to the abuse victims, but they're still [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5440s) so many of the same things. That main leader is gone, but they're still sending kids to horrible boarding schools, and they're still claiming that all these crazy, endless meditations are magical.

So how do you unpick it all? How do you get people living with shared drains again? How do you get people eating with other [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5474s) again? How do you help people think critically again? This is something you could look at with the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-day Saints, those in Arizona and Utah who had long pastel-colored dresses. Their leader went to prison for life. There's a woman, or several people, who are working with these loads of women and children, because that was a polygamous group, it was big, thousands of them, to kind of try to manage without the leader. And I don't know how they're doing exactly, but a lot of them are still wearing the funny dresses.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5519s)

And does that all stem from the brainwashing, do you think?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5522s)

Yes, I do think so. It's like, unless you go out of that bubble, if you're still in the bubble... maybe that's what it is, Jacky, now I'm sort of thinking about that. If you can't break the bubble, you're sort of still in the bubble. And if you break the bubble, it's not the same organization, because now you can go to the tennis club, you can join the Labour Party, you can join the Conservatives if of that mind. It just, I don't know how it would work. That's for you to think about because you know that group.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5563s)

It's something I've thought about a lot. Where is it going to end up? One thing we all know for sure is we want to stop the harm they're doing, and we want to try and reunite families. But the Brethren did have a day, I mean, my mother joined them in the mid-50s from outside, and it was nothing like it is today. And she'd been in it sort of several years before she had to say to her mother, who was never in it, "I can't have anything to do with you." So there was a time when they didn't [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5593s) this, they've always had separation, but they didn't have this extreme separation that just rips families apart. But whether it's ever possible to go back to that, I couldn't possibly hazard a guess. I'd like to think so.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5606s)

I mean, I suppose you have to think about which bits do they keep. You know, is it the hymns? I don't know, you have hymns, you know. I've always liked hymns myself. There's so much, it's almost like when you get out, you have to unpick all this and have to decide which bits do you want to keep. Like, I kept my, I mean, they're different, but I kept my feelings of wanting to do social justice stuff. It took me a few years to get to that, it didn't happen overnight. But I got rid of a lot of other things, like overworking and being rigid and all. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5654s) I think it might be the same with an organization. Can the organization unpick those things? I don't exactly have an answer.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5663s)

No, it's quite a fascinating discussion. The last question I wanted to ask, unless Ross and Anne wanted to ask anything, we know people inside the Brethren watch these podcasts. We hope they watch this one because I think it will give them a superb insight above and beyond their own world and above and beyond the ex-Brethren world as well. What would you say to anybody who is in the Brethren with a huge, I suppose, cognitive dissonance at the moment, where they've got this yo-yo in their head? What would you say, as a perhaps slightly more impartial person than an ex-Brethren member, to anybody who's got this sort of dissonance at the moment, where they're unhappy, they're on that precipice between the fear on one side and fear on the other side? Is there any advice you could give?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5727s)

Well, I'd say first of all, try to start trusting your own feelings about your own experience. Nobody has your experience other than you. That would be one thing, which is difficult when you're inside a group, but your experience is valid, and you can name it.

And the other thing I think I would say is, which we've talked about a bit, do a bit of connecting outside the group, either by research or talking to somebody at the shops. Any way of reaching, even in these little ways, is outside your bubble.

And then the third thing is just to say, [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5777s) though the transition is not necessarily easy, there's so much to enjoy and so much of value in the outside world, when you have your own freedom of thinking and freedom to make choices about the world. There's a lot of good out here. Difficulty too, it's not heaven on earth, but there's a lot of interesting and colorful experiences to have. So I think that's what I would say.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5815s)

That's really helpful. It's a bit like, I sometimes say to anyone that contacts me that when you come out, you have to make your own decisions, and you might not always make the right ones or good ones, but that's okay because they're your decisions.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5832s)

And it can be difficult to make decisions. It's very difficult.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5838s)

You're not used to it, are you?

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5840s)

But there are also, increasingly, people like all of us here and many others. There are people who will help you. You don't have to be alone anymore when you get out. There are places to go and people to help you. And not necessarily ex-Brethren, if you feel a little bit fearful of them because of what you've been told about them. Contact the Family Survival Trust, and we'll talk.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5869s)

Yeah. Thank you so much for your time this evening. It's been absolutely fascinating, and I think we've covered quite a lot, which has been great. We will put the link to the Family Survival Trust. Obviously, there's the Olive Leaf Network in New Zealand as well that's doing similar work. And we'll also put the link to the report that the Family Survival Trust did because I think it's a very interesting read. But we really appreciate your time this evening. Thank you.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5896s)

It was nice to meet both Anne and Ross. I already know Jacky. So many wonderful people when you get out. So thank you, Alex. Thank you. All right.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5910s)

Thank you so much.

### [**Dr. Alex Stein**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iAsWWzj0k&t=5911s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
