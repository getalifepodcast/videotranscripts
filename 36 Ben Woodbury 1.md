## Summary

Ben Woodbury from Windsor, Australia has an incredible and damning story about his life in and out of the PBCC. He also has a mind-blowing talent for putting his experiences and emotions into speech. So many things he said touched a deep chord with us, as he gave expression to experiences that we all shared but had been unable to form into words.
Ben recounts some horrific and traumatic happenings, but his smile, humour  and personality are living proof that he is in a far better place than the narrow-minded and brainwashed bullies that tried for so long to drag him down. Since leaving, he has gone from success to success and he shows us amazing photos of himself as a………...but you will have to watch it for yourself to find out what that was!

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=9s)

Hi everyone, it's Cheryl here. I'm attaching a pre-podcast disclaimer to highlight some issues that might arise from this podcast. I want to remind everyone that we were trying to create a landing pad for everyone and anyone to come on to tell their story and successes since leaving the PBCC or Exclusive Brethren. This will not look the same for everyone, and not everyone that leaves holds the same Christian faith as others. Many ex-members' faith [goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=39s) through many transitions, and it is not our job to give what we think is the right way to be. Our job is not to try and instill those Christian faiths back into anyone. Our job is to hold space for the survivors to tell their story. Our job is also to be the opposite of the PBCC and offer freedom of expression and freedom of self. You will find strong language in this podcast and discussion of different beliefs. Please listen with your hearts and open arms to each survivor gaining their courage [to](http://docs.google.com/https.www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=69s) come forward and speak. Let's leave the judgments and constructive criticism and forge a new way of embracing each unique individual. Thank you.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations podcast. Today we have Carmen and Lane with us and our very special guest today is Ben. And Ben comes from Australia with a multitude of things to talk about. He's got some incredible things that he's actually got to experience and do since leaving. But we're going to start off with Ben telling a little bit about his story inside the PBCC and what got him kicked [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=116s) and then we'll end the podcast with some of the things that he's gotten to do and accomplished. It's absolutely incredible Ben what you have gone through and what you have been able to stand up and accomplish post leaving PBCC. So why don't you start off and introduce yourself and let the viewers and listeners know what it was like for you inside the PBCC and how you got excommunicated.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=141s)

Sure. Well as you've just heard, my name is Ben Woodbury and I was born here in Windsor which is about an hour northwest of Sydney.  So not our direct interchange but kind of on, near, near enough to be a part of the Sydney, Brethren community. And I will try and remember to keep it very general because I know sometimes I can get caught up with the Brethren jargon and, and outsiders who like will like to listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=171s) as much as insiders and ex-leavers I'm sure will be very confused if we, if we, if I get too caught up with the Brethren terminology. So I'll try and keep it simplified but,so our, I grew up here in Windsor and I'm 31 years old and I left in 2016 when I was 24 years old. So I've been out coming up this April, it'll be seven years. And yeah, what a journey. I live in the same town I grew up in, was born in, which I know a lot of Brethren don't really do. Like when you leave the, the cult or the church you, um, you, you know, you want to put as much distance between you and it as possible, whereas I just really wasn't afraid of it and I'd set my roots here and, um, yeah, nobody was going to tell me to move. So, um, as much as I, yeah, as traumatic as that has been or, and, and was to begin with, I feel like in, in the flip side to that is I [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=232s) had to learn to deal with it and stand my ground straight away, which I think has got me to where I am today. Um, I, so where do I start? When I was a child, I think I was in year four, nine years old when I realized I was gay.

And I'd like to openly talk about my journey as a gay child, like a person growing up in such a homophobic, toxic community. They're very, as you'd know, if you've left or might be in there still closeted and you'd know what it's like to try and survive and push down who you are and hide what you are. Um, I never thought I'd ever speak up about it. I, I had an inkling I would [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=279s) day but I just never thought I would. I thought it'd be more about other people's stories helping other victims of abuse, not, not me being gay. Um, I, I think because it was just such a big thing to finally accept, you know. Um, gay men in general, without the whole religious trauma of being in a religious cult or upbringing, already have to deal with the shame of growing up in a straight man's world and dealing [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=310s) the fact that they're gay. So growing up from nine until I was, I think about 13, 14\. So I think it was like five or six years. I honestly thought I was the only gay person. So I didn't, you don't have, I didn't have much of a sex education at all from my parents, from the Brethren. It's a very taboo subject. So dealing or battling with my sexuality came from what I gleaned as a child from other kids in my class during primary school. I did [kinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=340s) to year six in a non-Brethren primary school and then year seven to year 12, so my high school grades, I did in a Brethren school. Um, and my family weren't, um, my parents weren't educated in, in terms of how to raise a child with sex or like, and then I understand most parents wouldn't, um, know, you know, their first child is always like, you know, but even more so in a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=370s), for want of a better word, primitive culture where you aren't exposed to or allowed to talk about where sex is such a taboo. So growing up I learned about my sexuality from kids, from books, and you know, I thought I was the only gay person in the world because that's all I knew until I was, you know, 13, 14 and I think I was at like, I was either at somewhere and I saw [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=400s) book or something that advertised the Sydney Mardi Gras and I was like, oh my God, there are gay people. And then I sort of knew about it and I realized that I wasn't the only one. There was a whole community of them.

So for those seven, eight years or however long it was where I was solely alone and in my thought that I was the only gay person in the world really made me, it was very isolating. It really made me have to deal with things like being alone, being comfortable in my own presence, and being comfortable with who I was, because I was like, this is me, this is, I can't change this. And every, you know, kid I talked to in primary school, like [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=443s) of hinted towards girls or things like that. I just didn't feel that or get that. So when I, in that time period, I honestly didn't see past being 20 because as growing up in the Brethren, you sort of have an understanding of when people get married or, and as a kid you're like, oh, when I'm 20, I'm going to get married. 

For me, I didn't want to because I knew I couldn't be honest with myself, let alone with a woman. So I was like, well, I'll never get married because I just, I'm gay. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=473s) I always had that mindset from a child that I would just end my life at 21 because I couldn't see past it. And, and to leave the Brethren, well, you'd never do that because you'd end up in hell. Um, so I had a very, very like short, um, perspective of life. I didn't, I didn't really put much into it because I was like, I don't see past 20\. And I don't, I think I dealt with most of that trauma or that, that, the, the way I was feeling with just humor. I really, you know, just sort of buried it deep in me and yeah, forgot and thought I'll get through high school and then I will deal with the fact that I'm gay and that I'm probably going to get asked to get married and then I'll work out how I'm going to [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=519s) my life.

And aside from all that, I grew up with a very religious father who was very manipulative, emotionally abusive, very toxic. And some days I used to wish that he was abusive physically so that I could pinpoint where the pain was. Because the hard thing now, like I've had years of therapy since I've been out, which I highly recommend for anybody that leaves, I realize that emotional abuse [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=552s) abuse that you can't see, that isn't bleeding, you can't see a scar from, is much harder to deal with and process and compartmentalize than, than something physical. So I really didn't deal with the lack of a father figure very well. And my mum, in the same sense, you know, women aren't really educated, let's be real, in the Brethren.

Yeah, you get a couple, but the majority aren't allowed to be educated. Yeah, they might go to year 12 or something. And the funny thing is they're the smart ones usually. In my class at school, the smart ones were the girls, and it's just unfortunate that, you know, it's a very 70s or even older mindset, the Brethren. It's very, they're very superstitious, obviously, they're homophobic, um, and they live in that world where men dominate, men rule, and, and women are second. Where [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=612s) mindset, I was always like, no, fuck this. I love women. My favorite bible verse growing up was where I think when King Cesare or something lies down and has a sleep in some woman's tent, I think Jael or something, and she gets a tent peg and slams it through his temple. I'm like, yes, go bitch, you get that guy. Like, I was like, why aren't women more exalted? Because I mean, in, in my eyes, like you've got, um, there was Esther, there were so many women in the bible, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=642s) that I would like, did so much more than I ever thought the men did, you know, I, I love it. So I, I always, you know, I always say supporting women since 1991 when I was born. They were, they were parts of me growing up that I found very conflicting because I was like, you, you say one thing, you, you know, we stick by the bible, everything in here is true, but your actions reflect something completely different. 

And, and that's, that's the hard part that I grew [up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=672s) I was taught to be honest and yes, I was not honest, I will admit that, growing up because I couldn't deal with my internal shame and that was me being gay. I am gay and now I know that and I'm okay with that. I don't have anything to hide anymore. I don't have to lie. I don't have to put on a false persona or the second person that I am because this is me and I'm comfortable with that. And if nobody likes that, that's okay because I've learned to be comfortable in my own presence. I've learned to be comfortable alone, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=702s) that's one big thing that, you know, growing up, my dad was always like, you'll end up alone or you're going to end up in the gutter, you know, pushing up drugs or you're going to end up by yourself. I'm like, I'm perfectly comfortable in my own company. I actually prefer it. I'm a funny guy. I love my own company. So I, growing up for me, learning that and, and yes, it was all a negative growing up, it can be looked at like that. I, to me, I'm like, no, that's giving me depth. It's given me emotional intelligence. It's given me all the things [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=732s) equip me with a straight white man's world that we live in. 

And I'm very comfortable knowing that. I had a, and a comment on, I don't really open Facebook because I find social media can be quite toxic, but I'm, I'm present on Instagram. But I opened up Facebook recently and there was one of those ex-Brethren group chats, right? And someone on there was like, really getting into it. Every time I open that chat, I feel like this one person always has something about a [scripture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=762s) or something. And I'm, I'm very, I don't believe in any of that anymore. And I, he was someone who put something up about gay pride or something and he had a scripture for it and yeah, he just really got into it. And I said, dude, listen to yourself. You're saying I can't bear to see this shoved in our faces, but every time I open up Facebook, you're shoving a scripture in our face. Like, some of us have dealt with a lot of religious trauma to find a community, the ex-Brethren group, and [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=793s) don't want to have to see that or face that again. You've gone from being a bully in one schoolyard to be a bully in another. So when I said that to him, he was like, well, where are you going to spend eternity? I'm like, I don't fucking know. And I don't fucking care because I live in this moment now and I enjoy living in this moment now. And that's it. It's really refreshing not having to worry and tread on eggshells for the rest of my life because I'm worried about where I'm going to spend eternity. There's no proof of anything or anyone coming back. And if you [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=823s) at it, Christianity is one of the smallest, shortest time periods or religions. The world is like 4.9 billion years old. Like if you understand time or math, and I wasn't really good at it, but I do have a concept of it. It's nothing. It's such a, it's a minority, and I'm used to growing up in a minority. I was a gay man in a cult. 

So I'm a minority within a minority. So I get really worked up when people get all like, you know, well, this is true. [You're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=853s) quoting a really old book that was translated by a really old man. And no offense to old men, but like the Brethren used to always boast and brag about how JND was so intelligent. He used to go wherever it was and, you know, because you weren't allowed to borrow Bibles or have Bibles back then. He used to, or the scripts or wherever he took it from and translated it. And they used to brag about how he would, you know, read it all and go home and memorize it and write it down. I'm like, how many of [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=883s) have been to the same party and seen an event happen there and get home and we've all got different versions of events? So how accurate can the founding member of this cult, his translation of the Bible be? He took it home on his own memory and rewrote it. Of course you're going to have your own influence on it. If you didn't like peas, you're not going to put that in the dish. Like it just, the whole concept, I'm like, it's black and white. You told me, you raised me to be honest and black and white, and here I am being that. 

Nothing has changed. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=913s) just okay being gay. So I have no filter anymore. And so I've never been afraid of them. And growing up, I think I learned to deal with that. Sorry, I've gotten off topic here, but that happens here. Oh good, I love you. I love it. Keep going. Keep going. So I, I then was obviously more open to the fact that there were gay people out there and I, I want to share these sort of details because I'll come back to this, but [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=944s) later when I came out properly to the Brethren, Bruce Hales got involved and he sent me four points. And his points were, there is no difference between, I can't remember them exactly, I did write them down, God, it's been a while. Um, there's no difference between the struggle with the flesh. There's no difference whether it's male or female. We all have to go through a Roman 7, the struggle with the flesh. For me straight away, I was like, well, if there's no difference, what's the fucking problem? Like with, if my mom lust after a man and I lust after a man, well, then how was any, you said there's no difference.

 I have a question too though.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=975s)

Because you said a really good word there. It's a very Brethren word that we need to talk about. What is the flesh? Are you talking about actual skin or this mythical, what is this mythical flesh thing? The love of the flesh, the desire of the flesh. I'm sorry. Okay. Let me explain this to you. If you're having a problem with this and you're in the Brethren right now, you can't grasp your mind about it. There is no difference between the flesh wanting [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1005s) do something and you wanting to do something that is one mind, like one brain.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1011s)

That's, that's what they are, and that's this is where I, I say that they are superstitious. They are the most superstitious community I've ever come across. The idea even, I know everyone has different beliefs, whatever, but the idea of a rapture to me is like Santa Claus. Like it did, and, and I used to have this argument with my dad, like he'd be like, I don't want to be raptured if, if it means that I'm going to have to, to hang out with you for eternity. I'm quite happy to be the other alternative because living 24 years of my life with you, that [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1041s) hell. So how could I, how, I would not want to spend eternity with you. And he... Imagine...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1046s)

Those hymns are forever.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1048s)

I know, right?

Yeah, no, not for me. And they also talk about things like, I'm getting off point here, but with that rapture idea, like, you know, because we're peculiar people, zealous for good work, peculiar? Yeah, fuck yeah, that's right. Zealous for, zealous? Yeah, maybe, but for good works? Now, that's a stretch. Come on. We've seen what you're capable of and what you do and how you treat people. You are not zealous for good works. So, for a start, if there was a rap shot, you wouldn't be it. You wouldn't be raptured. Why would he want to hang out with [you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1080s) I couldn't deal with that. So, back to my points that Bruce Hales gave me. One of them that I found was really interesting and why I want to bring it up and that's why I want to talk about my gay experience. He said there are many Brethren in the fellowship that have overcome it, far more than those that haven't. So basically he said there are more closeted men in the Brethren than there are that have left that are happy gay. So that for me was huge because I did the math of...

I've helped a few people leave and in my circle, I've got, you know, a group of us and there's nearly over half that are gay. So to me, you do the math, the ratio, these are random members that have left that have sort of sought out my help. And I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of gay men in there that are closeted and probably trapped. So I want to talk about this experience so they can go, oh, my God, I had a similar experience growing up. I felt just as alone. And men can see how I've dealt with it and how [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1141s) others that have left live happy and successful lives, peaceful lives.

So when I was like 14, 15, I was going through the paper when my mum was out at the shops one day, because obviously for outside listeners, we didn't grow up with music, radio, internet. And I didn't because I was from a different era. They have the internet now, but you can look up a bank or the opening hours of a cafe. It's not really the internet. You can't just look up Wikipedia and search what you're curious about.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1172s)

North Korea internet.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1174s)

Yeah, basically. So cult-like internet, and where it's all controlled by the Brethren. So I used to look at the paper, not for this reason, but I used to look at the paper when my parents were out. So my dad was at work, I was at school holidays and my mom would duck to the shop. I'd stay home and I'd quickly look at the paper because, well, there was sport or there was, not that I was interested in that. It was actually more The Phantom, the comic section at the back, because I was dying to know what happened to Phantom halfway through. So I'd be, I'd be looking at the car and I, and I [flipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1204s) over a few more pages and came to the adult section, the escort services section of the paper. And that really blew my mind. I was under, I understood what it was because with the straight advertisements in there, it's very clear. But then I came to a more discreet section where it said male to male with a phone number. And I was like, oh my god, there's a gay person, there's a gay man here. So I plucked up the courage. And I thought, fuck it. [15-year-old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1234s) me was like, I'm going to ring him. I have some questions I want to know. So I rang him, tried to put on my deepest voice and pretend I was a prospective customer or client wanting to know what he had to offer. And therefore I developed my relationship with this escort service guy that I got my sexual education from. So for the next three years over school holidays, I used to ring on a private number from my parents phone, this [poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1264s) guy from Parramatta, not far from me. And he knew, he was like, oh, you're calling and your mom's out. I'm like, yep. He didn't know my name. He just knew I was underage and I just, I just need some help. I just want to know some questions because straight away when he first rang, he's like, I can tell you're not over age. He said, how old are you really? And I was like, uh, 14\.

And again, because I'd call on a private number, so we kind of had to answer it. And no, I wanted to know. And it ended up being three years of school holidays, I couldn't wait for school holidays because I'd have a sex ed. Any questions, I was like, I've got hair. I remember speaking to my mom, I was like, I've got hair growing... Oh, talk to you, talk to your father, talk to your father. Well, I didn't. My father was never there or available or approachable even to speak to about hair growing in your pubic region. So yeah, I rang this guy and he, I [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1319s) my sex education from him and that's...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1322s)

Incredible.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1322s)

Yeah, it was. Looking back now, I forgot about this. I was like, when I was going through my last, recently I did an article with BBC and they're like, yeah, I was like, oh my god, trip down memory lane. It's like stirring all these memories. So at that point, I was like 16, 17, I was nearing the end of my high school. I just want to flash back to my primary school years and my high school years just briefly. Growing up in the Brethren, my [dad's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1353s) grandpa, so my great grandfather was Ted Crutcher, who was best mates with John Hales. And so that immediately skyrocketed my grandfather locally to leading position because his wife was Ted Crutcher's daughter. So it kind of like, they had like a bit of a power thing. And yes, I'm the shame of the family because I am everything they never wanted from their first child. But you know what? I don't give a fuck.

And if you wanted me to write warmly or speak warmly about you, then you should have fucking behaved better. And so... Amen.

I think that goes for most of us, right? So he was very  like my dad who grew up under a leading priest, so grew up very isolated, no friends. And I know this because of what other people in there have told me and I've observed why my dad had no friends, real friends, because he was basically a douchebag that just wanted to put people, get people in trouble. He was the first to, you know, pull my hand up and go, just so he could speak [to,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1421s) you know, another more high power brother, um, and say, look, I'm battling with my son, or, you know, this person was caught doing this. And I've spoken to a few other people that have left the community back in those days and yeah, they were like, my dad was basically a little rat. Um, you know, dobbing on people and snitching here and there. And which explains it, really explains why he's like he is. All that internal self-loathing that he just, you know, the only way you could find his own self-worth was bringing somebody else down. Hurt people hurt people. Sorry? Hurt people hurt people. Exactly.

 And he was one very hurt child. He didn't grow up in the most, let's face it, pretty much every family environment there is toxic because of the way it is. The very fact that people don't speak to their own families is a toxic trait. You know, you put church first or cult first and then you fit [flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1481s) and blood. So that itself, you know, sort of establishes the ground rules for how you treat people, how healthy a family environment is in there.

But, yeah, so my dad really didn't have any friends growing up. So because of that and because of his, you know, I remember I borrowed Phantom Comics off a student, a friend once, and I say friend loosely because it all turned to shit, but he would then get that father in trouble because they were being a bad influence on me because I borrowed their comic. And like, so in turn, the father would say, I don't want you hanging out with Ben, me, because he's bad, like [he's,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1522s) I'm just going to get in trouble. Like just, just so that the bullying that I received as a child and as an adult was incessant and, and going to school, like in high school with those kids and being bullied by them. 

And because as you know, you go to the same high school, you go to the same church that night with the same interchange. If you were bullied at school, you were fucking bullied at church. And when I was about nine years old, at the same time I was struggling with the concept that I was gay, all of those boys, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1552s) they're all cousins, got me, trapped me one night, allured me down the back and laid me down. And it's such a vivid memory for me because I was fucking terrified, laid me down on my stomach. And they were like, all of them, I think it was like five, six, seven, eight, nine boys, all cousins. And we're like... All Brethren? Yeah, I was Brethren. Yep. All Brethren. 

This is just an example of what my life in church was like at nine years [old.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1582s) They laid me down and were like, we're going to do the cold stone stunner on you. And they laid me down, which I found out what it was. And I was screaming, but I was right down the back and all the parents were up talking around the church hall. They don't hear anything because they think the kids are off playing nicely. And basically laid me down flat and pulled my head up till my neck snapped. And as a child, I believed that. I thought I was going to die. I was screaming for my life literally. And I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1612s) know why they stopped. They were like, one of them I remember saying, are we actually going to do it? And the other one was like, yeah, yeah. And the other one, I realize now he's gay and married and, and yeah, just like that, he would have been dealing with what I was dealing with. But because I have always been, as somebody close to me has described me, unapologetically me, even as a kid, I was always, this is who I am. I can't change it. So deal with it.

 [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1643s) a you problem. And so I think that irked him because I was more comfortable with being gay and he was a bit older and was probably dealing with the fact that he wasn't able to deal with it. And so at that moment, I thought I was going to die. And then from then on, they would chase you until your shoes came off and run you through bindi patches. They would hang you on a fence and chain my fan, and your parents would be like, why are your clothes ripped? Why are you crying? And another time, flush holding your head in a urinal at the church [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1673s) you are, you know, to the point where you think you're drowning, but also the fact that somebody else has just peed in that. Like, it's, it was constant. And that was, the only reprieve I had from that was going to school as a primary student to, to a non-Brethren school until that all changed now where they all lump them into one school and you go to the one church. 

No pun intended with the OneSchool Global, but that's what it's called. So yeah, my, I had the most horrific upbringing. I did not have a [safe,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1703s) loving family home. I did not, I know what a home is now because I have one. It was a house that I existed in, and grew in. That was it. There was no, there was no loving environment where I felt safe enough to even come out or even discuss. I had to ring an escort to find out about why I had pubic hair. I, it was, it was and this is an example of a good, healthy family in the Brethren because that is the image that it had. [And,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1734s) yeah, so from that was, that was just one of the more horrific experiences as a child and I was just never, never good enough. You were never, ever let to be a part of that group. And people, then you were bullied as to why you stood next to your dad after every church. Well, I'd rather live, you know, if I get in the back and I'm going to die. So it was that mindset of, you know, those primal instincts kick in where you've gotta fight for your survival. 

You've got to [live.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1764s) Even though I knew at 20, I was going to have to decide what, whether I was going to live or not, because so on top of the religious trauma, on top of the emotional family abuse, on top of that, you're also dealing with you're gay, and then on top of that, you're bullying. So it's, it, it really can fuck up a person. And this is why I believe that there are so many other people in there that just don't deal with it and they just resort to alcohol because by the time I could drink, I was fucking drinking. I was putting away [alcohol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1794s) because I couldn't deal with it any other way. And that is how the Brethren deal with being in that toxic environment is literally the crutch of alcohol. and then...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1807s)

Interject here for a second.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1809s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1810s)

I just want to say something for the listeners and viewers, especially if you are an ex-member. Especially if you're inside there, I want you to listen to Ben's story from your heart and not from your head. I don't, I know that there's a lot of people that are going to be holding some judgment. They're going to be having certain thoughts about what we're discussing and what we're talking about and how it's being presented. I want to just, I really, really [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1840s) you at this moment right now to drop into your heart. And I want you to listen to Ben's story from your heart as if this was you, if this had happened to you. That's what I want the listeners and viewers to do, especially if you're an ex-member who's struggling to relate to Ben right now. I think this is a super, super important and potent place for a lot of us to be able to learn how to get into. And I do, I get the emails, I get [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1870s) things. And it's something that I always stress that it's super important for us to come from the head on what you've been taught all your life to, to listen with, and I want you to come from your heart. Go ahead, sorry.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1884s)

No, that's all right. And I think that's really important because I, I do feel like I'm coming from a place now of, I've dealt with it and really I don't care what people think anymore. But I want you to know how I grew from an innocent child with not, not any understanding. It's as if you had to find food, right? And the only way you could get that was from some, yeah, maybe illicit means down the street,  [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1914s) as a teenager, young pubescent teenager, what, what was I supposed to do? We...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1919s)

Are a product of our environment. 100%. We are a product of our environment. And I relate, I relate a lot to the heartache that I'm feeling when you're talking in the sense that when you finally get the strength to stand up, you've got to make the best of it. And sometimes you're working with very broken pieces of yourself that have no way to understand on how the hell what happened to you happened to you and how do you take, like I, I guess that's, I guess that's why I'm just getting [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1949s) into this again is it's, it's unless you've lived in some of these shoes, people don't quite understand on how we are the product of our environment and how we have had to take these very, very broken and completely demolished pieces of ourselves and our soul and we've had to teach them how to walk.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=1971s)

Yeah. And to, and to give a bit of insight as to why I couldn't ask my mother because I know a lot will think, well, your mom's lovely and so is your dad or, um, what you see and what I got at home are two very different things. And if you think about your own self for a moment, you always put your best foot forward in public, right? Usually. So more so when you're under a microscope, which is that community that you're [in,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2001s) the Brethren, you're constantly under a microscope. You can't go to a cinema without somebody finding out. So it's to give you a bit of insight as to why I didn't turn to my parents for help or ask them the questions. I was the oldest child. I was constantly shielding my brothers and sisters from the toxic relationship my parents had. And now as an outsider, I understand it. So to give you an idea, my dad used to boast about this in every [break.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2031s) And I say break for the outside people that don't know what that is. It's dinner, lunch. 

So every social setting my father was in, he would, you know, give himself some self-worth or what he thought was giving him, you know, I look now as an adult that's done therapy and psych, you know, I can understand the psychology behind it. He was trying to give himself some validation. And he would basically tell the story of how John Hales, the current leader's father, who was the previous leader, [helped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2061s) him get married. And that was, my dad used to tell this story of how he was 19 years old. The leader at the time said to him, are you married? Why aren't you married? And he said, I don't know. I don't have a girl. Which really speaks for like, now I have secondhand embarrassment thinking my dad thinks this is a great story. I'm like, it really shows that you couldn't pick up a girl and that you had to have it pre-arranged for you.

 But that aside, because that's just personal, he was taken into the bedroom and basically he was like, John Hales took me aside into the main bedroom and, um, sat down with me and said, do you have any girls in mind? And dad was like, well, here's a list of five that I've seen at previous church meetings that I like. And he went through the list, John Hales, and was like, no, not this one, not that one, not this one. Maybe let's try these two. So this is the, the, um, and the Brethren have this concept that, and I was told this by a leading brother, so I know it's, it's and I've always heard it all my [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2121s) and you guys can probably vouch for this, but they have this concept that love comes after marriage. And so my dad went and saw one girl, but it didn't work out. And my mom was brought to Sydney fellowship meetings. And there's a big meeting where she was from Western Australia, she was brought across with her twin sister. 

And my dad saw them and was basically like, you know, I'm glad I picked the right one. So the approach to his marriage, there was no depth. There was no depth or communication or even, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2152s) not even allowed to find out if you like this person. Like my dad, my mom in the real world would never have married my dad and my dad would never have been attracted to her. It was just that the leader teed these two up and so this is it, this is what's happening. And, and as you know, what, what the leader says goes. So, and, and men often use that, like my dad would have, because I don't think my mom, I think my mom from memory, she was engaged to somebody at that time or had been. And I don't know the actual [story,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2182s) but I know that they were picking houses and like they were really into it and it was broken off. Now I believe it was broken off because John Hales said to my dad, there's an option. So when, when the leader speaks, you do what you're told. So my mom and dad, me growing up in that family, did not love each other. I've seen what love is. They're, they're a product of their environment and therefore, so was I. I grew up in a household or a family [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2212s) didn't know what unconditional love was. They didn't know what a safe, happy home was.

And therefore, I'm the product of that. And my, for example, a story that from growing up that I remember, my dad and mom were always arguing. And this fight they had to the point where they were driving along the highway. My mom said, that's it, Daniel, I'm done. I'm done. She undid her seatbelt. And as a child, as a nine-year-old, I'm witnessing this. I'm holding my brother's sisters because I was intuitive because I knew what was happening because I'd always hedged around and tried to repair [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2249s) relationships all my life. I navigated, mom's not feeling great. Dad, you need to stop saying that. 

Like I was the constant peacemaker in their relationship. So it was a full-time battle growing up. I didn't have any time to work on who I was or speak about me because I was dealing with two adults that didn't really, or should never have been together. And I, my mum undid her seatbelt and was like, opened her door. And as a child, you believe what you see. You don't know somebody's intent. I didn't [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2279s) it was to obviously, you know, get my dad to stop carrying on like he did. And she was going to throw herself from a moving car on a highway. And as a child, I just remember screaming and my dad coming to a stop at like some lights. And I'm holding my brothers and sisters, like it was traumatic. And I lived and dealt with that as a growing child would, trying to protect his brothers and sisters. 

And I constantly was seeing this, this mindset, this, this game that my parents were playing, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2309s) you know, even my mum would take us to the library as a child, as children, and growing up and we'd be given, um, you know, opportunity to borrow a, a book or a tape, a cassette, but we'd have to hide it by the time dad got home. So it was this constant us versus him mindset. There was no unity in this marriage. There was no love in this marriage. And this whole concept of love comes after marriage is just to get you fucking married [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2339s) stuck in there. And when you've got kids, and as I've known recently with somebody I've helped leave, and you've got kids, and you're stuck in marriage, it's really difficult to get out because they'll try and keep those kids before they try and keep the mother with those kids. I think also...

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2355s)

I think also it's, they're stopping them from having sex, right? So these people have never had sex before. And the only way that they can ever have intercourse is by getting married. So of course they're desperate to get married at 20, right? Who wouldn't be?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2372s)

Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't think everybody, like my dad, isn't, I don't think he is, I think he had four kids and had sex four times to be honest. So I don't, I don't, yeah, not, he's not that...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2384s)

Romantic. This really just lays out though like a fundamental issue that they have inside there, right? Like it's just, I get, I'm getting a little riled up and it's just, it's so, it just breaks my freaking heart on these fundamental issues that destroy lives.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2405s)

Yes. And, and they, they have such a big thing that we don't destroy families, we encourage them. It's up to the individual. No, the very families you create, you help manufacture, that very process is the problem, is the toxic, that the breeding grounds for this awful misogynistic, toxic culture, homophobic culture, which is my point today, that, that you raise people in. And [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2435s) this is why I'm giving you a bit more insight as to why I couldn't speak to my family or my parents about these issues. That's why I had to resort to a sex worker to find out about my sexuality because I couldn't even see safety in my own family. So just to give a bit of an insight because I know a lot of people will have a lot to say about this. Not that I care because it's my story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2459s)

It's good that we don't care. But at the same time, when you're trying to make a movement and why we're trying to move this into something, it is important to explain things. I do agree. And that's why I don't say what I say because it, I mean, yes, some things do bother me, but I just think, I just really want people to get out of a judgment mindset, listen to the heart and be able to put yourself in victims shoes when they come on [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2489s) when they come on the podcast and reveal what they have to reveal is you've got to be able to move yourself out of your head and put yourself in their shoes or put yourself as if what if this was one of your children?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2502s)

A hundred percent. And like, I, I, yeah, this is why I'm sharing or oversharing a lot of other bits and pieces that happen. And that mindset still hasn't changed. That mindset that your child might be right still hasn't changed to this very day, to sort of the last communication I ever had with my own family. And then to the feedback I hear from people within the community about my family still. So their mindset is still the same. The church is right, he's wrong.

There's no change in that. And then growing up, to give you some insight, I was a very religious child.

I prayed, I did everything possible because I had a bigger issue to face. I knew that I was gay from nine. So I did everything I could to pray the gay away, to change who I was, but it wasn't changing. So I had to look around me at what the truth was. I couldn't change it. It's who I am. So when I looked around me and saw that, well, it's not me, it must be [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2571s) wider community that is the issue. So growing up through high school, I would recall, like I would sit down because I was so badly bullied, I would pray for like an hour at night before every single like, before the day started the next day, at that night, I'd pray at bed. I'd have my school timetable and diary and I'd pray over every single period, class, bus trip, naming every single person, bully, a new interaction that would happen. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2601s) is for my whole high school years. I think year 12 I probably stopped because all the bullies had left by then. But I would pray through every single one, so my prayers used to go on for hours. And I'd pray all of this and then on top of that, the issues that I was facing, being gay, being, and I, to the point where I didn't even lust after anybody. I found sex like very, very, um, disturbing to me. And I, that's something I've to really work through when I first left because for me, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2631s) had put it so far in. I've thought about it so much because it's what I was taught. I was, I was homophobic to, to the point where I didn't, you know, want to exist, but I'll get to that. Um, and so through my high school years, I was really, really alone and, and also you're guarding this secret. You don't want to tell anybody about it because of the recompense. You are constantly, there's constant derogatory slurs where gay is synonymous with the word shit. 

So if [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2661s) doesn't go to work or it doesn't look good, it's gay. That's such a Brethren terminology to say, if it's not good, it's gay. So it was more with young kids. So you grew up surrounded by this constantly. You grew up learning that the Brethren are warned not to go near the city when it's Mardi Gras because of the abhorrent evil, the people from, you know, from the pit itself. Like, so you grew up knowing the very worst, you were one of the very, very, very worst of sinners, basically. So [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2691s) a lot, it's a lot to process. On top of that, the bullying, whatever other trauma you faced, and, you know, abuse. And there was a moment in high school where I was left alone in a detention room. And one of the bullies came over and I was in year seven and basically said, how big's your... And I obviously was terrified and didn't say, I was like, and everyone was laughing, all the boys were laughing. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2721s) then he basically leant down, grabbed my crotch and said, okay, it's that big, went up to the board and proceeded to draw Ben's... and...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2731s)

This is Brethren, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2732s)

Yeah, this is my first year at high school in a detention room.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2736s)

Okay. I just want the listeners to realize that this is not a public school. This is OneSchool Global that he is referring to, what happens with the bullying inside there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2746s)

And, and, and hearing other people's stories of what happened inside that school, even to date since I've left, I've gotten away lightly. And I'm not minimizing what happened to me. I am accepting that it was a horrific experience, but what's happened to others is horrendous. So it's not, you're not free from being under this Christian umbrella, this, you know, these good people, peculiar for zealous for good works. [You're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2776s) not free from it. And I think the whole point in bringing this up is I want everybody to know you're just normal humans and the people in there. It's okay that we're not all perfect or we're flawed humans. It's just, it's about how we sit in that uncomfortability. It's about how we process it. It's about how we deal with being alone. And just living in the moment, not like tearing other people down just so that you feel better. Or, you know, it's very much about you're just all human. You're not [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2807s) special person. You're actually an average human.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2810s)

That's key. They're not special. And what grinds my gears is the irony that this kind of behavior happens, and yet they claim that they were chosen specially by the creator of the entire fucking universe, which is infinite, by the way. The infinite universe, the creator, chose them as a special people. Yet this kind of bullying and disgusting behavior goes on at their schools? You're not [fucking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2841s) chosen for shit.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2842s)

And this is why I had that laugh before. I'm like, chosen, he'd want to hang out with you? Really? For all eternity, for not, for endless time? I couldn't think of anything worse. That would be hell. This is why I say that because I know that my 24 years in there, apart from the years I don't remember as an infant, were hell, were a living hell. And hell to me isn't pain physically brought to you by fire because there are far more worse pains in [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2872s) than you, that aren't tangible and that's living with toxic people in a toxic environment. And that's what I grew up in. And this is what I want to reiterate to the people in there that might have gone through a similar experience, um, and, and, and also moving forward about how I left. I want you to know you can live a peaceful life. And it's not all happy and it's not all sad because they're just emotions. They come, they go. That peace, yes, it flows forever. 

That, that safe environment you can, you are in, it's there forever. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2902s) and that's, that's the beauty of it. Like if you can sit with the uncomfortability, if you can sit with, with your emotions and honor them because some days you are sad. Like coming up, the early start month of April, I, I have a moment where I'm sad because I left a very, very, you know, big part of my life behind, um, seven years ago will be this April. So I'm, but I'm, I'm okay with that. I look forward to processing those emotions. I look forward to sitting there in that sadness and that silence [alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2932s) and thinking about what I left and then the next day I'm fine. I move on, you move forward and look at the life you have in this moment now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2940s)

Oh, you couldn't have said that was...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2942s)

Amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2943s)

That is, that literally sums it up. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2946s)

That was perfect. Should we, uh, should we go there? People do. That's what years of therapy will do.

Right. I, and I do, I wouldn't be alive today if I didn't have my therapy either. I mean, I just had to do a bunch of therapy all together to get over a big huge crash that I just went through. But you know what? We're humans, we pick ourselves back up and we get to, the thing is, you can't get this kind of healing inside there, right? I sometimes think that my mom let me go because she knew I would not be able to get the healing I needed in there and the only way I could heal what I went through was by leaving.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=2978s)

A hundred percent. And also Cheryl, you don't get that growth, that emotional intelligence, that emotional awareness just for yourself, not about like other people, because that comes, but for yourself to know when you're not having a great day, to know that when you are having a great day, to be in that moment and celebrate you as a human and know that just, we are flawed, we're human, we will fail, we will let people down, people will let us down. So don't hold yourself to such a high standard and don't hold others [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3008s) such a high standard. We are just all human beings. Yeah. Um, so back to my timeline, I'm trying to keep it, sorry. Um, then I left school and I worked for my dad for a year and that was again, hell. I was working for the same man I was living with. Wasn't a fun time. And, then also was going through moments of being rebellious.

 You know, I loved music and I loved movies and I, so I explored that region.  [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3040s) then I remember I got an iPad or iPod. The other thing too, I want to draw a reference to because someone, like someone has asked me a couple of times, people have asked me, you know, if you didn't know, and, and we talk about it and I'm very open about sex. So I don't, it doesn't bother me. And so I do apologize in advance if this is triggering for anyone, but I didn't know what masturbation was until I was like 15, 16, because I grew up in a very safe, sheltered family, right? But the flip [side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3070s) to that is you as a child want to know more. And if you can't ask your parents about it, like me, you reach out to what might be considered awful extremes of learning, like from a sex worker. So when I learned about masturbation from that person, from the sex worker, I then discovered what it was.

 I was later in my life, but prior to that, um, just to give you a bit more insight as to my high school years as well, I would come home from [school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3100s) and I'd be crying or my mum would be, you're in, you're in high school now, why are you crying for? That sort of mentality. You're a man now, you don't need to cry. You're not 12\. So I have found no solace or comfort there. So I would go and sit in the shower and just cry in the shower for hours. And my mom would come knock on the door and be yelling through the door, the lord knows what you're doing in there. And, um, the reason I'm saying this is I didn't know what things like, I, I assume she thought I was masturbating or doing something wrong because that's all I can think of. But yeah, um, I didn't know what that was until many years later because I started, I was, you know, when I started, um, high school, I think I was 12 years old or 13, and I didn't know what that was until four, four years later. 

So for four years, this constant berating of like, it's, it's not a, it's not giving you a loving, my point I guess is it's not, it's not creating that, fostering that [loving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3161s) environment for you to be able to come out and go, well, I'm actually just crying. I tried to tell you when I got home from school and I was berated and told to be a man. And yeah, so just to give you some more insight as to why, you know, um, why am I a product of my environment? Um, and so when I left school and worked for my dad, towards the end of the year, I was like, I cannot do another year of this. I'm actually going to leave the Brethren or commit suicide. So I decided after making a couple of friends through work, I was like, I'm going to leave.

 I realized there's gay people out there and a community where I can be safe. I didn't know to what extent, but I was like, I'm done. I'm leaving. I told my auntie and she rang me back because it was a different time zone and was like, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3207s) know, whatever you're going through, I know of somebody that was even gay and now he's married and got kids and he's been cured. So in my mind, I was like, holy shit, this, this actually works. This, this is, this, and this was the second time I'd heard this. So quickly flashback to high school years, my mum caught me once with a magazine, a DNA like magazine, like some men's health, but it was a bit more sexualized. It wasn't exactly porn, but soft porn basically, magazine in a, in a shop [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3238s) I, a newsagent, and my mum caught me with it. 

And then on the way home in the car, she's like, you're going to have to tell your father. I don't have to tell him, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, no, like just keep between us. And that night in the laundry, I was speaking to her about it and I said, you know, I'm not that, I didn't say gay because I was, I hated the word. I was like, I'm not that. And she's, she's like, no, I know. But I said, what would you do if you found out your son was that? And she said, oh, I would have made him have the operation where you know, because you know when they're a child, because they play with dolls and Barbies and you just know from a [child.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3268s) So I would have made him have that operation they have, you know, to fix it. And in my head, I'm like, well, you should have known because I was playing with Barbies and dolls as a child. So you know,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3278s)

Denial, in denial.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3280s)

Yeah. So I, and I knew in that moment that's when my mom knew and she would have just, you know, like that cognitive dissonance, you push it all down and you do not ever think about it again, um, and regardless of what facts you're presented with. So at that moment, I was like, okay, there's an operation. So I remember spending lifetime at the library where I was supposed to be doing project work, looking at operations. I couldn't find anything. I was like, there's no, and I used to think [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3310s) my head, maybe that's why everyone went to Mayo. Like maybe there's a special clinic in America. I was Googling, Googling. I could not find an operation or any mention of where it could fix you. To make you straight. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3321s)

No, it was the … operation.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3323s)

Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

And yeah, then I, I asked, ended up asking a teacher and she, who was knowledgeable in, in science. And she said, there is nothing to change who you are. And there's nothing wrong with who you are. And although they never knew, and I never said it, I knew what she meant. Yeah. And from that moment, I was like, okay. And she's like, made reference to a relative or something. And that's when I knew if that person, if one person accepts me for [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3355s) and likes me for me, I'm going to be fine. I just need to learn to do that myself. So cut to when I left work and my auntie told me there was somebody she knew that was gay that was even fixed. Like what you're dealing with can't be that bad.

I then realized when she called me again, I was going to come out to her. So I came out to my auntie first and I said, well, actually I am gay.

And it was so traumatic. Like I was in the backyard, just sobbing and crying. It was such a horrific experience coming out. Like you, it felt like you were just at the door of Hades or the door of heaven. You couldn't get in. You had to confess what you were. And then it was up to that person receiving that as to whether you're going to hell or not. That's, that's how it felt. So I, in that moment, you know, I'd led from nine years old till I was 18\. That's like nine years of my life. So for over half of my [life,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3410s) I had believed I was destined to hell. I lived in a lonely, isolated place of not being who I was because I was too afraid to be who I was because I was not loved as it was. I didn't find love or happiness as I was, let alone coming out as who I really was. 

So when I told her that she's, and I said, I don't want my family to know because all my life, my parents, I'd heard ridicule from the men [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3440s) had left, obviously later on I'd heard this, that they were gay. And I, I didn't, I just didn't want to be that disappointment. I already was a disappointment to my family because I wasn't, you know, interested in the business and I was the eldest child and it's all that, that, you know, 70s mindset of failing as a man. And so I, she said, all right, are there any priests locally that you trust? And I'm like, well, not really, but this is probably the only one because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3471s) know he's like a very sharp, no nonsense guy. Like I can be, I know he'll be honest, well, I thought. And so he came around and I confessed to him and a similar experience to Craig, it was like, they don't know. They don't know how to process this. They've never had to deal with this. I think I was his first case even. So let alone being a gay person as well. They're like, how gay do you think you are? And I'm like, well, in my head now, I'm like, what, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3501s) Britney gay or Beyonce gay? Like, I'm pretty gay.

So I've never had a girlfriend. Does that make me a platinum gay? I don't know. Like it's... They're just so uneducated. Very, very primitive. It's their whole mindset. They are very narrow minded. Like it's, it's, and it's because of their, their product of their environment. They're very much, you grow up under a rock. You have the vision of the shadow of the rock. That is it. There's nothing beyond the dark land. And you don't want to, and I quote their own scriptures where they're like, you don't need to go to fool's hill to find out about it. Well, you're really just taking, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3536s) know, Chinese whispers to, to grow from then rather than experience it yourself, myself. 

So I was sent away to Melbourne for a few weeks, where when I got there, I was told, I explicitly said, I do not want my family to know. And I was 18 years old. I was like, I do not want my family to know. The next morning I woke up, we spoke to Bruce Hales, and he's the BDH, and he's suggested, and your parents have been told. He said, it's best if your parents know. I was absolutely [devastated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3566s) that my coming out story was robbed from me. Like I felt, I felt violated. I didn't want to ever see my family again. I didn't want them to know. They already despised me enough as it was. I didn't want to, I felt I didn't want them to know this, the last part of it, like where there's nothing left to hide. And so from there, I, it was the most from 2010, uh, 2011 when I came out through to when I left 2016 [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3596s) the most like a rollercoaster...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3600s)

I can't even imagine.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3602s)

Yeah, like I, I was sent then to work for, um, the leader's son-in-law. So you know, that was like my dad loved that. You know, he could toot that to everybody. He loved that, you know, well, he's working for the leader's son-in-law. Like it was a big thing for my family to go work there. Whereas I was just, it gave me a bit of confidence, I think. And that was it. Like I was, I didn't, yeah, it, but you were constantly scrutinized. You, you're working in a workforce that's very [male](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3632s) dominated and it's very homophobic. And I had one worker say to me when I was acting a bit rebellious, so what are you going to do, leave? Go and live with your boyfriend in Sydney in a unit? Like it's that concept constantly. 

So it's like everybody knew, but nobody came out and said it. And you're living with that constantly. So I just, it really just toughened me up. I really just was like, everybody knows, I don't care. Like, what's the, like as much as I was like, I hope they don't. Um, and so from that, that [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3663s) I worked, I got a taste for creativity because I, I am a creative person and, and I used, I, you know, got a taste of interior design and things like that whereby I created, I think my first furniture piece, designed my own first furniture piece. And just to give you an idea, I was like an encouragement case through those five years. I was sent to live with different people. 

I didn't like living at home. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3693s) then it got to a point where I couldn't take it anymore and I, um, went to the local river where I first came out to my priest and wrote like a goodbye and took pills, drank myself silly, and was going jump in the river because the river here is very, um, it's not a safe river. So you, most people, you know, there's a lot of deaths there. So I was just like, I'm going to end my life here. And I tried to commit suicide and the next thing I remember waking up to ambulance and people around me and I was, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3723s) know, then I was taken, not by the ambulance, but I was taken to, Met Penrith Mental, Nepean Mental Health, um, where I chatted with the lady in there and I was meant to stay there for a bit and I just said to her, look, I am coming. I'm gay. I'm going to work out how to get out of this. I live in the Brethren community. And she was like, I know, I, I, I know this. I know these people. I know. She's like, okay, what do you need? And she's like, we're going to send someone to speak to you. Do you need help to get out? I'm like, no, no, I just need to get my finances in order. And then I'm going to quit my job and [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3753s) going to leave. Just let me go home. Please do not leave me here. 

And I was like, this has been a huge wake up call. I love life. I realized I can get out, and yeah. So she let me go home that night and, um, they came and spoke to me and that, my family weren't allowed to be around. So we sort of had this conversation outside and yeah, since then, they sort of checked up on me. And cut to, I think, sorry, that was somewhere towards the end of my working at, for the [leader's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3783s) son-in-law. And I just, I just don't want to name names. So I, yeah, using just, but just to give you an idea of how powerful it was working or what it was like working for somebody powerful, who I believe might even be the next, um, leader. But anyway, we'll get into that another podcast, but, um, there's a lot of stories there. So he, I sort of became difficult for me to be in that environment [anymore.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3813s) And we had this sort of discussion around the table, like we're going to make you redundant or like find you a job somewhere else, or you're doing your own business on the side, like interior design, maybe you can do that. 

And I was just like, you know what? This is it, I'm going to resign. So I resigned and I left, I think like six months after that. But before I left, I created this furniture piece, and one of the suppliers of the fabric said, [oh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3843s) you should enter that into the Australian Contemporary Design Awards. And I was like, no, I'll get in trouble. And they're like, no, no, come on. Like, otherwise we will. So I was like, okay, let's do it. So this is my first furniture piece that I did. And yeah, I was a finalist and I had a photo with Darren Palmer, which I was super proud of because even though he's a gay man, I was like, he's in Interior Design in Australia. And [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3874s) it coming up?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3875s)

It's okay. I'll go on. I got to go back in. It's not coming up.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3878s)

That's all right.

We're excused from knowing how to use technology. All right. We didn't grow up with it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3889s)

I got it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3890s)

Yeah. So that was, that was a really, like, it was a really a boost in my confidence. There's my gay chair that I created. Everyone thought it was awesome. That is so cool. I love it. Finalist. And I was super proud of that. And that was my other piece. And that's Darren Palmer who I had a photo with, which I was too scared to share with anyone, but I kept the photo. And then if you go to the next image, um, that was a furniture piece I created and I updated LinkedIn, my LinkedIn profile with that [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3920s) all hell broke loose in the Brethren community. That photo went viral basically and I got told to take it down, otherwise, well, I was going to have to be spoken to more strictly by priests. 

So, and those red, why I wore those red pants to a church meeting once and I came home and washed them and my mum, I, I asked my mum where she'd put them and she had said, I, you're never wearing those pants again. And she'd cut them up, like she'd basically thrown them out. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3951s) what it was like trying to be yourself. So that was me as a Brethren. As you can see, I didn't really fit in. I did everything to not, to make a point. If you go back a few photos too, Cheryl, just to touch on the type of emotional manipulation I worked with, was dealing with my dad. One day I went out for a drive in my car and I just was sitting at a KFC actually, just listening to Rihanna, some music or something, because I was so fed up with my family, or particularly my dad. And I came home to [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=3981s) pillow sitting at the front door at 10 o'clock at night or 10:30, because it was a Saturday night and a note from my dad saying, sleep in your car, because I never had keys to the house or anything because I wasn't to be trusted.

Yeah, so this was the type of mind games. And then if you look at the next photo, this is like another thing that sort of spurred me to leave the church is I was looking through. I had some paper in a printer and I just, my grandpa never had a computer. So I used to have to go and put his papers that were printed out for him on his desk. I found an email with my name on it. So I was like, okay, this is interesting, which I haven't [shared,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4024s) but I will later on, all about me, detailing about me. So I already knew that they were all talking about me and what to do with me. And then I found this on my grandpa's desk just sitting there. So basically it says, this is my grandpa's writing, 6:30, what to do, what do you want for tea? This is obviously my dad speaking. 8:45, we are going to bed. 9:30, I locked the door. 10 p.m. I came home and that's when I found the note. And then this is my uncle Russell and Elton, who's a local priest, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4054s) who was my priest. And basically their conclusion was they would never have him in the house again.

 So this is the type of environment my family, my dad was raising. That's, that's my grandpa's writing. Like, so my grandpa, this is generational that my family have, you know, that I grew up in an environment like this where it's like, we will all have a round table discussion as to what to do with your rebellious child, um, and leave it to your younger brother and a local [priest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4084s) as to what, what the outcome should be. And it was like, he would never have him in the house again. Like it's, it's very, um, as you can see, unloved. Like it's very toxic that environment like to try and grow up in. And this is just a small part that I've shared. Obviously, I've got a lot more that I've accumulated and found over the years, which in time I'll share. I just wanted to sort of keep it brief, but I'm also conscious of the time. So if we cut to modern [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4114s) where I left off, I started on Instagram. Obviously, I got on social media when I left the Brethren. It was probably the hardest thing I ever did.

But I shared my journey, my life, because at that time, I was the only one that had left and I knew that others wanted to leave. So I felt like I was kind of forging a bit of a path here. And I wanted to share my life experiences with, you know, previous members or other members, Brethren who still watch, who still watch my Instagram to this day. And if you are in there and listening to this and don't know what my Instagram is, it's just my name, Ben\_Woodbury. Um, follow us for some fun times. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4155s) basically this is just an example of the Brethren abuse that I have copped over the years. Um, here we've got have, uh, this is to my Christmas, have a happy gay time ban you fag. And it's such Brethren colloquialism. It's such a Brethren language. I knew, I knew straight away that it was a Brethren. Um, and just every, every, every post they commented on. So I've kept screenshots of all of this just to remind me, you know, [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4185s) I've come from and also to take note of the people that I left. And we did find out who this was and I got a formal apology from the parents.

And we'll always find out who you are. So...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4197s)

We really do, don't we? Yep, we always do. And it's so...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4202s)

Scary that they think they can get away with it. Now, this is where I got angry because this was a friend's who is now my business partner's shop. And they went onto their shop and they went to the police with this abuse. Love to let a bull run through this shitty shop for pulls. So the people that were supporting me, the people that were showing me love and acceptance outside here in this world were also being attacked. Another incident happened. A group of Brethren girls [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4232s) into their shop, took all my business cards off the counter because at this point I had my own interior design business. They took all my business cards off the counter and ripped them up and threw them all around the shop. Now, we have cameras, like it was all recorded. Like we know that there were Brethren girls and you know it's Brethren girls because, well, they all have the same uniform, so to speak. They all dress like 1970s style.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4257s)

None of the women wear pants.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4260s)

No women. And well, it's a bit more detailed than that nowadays. Like no one out here wears a puffy headband or a flat pair of Mimco shoes, but fake designer clothes, but not to get too personal, but it's a trend that probably back in the day, the boof. I don't know if you remember that, like a trend starts and it sticks for about 30 years. So you know when you see a Brethren person, you know it, particularly the women. But back to this, my friends, my family, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4290s) new family outside were being attacked and I didn't stand for that. So we found out who it was and we dealt with it. Um, but just, just to keep it real, I guess I'm showing this not to discourage anybody that ever wants to leave because I want you to, I want you to see you are living in the real world. You will come across what we call here, trolls. 

You will come across negative people, but in this world, in the real world, you don't have to have those people in your house. You don't have to go to church with those people. You don't have to have them in your [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4320s) like back in there where you'd get a list on a Friday night with who you have to have for dinner on a Sunday. And if you didn't like that person, like one experience, my mum didn't like the person, she stayed in the bedroom the whole break, the whole lunch. You don't have to deal with that out here. You have who you like and who you trust and who you feel safe around in your environment. And if you don't like that person, you don't have to hang out with them. There's no, well, no, um, what's the term they use no [special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4351s) friends. There's no like, you know, yeah, there's...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4353s)

No, there's no loving relationship. I want to say something too, if there's Brethren listening on the inside, that hatred that you say that you have for the world, that hatred that, that you, you love to hate the world and hate other people, that's a reflection of the hatred you have for yourself. And that's really sad.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4377s)

Yeah, definitely. I agree with that. It's just knowing what, what it feels like to hate yourself.  yeah, so from there I, I did want to briefly, I just looked at my notes, remembered to touch on like the understanding of, and I guess this is why I've been so open about my gay journey is, uh, the understanding of the Brethren mindset. Like I remember when I came out, my grandpa took me for a walk and he was like, do you think it was you watching the cows? My uncle used to have a farm with cows on it. He's like, do you think it was you watching the cows at the farm that made you think about being gay? I'm like, bestiality is very different to homosexuality. Um, and I was like, no, grandpa, I did not look at my uncle's cows and think, geez, those cows, what it feels like to a guy. Like, no. This primitive mindset or knowledge or [understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4438s) is, as you say, a product of their environment because they're not allowed to be exposed or learn or go to fool's hill to find out about the real world or about just general knowledge like that...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4450s)

The collective IQ of the Brethren is probably like five.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4453s)

Yeah. Well, and yeah, so they have that mindset too . I remember I was thinking earlier about the Hales family being like the royal family. So whatever they do goes, there's no questioning of that. And I remember like I used to work for the leader. Suddenly I remember him saying to me one day, he's like, you do realize I've married into the royal family. And I'm like, yeah, I do, because in this world, it is like the royal family. But the royal family, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4483s) you look at its modern day concept, it's not, yeah, it's, it's a very outdated system. And I do, I do feel like there's two candidates running for the next because let's face it, they're not going to be raptured or I believe, I don't believe in that. And I, there will have to be another leader. So, oh, you know those...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4504s)

Brothers are not going to surrender very easily.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4506s)

No, and I feel like the one, the one, the eldest one, the, the troublesome one, the one with ego issues and a God complex, if he's selected, that will be the downfall. I hope he is. I doubt it because he's too egotistical. But if he is, he will be the downfall of that whole religion because he will get in the way. And I hope it is actually because it'll be nice to watch it crumble. But I feel like my boss, the latest son-in-law, I feel like he's been groomed to be the [next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4537s) one. But that's a topic for another day. I'll, I'll just get to those other photos. Yeah, let's...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4543s)

Go into like the fun you have had since.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4547s)

Yes, I'm moving, moving forward. So moving forward, the negativity has brought me to today and I started my own business. I have gone from strength to strength with business. Yes. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4559s)

Can you see this?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4560s)

Yes.

And I just want you to know you can succeed out here. So here you see me. This is six months after I left. Let's start with this one

Okay. Six months after I left, my friends jokingly sent me something on Facebook and said, you should sign up for this. You've got great design skills. Why don't you go The Apartment? So The Apartment is like Asia or Asia and Europe's version of our The Block. It's like a renovation show where you renovate something and the prize is $100,000 and you're versus all other contestants, the only one winner. So I was like, sure. So I went to a contest for this and I was, yeah, asked to [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4600s) back and a few more additions and then they were like, sure, we're going to send you to Singapore. So six months after I left, I cannot even tell you the mind flip this was. And we were in a gated community and, and that's Jamie Dury, Genevieve Gorda and Laurence Llewellyn Bowen. And it was just like a dream come true. I still have the Brethren boy look to me. Blessed.

And I was just like a real mind. Everyone knew my story. Everyone loved you unconditionally. And, you know, I just felt so loved. I was in a gated community. And it was so strange because we weren't allowed to have phones or anything like that. So the environment was very similar to what I had just escaped from. But the difference here is that everybody loved you unconditionally. So it was just such an amazing journey or experience to even be on it, but also make [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4654s) amazing lifetime friends.

And then from that show, modern day, that is me in the soldier uniform standing next to Russell Crowe. This was probably the highlight of my acting career. I bet it is the highlight of my life.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4667s)

That is awesome. That is amazing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4673s)

I auditioned for a spot. Well, since that reality show, I've done a bit of TV work here and there and, you know, extra filling work, nothing too major. And then my agent messaged me once and was like, we're looking for a God for a role in the latest Thor movie. And I was like, can you imagine the irony of coming from a cult that worships a God to being a God on a TV?

I have to just for the irony. So I auditioned and I got it. I got the God role and the Spartan warrior role. So it was such, that's amazing. Um, and I got to meet, you can Google it....

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4715s)

It's like literally you can now.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4717s)

And one of my friends sent me this like, you know, you're in the cinematic universe now. And I'm like, oh my God, this is brilliant. That is so cool. Yeah, exactly. And then Chris Hemsworth posted this and that's me on the left. So it was, and I met Chris Hemsworth, I met Russell Crowe, I met Tessa Thompson, I met, um...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4735s)

Oh my God.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4737s)

It was, it was amazing. It was amazing. Um, it was just such a highlight of, of my, I'm like, I don't, I never even wanted to be an actor or I never even wanted to pursue this career. It just sort of landed on my lap and I took it. I was like, and this is what I mean by when you leave, you will not know what doors will open. Yeah. When I left back in 2016, I did not know that come 2022, I'd be standing next to Russell Crowe guiding his throne [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4767s) the latest Marvel movie. Like it's the whole, and, and as material as this sounds, it's about the journey. It's about, it's about believing in yourself, about accepting your, your circumstances or where you've come from and living in the moment and dealing with each hurdle, obstacle that comes your way as it comes, nothing too far ahead, not thinking too far back, just staying in that moment and enjoying it for what it is. And I look back now and I'm like, I've lived a very full life. I love my life. I love it. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4798s) very peaceful and I'm in control of who comes into it and who goes out of it. It's my life and you only get one shot at it. So why not give it everything you got.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4807s)

Yeah, absolutely. That was awesome. Yes. And you know, like if you think about it, they love to say at the church, right? How like, oh, God's just going to punish the shit out of you if you leave or we're deteriorating is the latest. Everything's going to go terrible.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4824s)

And this just proves that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4825s)

Yeah. No, it's, I'm glad you brought that up Lane, because that's something I want to touch on. The fear of God or God's discipline that follows you around forever. I'm like, going into my seventh year now and I can honestly say I'm at the point where I don't feel that anymore. And that's because I've done the work. I've sat with the uncomfortableness of it and really thought it out and thought I've had, I've been in hospital before, I've had the ups and downs in business and anything, but that's life. And this is the problem when you [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4855s) a community and say to this community, you are perfect, you are peculiar people, zealous for good works, you are special, you're going to be, ego, the chosen ones. 

You have this moment of like, when things go wrong, it must be because I'm being bad or it must be because God's punishing me or there's a bigger deeper message. No, it's not. We're all human and we all come across ups and downs, but that's because we are flawed and don't live in, we live in the real world. We don't live a perfect movie [life,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4886s) you know, just deal with it as it comes. It comes, you sit in that negative moment, you have a couple of down months, you have a bad year, who cares? It's about how you get up, how you move forward and, and get on with your life. And you take it, you sit in it, you sit in that moment of uncomfortability and, and know that it can't get any worse than this. So it's going to pass. And when it can't get anywhere, it only gets better.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4909s)

Yeah, I always talked about it. You got to make friends with all of the emotions. You have to learn how to sit and make them your, meet your goals. You got to get to know them. Why? 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4920s)

Say hi to...your demons. Say hi to your demons. Shake their hands. And I want to say something else. If you're inside and you're struggling with that concept of hell, I'm just going to reframe it for you. Why don't you call it Sky Daddy's Eternal Torture Chamber?

When you say that, you will realize how ridiculous that concept is. That Sky Daddy would have an eternal torture chamber if you play the game wrong. Come on, that's ridiculous.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4949s)

And I think, I think too, we can all relate to and break it down to is what is hell? It's the worst experience you've ever had. It's the worst feeling you'll ever feel. Well, have a think about it. Think about how worse, like in my case, my hell was 24 years back in the religion... Mine too. That was my hell. So I know what hell is and it's that. It's, it's, it's what, and life is what you make it. I live in heaven now.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=4977s)

Exactly. Same, same. Every day is beautiful, you know? And you can, you learn to love yourself and instead of having this hatred for yourself that they teach in the Brethren to your flesh, don't, your desires, no, do what you want to do. Whatever you want to do, do it because you'll realize when you love yourself, you don't have desires to do fucked up shit. Exactly. To be like, I can't, I, I need to have a streamlined three on my phone so I don't look up fucked up shit and chainsaw [murdering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5008s) videos. Well, guess what? If you just are a normal person, you won't do that, right? Just love yourself.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5014s)

It's the deprivation from, like it's like you can't eat chocolate to the point where you're hidden from it, taken away from. All you want to do and you're obsessed with and thinking about is that. Exactly. It's all these nitty-gritty rules and on fine line gray areas that determine whether you can or can't. Well, it's probably not if we have to question it, it's a doubt. No, it's a no. Like, no, life isn't about that. It's about the moment, it's about the connections with the people around you. It's about being safe and feeling safe enough to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5044s) you and to enjoy. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5047s)

When we create these isolated things like not talking about sexual education, that's one of my biggest pet peeves in what I went through that I, I, I really believe that if sex education was in there and you were taught about your bodily functions when you go through puberty and when you have these urges, what to do with them, that we would not have the pedophilia that's in there. We would not have the amount of things that are happening inside there. It is one thing that I fight for that sex education to the fullest extent needs [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5077s) be implemented in every one of their schools.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5079s)

And more so than what they have at the moment, because I know what sex education they have at the moment, more so being accountable. Don't take it, elevate it. Don't take it to your parents. I mean, yes, if you feel comfortable, take it to the police force because the Brethren have this mindset that they're above the law because if, well, he's confessed his sins. So who are we to hold them against him? Like Jesus has forgiven him. So do we know because then that person goes on. They got off scot-free, right? The punishment that they just got was a wet noodle to the back of the wrist. [Of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5110s) course they're going to do it again. You're encouraging it. You're creating an environment that's toxic for these people, these pedophiles, these rapists, these toxic misogynistic men to thrive in. And I'm not taking away from the fact that there are some toxic women in there as well, but... Oh, there is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5126s)

Yes.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5126s)

People in general, you're creating an environment that allows this to fester.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5131s)

Accountability doesn't come from saying, um, I did this and then they're forgiven in the same room in the same half hour. That is not accountability. Accountability, especially in my perpetrator's life, he needs treatment. He still needs treatment. He's got a long list of, of, of victims that he's got behind him. So does his father. Like it's not, you can't, you can't just sit someone in the room and say, well, you know what? He is, he's confessed his sins and now all is forgotten. It doesn't happen like that, not when you have a sickness like this.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5160s)

Yeah, Sky Daddy's not a real judge, right? Like you can't just tell Sky Daddy, oh, I did some bad things. It's all good now. No, no, no, no. Try explaining that to a real judge. You're going to see the inside of a prison.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5172s)

Well, we don't live in that world. We live in the real world. And the real world has a law, and has a system in place. So let's, let's, let's work with what we've got, right? Not what we imagine thinking our heads is out there. Let's work with what we have. And that's my point in being present and being who you are. Just work with what you've got. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5191s)

Well, I...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5192s)

Love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5192s)

I, you know what, we didn't get into, um, the articles that you were part of and I know you're also in an article about talking about the Windsor locality being moving and how your mom was really upset about it. We'll do this in another podcast that...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5205s)

Is like a huge conversation too, Cheryl. Let's do it. Let's do another...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5208s)

We'll have to do another podcast and let you get into, um, we really need to get into that whole situation that happened in the Windsor locality being moved. I will attach the links below in the description of this podcast with those so that we can be briefed, re briefed on it. And then we'll bring Ben back on and he can go into some of the other things that have happened around him. But I'm so appreciative of you coming on and being so open and vulnerable. Thank you so much. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5239s) I guess I just reiterated again to the public and the viewers and listeners that are listening to this to come from a place of listening to this from the heart and not from a judgmental mind or from past judgmental minds. I want you to be open and be able to understand that every single one of us that have left and have had a lot of trauma happen, that we are a product of our environment and we are doing the best we can. We have stood up and we have made the most out of our [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5269s) and you know what, we all walk with crutches, but we've got a lot of glitter on those crutches and we know how to make those crutches work. So I just really want to open that back up to the public and say, please listen to these podcasts from your heart, not your head. Thank you so much, Ben. I can't wait for podcast number two that we do with you and much love to everybody.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5291s)

Thanks guys.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je8q7nc-byI&t=5293s)

Thanks everyone.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
