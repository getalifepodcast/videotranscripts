## Summary

Join Abi, Gilli, Ross and Jacky as they go through their holiday season and what it is like for them now vs when they were in the PBCC. They touch on many diverse topics including the Deed of Variation. They also have messages for their loved ones in the PBCC and what they hope to see come out of this movement. Will 2024 be the year we see big changes start to happen? Let's all hope Bruce Hales wakes up and realizes that softening from the top of the hierarchy could stop the outrage at the bottom.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=6s)

Welcome to the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with Jacky, Gilli and Ross. And we're here today to talk about the holiday season that we've all just had. So I'm wondering what everyone's been up to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=20s)

Well, I'll start. I mean, we're in between Christmas and New Year, and on Christmas day we went to my daughter's and I had my little two-year-old granddaughter there and my other little granddaughter and we had a really nice family day.

What I couldn't help but think was how lucky and blessed I felt to be able to have that when you consider so many of our friends, not just the four of us, but so many of our friends have got family they would love to see on Christmas day and that's been denied them. I'm thinking of people like Anne who can't be with us tonight, but you know, she's got five children and goodness knows how many grandchildren.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=71s) it felt a real privilege to have the kind of day I had. I don't know what Gilli and Ross did on Christmas day.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=77s)

So I went over to a friend's on Christmas Day with another friend, and my friend that hosted us had her friend and neighbour in as well, so there were four of us all together. We had a really, really good day actually, probably about half past one and didn't leave till after midnight. We played lots of games and did all sorts of, yeah, it was brilliant.

You know, before, obviously I went to my ex-partner's parents every year, and I actually found that quite stressful because there was always an argument for one thing. And also it made me think of what I hadn't got as regards my own family at Christmas. So to go to a friend, it was actually nicer than it used to be going over to my ex-partner's parents, to be honest with you. So that's what I did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=138s)

Do you think Ross that was possibly because you were with three other friends, and none of you had family there? So you all had that camaraderie together and you weren't trying to pretend to be a family, whereas if you go and join on another family, you're perhaps trying to do the fact which hits home that you haven't got your own mother and family with you?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=160s)

Yeah, definitely. Because all of us are on our own in the normal way. Like my friend in Peterborough, he's on his own. My friend's on her own and also her neighbour is. Yeah, I think you're quite right. It felt like we were all in the same boat. And as you say, when you tag on to somebody else's family, you automatically try and fit in. But it's not the same as having your own family. Definitely.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=190s)

Yeah, we were with family, only a quiet one this year. But yeah, I think it's interesting what you say. I think you definitely do feel that effort to try and tag on, and it can become almost, it can almost become stressful because you are concentrating so hard on trying to fit in. But at the same time, you're missing your immediate family.

I know not everyone, you know, everyone has different, you know, obviously not everyone's able to be, especially if you've got two sides of the family. I mean, not everyone goes to their side of the family on Christmas Day, you know, often alternates with, you know, in years, doesn't it? So, but yeah, that is, it can certainly be stressful to try and latch on and to try and make sure you are fitting in.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=268s)

Yeah, it's an interesting point actually because both of our daughters have parents on their partner's side, so we literally alternate Christmas. So they'll do one with their partner's parents and then they'll do one with us. But I think it's very different knowing next Christmas we won't be with them on Christmas day. That doesn't bother me at all because we have them this Christmas, we will see them sometime over the Christmas period.

They're not, whereas in the event of, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=299s) know, the separation that we have from families in the Brethren, you're never going to see them over the Christmas period, are you?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=305s)

So last year, which was our first Christmas, we were all hyped up because it was our first Christmas. And then this year, it was a bit of a reality check and a bit of a come back down to earth kind of moment.

And we booked a holiday, we went away. We went to this beautiful wooden lodge in the middle of the Brecon Beacons with no one around, a log fire and a hot tub. We had a beautiful Christmas meal just as us three and yeah, we did that from the 22nd till the 26th. So I came back Boxing Day, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=358s) it was just so nice. We've had a really hectic year and it's been really nice to just reconnect as a family.

And the pressure that you've been talking about, like with having to do with other people that aren't your own family, that just vanished. It was really interesting, so I was talking to some of my friends about what they did at Christmas because they have complicated family dynamics and they used to book a cruise. I think if you really miss your family once [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=396s) come out, I think it's a really good thing for you to just go away on your own.

Neither me or Bruce have got family on either side because they're all in the cult. So for us, I think going away might be our thing. Obviously over the years we'll build more relationships with more and more people, but I really struggle with the Christmas family-family thing because we don't have that, and a lot of people that leave won't have that either.

Obviously Jacky, you've been out a while, and Gilli, you married a non-Brethren and Ross, your friends are non-Brethren, so you've got that, you know what I'm trying to say. You've all got like kids-ish, Ross maybe not, but you've got relatives on the outside that you can do the family-family thing with. Whereas we were still on our own.

So yeah, we've really enjoyed getting away. And then 27th, we went to some of Bruce's family that left in like 19, just [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=471s) Aberdeen. So what's that, 1960 or something? So yeah, we went to them yesterday and had a really nice time. And then Friday we're going to his other cousins. So we still have, and then yesterday I popped into my friends and we had a bottle of wine and some nibbles.

I think, do you know what I really hate about Christmas though, is the amount of money people spend.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=506s)

Yes, it's really shocked me. I will, don't miss, yeah, this is one good thing I will say about the Brethren. They don't have the stress of buying Christmas presents. If there's anything good we can say, I will say that. It's something we never had growing up.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=525s)

Why is no one being like, people aren't buying Christmas presents for the right reason anyway because people aren't actually celebrating the birth of Christ. So why don't we do like a New Year's party instead and get all the stuff in the sale? No one's copped onto that. They haven't actually opened up to that and I'm like, come on.

But I felt really measly in the stuff that I brought Charlie because you look at all my friends on Facebook, there is lounge [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=555s) literally you can't see the carpet because of Christmas presents. And I'm like, is this normality?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=561s)

I think it's interesting, isn't it? Because I wonder whether having not been brought up with that Christmas as little children, none of us had that excitement of Santa Claus coming and bringing presents. It wasn't something we were brought up with at all, it just didn't happen.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=580s)

I did up until age six when my parents joined the Brethren, so I kind of had an inkling, but Bruce has no idea. Not that I can really remember Christmas either, I can remember a couple of my gifts.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=594s)

But I wonder if that gives us a more realistic view of Christmas, as in when you do see some of the extravagance.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=606s)

Yeah, that's one of the things I've really struggled with. People literally spending like a grand per child.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=613s)

It's not necessary. And it also takes away, you know, if you think about what Christmases were perhaps like in the Brethren, I mean, I don't know what you three remember being told, but obviously I did leave a while back so they may be saying different things now. But I was told as a child, you know, it was a pagan festival and we don'tdo Christmas.

Essentially, Christmas is a Christian festival where you remember the birth of Christ, that's as I understand the origins of it. And we were told, well you don't, you wouldn't want to do that because you're supposed to do [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=644s) every week at the Lord's Supper when you remember his death. So you don't have, I don't know if they're still saying the same rhetoric, for the justification for not having Christmas.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=656s)

Yeah, they definitely do. And there is definitely some influence from somewhere, I don't know if it's pagan or not, in regards to Santa and all that kind of thing. It all detracts from the real reason of Christmas. But yeah, I don't know if Santa's a pagan, I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=684s)

I don't either. What were your memories of Christmas when you were in the Brethren? I mean, obviously this time you've spent it with other families in the past since you've left and you spent this time with some good friends and had a really nice time. How did that differ from when you were in the Brethren?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=703s)

So yeah, I mean it's a job to say really because obviously my parents were quite free and easy. So whereas a lot of people would just be on their own because they couldn't do anything, my parents always had people over, whether it be relatives from elsewhere in the country or whether it just be locals that they invited.

So in that sense, things aren't a lot different as in having people around. But [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=735s), I mean, obviously you have to get to the meeting at the end of the day. You only have a certain amount of time with those people, so be it like three or four hours or whatever. So that of course was a lot different than it is now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=755s)

Yeah. And do you have memories of Christmas in the Brethren, Gilli, and how do they differ?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=760s)

Yeah, I think it's similar to Ross really, we'd probably either entertain or go somewhere. But yeah, like Ross says, there was always that pressure of trying to still keep the Brethren lifestyle, go and get into the meeting on time. And especially for a big family like us, it was always a mammoth task to make sure we were getting to a meeting, especially if we were elsewhere.

Yeah, it was very, I mean, it was very simple and yeah, there were no presents or cards or anything like that. It was just completely, in one sense, it was no different to a regular entertaining apart from it might be a bit more relaxed because you've got a bit more time. And you're probably inviting someone that you would invite off your own back rather than being told to come to you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=833s)

The other thing that I wonder is, Christmas, quite apart from it means different things to different people, but to a lot of people, whether they have a faith or not, it does mean family time. But even when I was in, I recollect that the Brethren very much discouraged spending time, you know, just going to see your in-laws or going to see your parents or doing things like that at Christmas because that was seen as not quite right. Travel bans...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=862s)

They had that right now, yeah, until 24th of February or something. Yes, we had some random date. So yeah, I've been keeping an eye on our Brethren neighbours and they haven't been anywhere. No, it's just pathetic. I bet you Bruce Hales is on holiday somewhere. Possibly, he's been like, no one else can travel, and then he's pissed off and everyone else is stuck in their own houses.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=895s)

Yeah, I mean, I remember a couple, I think it was Christmas before last, maybe two years ago, somebody inside telling me there was an official, you know, you mustn't travel over the holiday season without permission. So in other words, if you did want to go anywhere, only if it's for care or something like that, you had to give a reason and then you had to have it authorized that you were allowed to go and travel.

And so that doesn't seem to have changed. And what I wonder is what are they so scared of? What are they so [scared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=925s) of families? Let's say your parents live the other end of the country, what is the crime if you're taking yourself and if you've got children in the Brethren up to see your parents?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=937s)

Enjoying yourself. You're not allowed to enjoy yourself. It's flesh, it's Midianite-ish, it's all those bad things.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=947s)

Yeah. Also, I mean, the latter years I was in, I don't know whether they still do, but they all organise fellowship meetings and I don't know what all over the Christmas period just to keep the minions occupied basically.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=961s)

Which is one of the classic signs of a cult, isn't it? Is actually to keep the members so busy that they don't have time to think about what they actually want to do because there's always something they have to do. So they're always doing this.

And I also find it quite interesting because as we know, the Rapid Relief Team are quite active at Christmas time. And I understand this year they've been giving out food boxes and everything from their social media pages. And I remember a slogan that [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=991s) put out, I think it was three or four years ago. I'll share it on my screen.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=996s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=998s)

So this was a slogan that they put out about three or four years ago for the Rapid Relief Team. And I can remember at the time I actually sent it to my brother in the Brethren questioning quite what it, I didn't get a reply. Just like, hey, the Brethren are getting families together for the holiday season, let's do this. It didn't work.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1025s)

And what they don't actually, I've just noticed something on this, what they don't actually realize is they use some beaches next to the beach which is banned anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1036s)

Well good spot, Ross. I suppose it's the utter hypocrisy of it that something like this can, I'll stop showing my screen now, but something like this can be put out on their charity page and yet people like Abi and Abi's husband and Gilli and Ross and myself have all got family in but won't have anything to do with us, not even at Christmas time. And one half of me, we can laugh about it, but the other half thinks the utter hypocrisy of it leaves you speechless.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1068s)

Doesn't it? Yeah, and it's really sad because they'd love Christmas out here. Like, it's okay, we've struggled with it this year because we're back to reality. It's no longer like a whimsical fairy tale, it's back to reality. But we still absolutely enjoyed it. We've got Christmas lights up and a Christmas tree up and things.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1092s)

And that's the bit that really hurts. Christmas is fantastic, but there's that ongoing heartache, isn't there? And depending on your circumstances of the people who just refuse to have anything to do with you.

Gilli, do you remember your first Christmas out of the Brethren, the first holiday season you had and what you did? Because Abi, you mentioned your first one was sort of like, "oh wow, this is all new and this is exciting," and then the second year it's not quite as exciting. What were your thoughts of your first Christmas, Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1124s)

I mean my first, well technically it wasn't out of the Brethren because I left just the day after Boxing Day. So yes, that Christmas was a complete and utter mess.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1134s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1135s)

I referred to it in my personal podcast, but the Christmas day and the day after, they were genuinely the worst 48 hours of my life because it was just utter hell. But my first Christmas was actually out of the Brethren, I was actually in Sweden. I was actually in Sweden for that with our ex-wife.

And yeah, it was obviously Sweden, so it's very wintry anyway as a country. And yeah, it was pretty incredible because we visited the local theme park, which obviously had all the Christmas events on, all the ice skating, all that kind of thing. And yeah, just I guess, traveling. I think, I'm trying to think, yeah, we actually drove to Sweden [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1190s) year. So that was quite an adventure.

So yeah, and the other thing with, and it's not just Sweden, I know a lot of European countries do it, they celebrate, their celebration is on the 24th.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1205s)

Yes.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1206s)

So they have the sort of, you know, the family meal and all that kind of thing on the 24th and Christmas Day is almost like our kind of Boxing Day. It's a bit of a dead, you know, in a time to recover. Yeah. But yeah, it was, you know, we were with her family.

Very different to English Christmas anyway, just in general, because they don't have turkey, they love a variety of foods and seafood and that kind of thing. So yeah, it was, I suppose, couldn't have really been more different from what I was used to in the sense that I was in a different country. It was a lot of, at that point in time, I didn't really understand a lot of Swedish, so it was all new and exciting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1260s)

Did it snow?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1260s)

No, unfortunately not.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1263s)

No, shame. Yeah, that would have made it very different.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1268s)

Charlie pulled the curtains back at the lodge and he was like, "It's raining\!" There's literally snow at Christmas, no chance.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1277s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1277s)

One of the other things that I struggled with is, and I still have not figured it out, is when you put your decorations up and when you take them down. Like there's supposedly 12 days before?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1291s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1292s)

Why?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1297s)

Because the song says so. It's not because the Bible says, I don't think anyway.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1310s)

There is some tradition behind it, isn't it? 12 days before and 12 days afterwards.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1316s)

Yes, I think there is. But you don't know what it is either?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1322s)

Not off the top of my head, no. I do remember asking the question once.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1327s)

Okay, I might have to research it myself then. Research.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1331s)

No, exactly. Get your decorations up too long or up too early. How was your, what was your first Christmas, Ross? I can't remember what time of year you left the Brethren. So was it, how soon after you left it would have happened for you, the first Christmas, first holiday?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1346s)

It was about six months after I left. So I left, but I didn't move into my flat until October. So as you can imagine, I hadn't really got any furniture or anything. I just literally had a friend over and cooked for them because I didn't have anything to do. Otherwise I would have been on my own and that was only Christmas day holiday, I didn't see anybody at all. Thankfully that's changed now because I've got a big network of friends in Peterborough.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1376s)

It takes time to build that, doesn't it? Yeah, I mean my first Christmas was actually quite spectacular. It's a long time ago now. We had relatives in South Africa and I'd been out about eight months and my brother and I booked to go and see them. So we actually had three weeks in South Africa over Christmas and it was 85 degrees and baking hot and we still had turkey and a Christmas tree and we went to the beach.

It was such a stark contrast to what we did in the Brethren that it was [almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1410s) slightly overwhelming really, because you don't know quite what it's all about. But it was such a marked landmark. And I can remember thinking at the time, I mean, I was quite young when I left the Brethren, but all the years we'd missed out on, but then great because all the years we got ahead of us when we can just enjoy it.

And I think that's perhaps one of the messages, I don't know about you three, but what I would like to say to anybody in the Brethren, that Christmas traditionally in the UK is family time. That's what people view it as. Even families that don't get on try and make an effort. And I think it's a good time for people in the Brethren to make an effort and just pick up the phone and say, how are you? I don't know you three feel about that. What's stopping them?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1463s)

Fear. Fear of what? So fear of the consequences of talking to us, I think. Because why wouldn't they any other day? Why not, why just Christmas? Why don't they talk to us anyway? It's absolute fear of the, I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1485s)

Hell?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1486s)

Maybe, I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1487s)

I sometimes wonder if it's fear that they might actually enjoy talking to us. As in, you know, Ross, if your mum, you know, if you phoned up and had a chat, they'd suddenly realize that as we said when we talked about what it means to be an opposer, we are still the same people. We haven't changed. We're not, you know, sort of, I mean when they [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1517s) about us being...

I think it might just be fear that they might actually enjoy a conversation with us and might actually come off the phone thinking, "Hey, they're okay, you know, they haven't got devil's horns going out their head or something like that." And if they did actually just sit and talk to us, that little bubble, that little invisible wall might get broken down and then they've got a problem, haven't they?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1545s)

Yeah, and I suppose that brings me on to what I'd like to say to the high-ups in the Brethren is that please don't use the Deed of Variation and say it's a personal choice of the members, because it's not. It's your choice. If you said to the members, "You can speak to your relatives outside," they would do. It's all in your hands. It's not down to them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1578s)

Yeah, it's not a personal choice when you live with that amount of fear of talking to somebody outside the Brethren, is it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1585s)

No, it's not.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1587s)

No, but they do constantly use that, don't they? That it's always a personal, "Oh, it's down to the individual to choose." Absolute rubbish, is it? There's no way, there's no way in hell that anybody... It's a common question that comes up, you know, just with regards to anything about being in the Brethren.

If someone doesn't know the situation with the Brethren, they'll say, "Oh, why don't they just do this? Why don't they just go against the rule?" Because you just don't. So to use that thing of, "[Oh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1617s) yes, it's a personal choice," no one's going to go against it. No one's going to go against those directions because then they know full well what will happen if they do.

And it's coming back to the point about you were saying, Jacky, about going and seeing in-laws and things like that. And you just you look at all things like the travel bans and the special meetings that are arranged for this time of year, you just go, where [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1648s) the logic? There's no logic to saying someone who, you know, we know they lead very busy lives in terms of work and everything. So this time of year has got to be an opportunity for, especially for people like you say, people who have family the other end of the country. It's got to be an ideal opportunity to go away, right, let's go and spend some time with family because it might be the grandparents don't see the grandkids very often [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1678s) whatever it is.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1679s)

They don't, do they? Even at not Christmas, you're not really meant to go.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1685s)

No, but that's what I mean. But it brings up the question, where is the logic in it, whether it's Christmas or not? But where is the logic in there? But this time of year has got to be an opportunity for that to happen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1698s)

I mean, bearing in mind the days in between Christmas and New Year, most businesses shut down or run on skeleton staff. For those two or three days, as you say, I think if people have got their own businesses, they may use that. But when you've got that time where you could legitimately shut things down for two or three days and go and see family and just spend some time with them, I don't know.

There is no logic. When you actually break it down, you're right, Gilli, there's [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1728s) rational reason for it. Where is it said that you can't go and see your family at Christmas, anywhere biblically? I mean, I don't profess to know my Bible that well, but I don't think there's anything in the Bible that says anything like that. And logically, it just makes no sense, does it? So that must be about the control element.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1749s)

Yeah, and that comes back to the work thing as well. Because I remember, I mean, I've just celebrated 11 years so I'm a little bit out of date, but I can remember before I left, as an employee, the pressure definitely in that last couple of years, the pressure was definitely there to go into work between Christmas and New Year.

And you know, it was pointless because I was in sales, none of my customers were in work. Yes, there was probably minimal stuff I could catch up on, but the pressure was there to do it. And again, because they wanted us to be distracted with something that meant that we weren't doing something to enjoy yourself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1797s)

Going and visiting your family, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1801s)

I was talking to Bruce's, so Bruce's grandpa's brother is the relative that's out, and they actually celebrated Christmas up until they left in 1960\. Like, Brethren actually did celebrate Christmas back then. I wonder what changed? So I said like, what was your first Christmas like? He was like, "It's just normal because we did anyway. Everyone did." Does anyone know about any like new rulings back then or?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1836s)

I mean, I don't remember any ruling about, I don't remember ever celebrating Christmas and I'm considerably older than you and I don't remember any ruling. It must be sometime in the 60s that something was said about it if they did used to celebrate it or used to use it in a normal way to spend time with family or whatever. I don't know why that changed.

No, but there's many meetings per week, so that comes down to sort of what's been discussed before on the podcast, how things have changed over the last 40-50 years and it's morphed into something that [completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1882s) controls a person's life rather than something that should be, if you like, an enjoyable faith that you choose to do.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1891s)

Now, like the latest Sydney Levitical meeting, Bruce Hales said that if anyone wants to bring their matters out, he can personally guarantee that they won't be shut up or withdrawn from. What the hell? He doesn't want to lose anybody, does he? No, he literally was begging. I've heard from insiders that he was literally begging for people not to leave and it's like the one true [position.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1921s)

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1922s)

He's absolutely shitting himself because he knows there's no unrest in there and he's worried about his revenue stream, basically.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1930s)

Yeah, and he knows it's all coming crashing down around his head. Like one insider that I spoke to said that no one's listening to the rules anyway in locality. All this no travel stuff over Christmas, they're just cracking on and doing what they want. Good for them\! Enjoy it guys, put your Christmas trees up\!

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1952s)

On your lights\!

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1953s)

Yeah, I was like, wow. I doubt they do that in Coventry because Coventry's not like that, but yeah, I was like, that's like, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1964s)

And that's almost, I mean, this comes on to something else I was thinking about. You know, we're about to start a new year and these podcasts have been going over a year now, plus a lot of other action. What change do we hope to create in the next year or so?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=1985s)

Just more of the same. The impact the podcasts are having literally must give Bruce Hales sleepless nights every night. I think that's why two of his Levitical meetings were only half an hour long. Because can you imagine your whole empire crumbling?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2003s)

Yeah, well other dictators have had it happen.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2007s)

More of the same, I think. I hope that we see more leavers and hear more people's stories. And hopefully people that have been out a while will be able to become courageous enough to tell their stories as well, because so many people are still living in some kind of fear and haven't managed to overcome that to tell their stories. But they're so important, so important. So yeah, that's what I have to say about that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2048s)

What do you hope for, Ross?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2052s)

So I'm going to get really current. Obviously I'm going through quite a difficult patch at the moment and the last thing my mum said to me before I left was, "If you ever need help, just contact us and we'll do what we can." I duly do, as you know Jacky, and the answer I got was, "Oh well, if you come back, you know, you'll have all the help you can get."

I suppose the change that I'd like to see is that, okay, you might not want to speak to us regularly, but at least when we do need help, please, please do help us. You know, we're still, we're still your children.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2097s)

And I think that helped, you summed it up there, Ross. Help isn't kind if it's not given unconditionally. If it's given conditionally, it's not true help, is it? It's, "Well, I'll let you have what you need, but there's a but to it." And that's exactly what you said when you did mention to your mum that you may need help and it was the sort of, "Of course we'll help you, but..."

And you think, well, you're putting conditions on that help. You're not just [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2127s) what you need. And I think that's something I'd like to get across to the Brethren. I know they claim to be compassionate and kind and all of those things, but conditional help is not help. It's not true, kind help. So it has to be unconditional.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2143s)

And it literally says in the video of Deed of Variation, "reasonable assistance should be given." That means just, you know, after you've literally just left, from what I take is, you know, is every assistance should be given when needed, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2161s)

Yeah, I mean, it's the word "reasonable," isn't it? That can be, what is reasonable? And unfortunately, I think their perhaps perception of reasonable might be different to ours when it suits them. But my big thing is the conditional help. "Yes, we will help you, but you sign this piece of paper, you come back to us, you don't have anything to do with it." You know, there's a condition attached and that's when help is not help, it becomes a burden.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2188s)

Yeah, "You come back to us and forget all about the gay nonsense," basically.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2192s)

Yes, I think they were the actual words, weren't they Ross? Very hurtful. Really? Yeah, they were the actual words. That was awful. How awful. Yeah, very sad.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2206s)

Yeah. But you know, you've got to kind of have some form of, is it empathy? I don't know, towards them. They're so, yeah, I don't know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2218s)

I don't blame my mum, she's been in it all her life, so she didn't only do...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2221s)

No idea. And even I didn't have any idea of what the whole, you know, gay thing was. Now my best friends are lesbians.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2233s)

I think we said that at the time, didn't we Ross? It's although it was a comment that was a bit, whoo\! You kind of have to take it from somebody who probably believed what they were saying, because that's what they've been told all their life. And if you've been told something all your life, you probably will believe it repeatedly.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2257s)

Yeah. What about you, Gilli? What would you like to change in the Brethren?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2263s)

I think, yeah, obviously there's obviously the big thing that everybody's referred to in terms of family contact, that kind of thing. But I think there's, I think we said throughout the year, haven't we, that this isn't just about, we're not here to try and take down their whole system. You know, everyone's entitled to their beliefs. Everyone's entitled to what they want to believe. Yes. Obviously if it starts cutting across legal boundaries, that's slightly different, that's slightly worrying. But I think the big thing for me is...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2301s)

The whole thing, because the whole thing does that. The whole thing is a human rights violation.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2308s)

Yeah, yes, yes, obviously there are elements. But then you could, you know, as far as everybody, you could walk into any church across the country and somebody will have a different belief to what you, you know, even between the four of us sat here, there'll be different beliefs amongst us all.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2331s)

That doesn't stop us getting on.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2334s)

No, that's exactly what I mean. It's that kind of thing of, I can think of the very few times I have had conversations with family over the 11 years I've been here. And it's never a normal conversation. It's always a very stiff upper lip. There's no humor to it, you know, there's no, you know, the way that, just personally as a family, me and my brother used to give each other stick all the time. That was our sense of humor, but that's all dead and gone. You know, there's nothing of that, which yeah, obviously comes back to the family side of things.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2384s)

And also I suppose, you know, it's always us to contact them, they never get in contact with us.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2392s)

Yeah. Yeah, but I think for me personally, what I would love to see is, if that's the way you want to believe, so be it. I think there's a lot more, like we've just referred to your situation, Ross, there should be a lot more tolerance in their beliefs and in the way they go about things.

But also allowing people to live, allowing people to live their lives in terms of, you know, whether it's hobbies, holidays, you know. And it [comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2436s) back to the question of you asked earlier, what are they actually afraid of here? You know, if someone wanted to take up a hobby, say, I don't know, say a winter sport, so if wanted to take up skiing, you know, from a, if you look at it from a PBCC point of view, you're out in God's creation, you're enjoying nature.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2463s)

Healthy exercise.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2466s)

Healthy exercise, you keep, you know, where's the harm?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2469s)

If you start letting people do that kind of thing, that's when they start to lose their grip on people and that's yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2477s)

Yeah, of course, of course we know that. But in terms of what we would like to see, you know, there's so many harmless hobbies that people can take up, which ultimately would end up improving mental health, you know, getting out and clearing your head, getting away from the rat race of PBCC life. We all know how hectic it is, and just allowing that...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2518s)

Straight to the meeting.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2521s)

I think that goes back to the point, Gilli. You know, if you were allowed to do those things, they keep you busy so that you can't think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2531s)

Which is a cult tactic. It's totally, yeah, it's the control tactic. And I think you've summed it up. I mean, the change I would like to see, it's very much what I'd like to say to the Brethren in there. You're allowed, we said it before, you're allowed your beliefs. You're allowed not to eat and drink with people if you so wish, but don't hurt people.

And also see why you're being controlled. I would like to say to people in there, look at the reasons why you're being controlled. What is it achieving? Because all you're told is you're living a life like this on earth so that you have a better life in heaven after you die. I mean, that's, it's the afterlife that they're concerned about, isn't it? Their life in heaven.

Well, if I'm quite frank, none of us know exactly what's going to happen when we die. So my attitude is you have this one life [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2587s) here on earth, so you might as well enjoy it. And by that, I don't mean doing things that are wrong. But the biggest gift you can give somebody is to allow them to truly be themselves. And I think that's what's denied every member of the Brethren.

It happens outside too, coercion happens outside, but that's what happens to every member of the Brethren. I think when I was in, and I'm sure it's the same for you three, you're not allowed to even think about who you are and what you enjoy in life. And you know, I mean, [Ross,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2618s) you're a very classic example because you were gay, but you're not even allowed to believe at first that you're gay because that doesn't happen in the Brethren.

As Gilli said, some people may love sport, but they're not allowed to pursue sports, are they, and enjoy that. So I think the biggest gift you can give somebody is to allow them to truly be themselves. And what I want to say to the Brethren, just take a good long, hard look. Why are you doing what you do? What are you achieving? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2648s) I don't think it's got anything to do with faith. And you just want to stop saying, what is it achieving? All the meetings, all the entertaining, the stress, the money, you know, everything, what is it achieving?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2665s)

And it's a very, it's a very good point because that you just mentioned about not being anything to do with faith. And I personally don't have much of a faith anymore, but you look at people you come across in your life who have a very strong theological grounding, and you compare it to people in the PBCC and there is just...

And I, you know, you look back on your own life in the PBCC and you look back at, and I think we've referred to it before, but everything that you're doing is to impress or to fall in line. There is virtually no part of their lives that they're actually, it is truly about faith. The majority of it is just about falling in line and toeing the line and you know, seeing who you can impress in the meantime.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2728s)

Yeah, I agree. And even, I haven't been to a meeting for many, many years, but I understand even in the meetings, there's no meaningful understanding of scripture or preaching of the gospel that you might get in a mainstream church where somebody is actually trying to explain what the scripture means and trying to get you to understand and trying to give you a sort of moral message.

There's none of that as I understand it. I mean, Abi, you've been to meetings more recently than me, but even in my day, a lot of the meeting was about Mr. Symington and how our brother is laying down his life for us and we really should be ashamed of the way we've behaved because of what he's having to do. And I don't think that's particularly changed, just the leader's changed.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2774s)

No. I can remember on the odd occasions when we would have outsiders come into a meeting and whoever was preaching would be told to make no mention of Mr. Hales in their preaching. And there were often times when you could see someone visually struggling to actually deliver what you would class as a normal preaching because the one thing they normally talked about, they weren't allowed to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2815s)

They had to actually do a proper sermon.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2818s)

Yeah, didn't know what to do. No, exactly. And it's like you're saying, coming back to the point about actually having a solid, you know, anybody in there actually having a sort of a reasonable grounding on the subject of faith. When I first left, I did keep my faith for a while and I did go to church.

And I remember asking the vicar at the church I was at, and I explained [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2848s) him, "Look, this is what I've been brought up with in terms of my beliefs about Christmas." And you know, in the Brethren, we were told that we didn't celebrate Christmas because there was no reference in the Bible about when Christ was born, etc. And he just sat down with me and just went through it.

It was really interesting to hear from a theological point of view. He said, "Look, yes, there is no definitive proof or historical proof that Jesus was born on the 25th of December. However, he wasn't on one census, but he was on the next one. So we know that he was born in a certain time frame. The 25th has probably just been something that's just developed over history and has become the tradition."

And it's just that kind of thing, it's that kind of attitude of looking, actually studying it and taking time to study it. There's none of that. It's all just because, right, we're told that there's no proof that Christ was born on the 25th of December, so that's it, we'll just accept it.

And the same sort of, I can remember talking to him about various things that were obviously being drummed into me as a kid. And I can remember saying to him about, you know, "Sorry for asking questions," and he just straight away just snapped back at me, but just came back at me straight away and went, "If you don't ask questions, you'll never [know."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2935s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2938s)

But you see how different, I'll just gonna say, what a contrast. What a contrast where we know people have openly been withdrawn from for asking questions. You know, the ex-members, "Well, I asked too many questions and next thing I knew, I'd lost everything."

And I think that's the main thing. You know, the Brethren are full, in my opinion, most of the Brethren are lovely people. Yes, there's some people in there that aren't very nice, but that's human life. You know, wherever you go, there's people that are nice and not very nice. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2969s) they're relevant to the next year, just stop and take a good long, hard look and think, "Why am I doing this?"

And I don't really care how old or young you are, there's always tomorrow. I think it's very hard for people like your mother, Ross, who's obviously spent all of her life in there. You can't expect somebody to change. But I think [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=2999s) is if the softening came from the top, this is where I do hold the leader responsible. It's like in any business, what's at the top filters down.

And if the softening came from the top, I think people like Ross's mother, your parents Gilli, my brother would feel they could contact family that are out without fear of repercussions. And that's what is needed. So that would be my change. I think [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3029s) could be people within, like as Abi said, there was one meeting where they all seem to be doing their own thing at Christmas and good for them, whereas other meetings maybe are more strict. But if the softening comes from the top, then it will filter through and that's what you hope for, isn't it?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3046s)

Yeah, and I think there's a rebellion from the bottom either or. Yeah, but I think that we've seen proof of that, you know, and we've referred to the Deed of Variation. You know, obviously that was put out that the Brethren should be made to be, should be able to keep in contact with their family.

Ross referred to the point about physical help being offered. I can remember that being, I can remember quoting that to my brother about physical help being offered and things like that and his response was, "Oh, you've misunderstood it." It's just like, how have I misunderstood it? It's there in black and white.

That Deed of Variation is now just about 10 years old. It was January 2014\. I remember when that was agreed in the hope to save the Brethren going to the High Court to decide about their charitable status and basically probably having a lot of things with dirty washing aired down in the High Court, I think. What's changed?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3125s)

I think my personal opinion of what's changed is they've got complacent. Because I've personally seen an extract of their ministry from Bruce Hales that has clearly stated that nobody inside should be having any contact with anyone who's left. And that is a direct contrast to what the Deed of Variation agrees.

But in my opinion, the issue is it's been there, the Deed of Variation has been there so long that they've just got complacent with it. There's very few people who are, as much as we try and actively challenge it, we're kind of up against a juggernaut, if you like.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3189s)

And the fact of the matter is as well, is that the main rank and file of the Brethren in there don't actually really know what's in the Deed of Variation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3198s)

I agree, Ross. They don't even understand its existence or the meaning of it. It's not been transparent in the Brethren. And certainly people I've spoken to in the Brethren who are not happy in there and I've mentioned to it over the last 10 years have all said, "What on earth is that?" So they don't know, which in itself is a breach of the Deed of Variation because it's the trustee's responsibility to make sure the members of the congregation are aware of the deeds that each trust are bound by and the behaviour they're supposed to exhibit.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3235s)

And I know personally, from my personal experience, I know that, I mean, I think the agreement actually states every person over the age of 18 is supposed to have a copy, is that right? Something like that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3252s)

It's supposed to be, I think the wording, I'd have to double check, but I believe the wording is "made available." So I think if anybody asks the trustees for it, they're duty bound to give it to that person. But I don't think anybody in the Brethren thinks to ask for it because they don't really understand.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3269s)

I challenged my parents about it and they admitted that at the time that it was issued, it was read out in the meeting, a copy was given to each household, not to each person over 18, just to each household, and they were made to hand it back once they'd read it. Now, just from a, like you said, it's 10 years on, how is anyone supposed to remember a document of that length 10 years on?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3300s)

And they wouldn't have time to digest it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3306s)

I mean the actual Deed of Variation is a few pages, but the whole document, the report, is 55 pages long, so you kind of need to read it several times in order to digest and understand what it's all about.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3320s)

But also if anybody who's left the Brethren, if anybody's challenging it with their respective relatives, how are they supposed to know what's said if they don't have access to it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3338s)

Yeah, yeah. I did once challenge it. I challenged it with the trustees of the meeting where my brother is local, not because my brother didn't have contact with me, I can live with that. It was because he never contacted my mother and I challenged it. And it was an uphill battle because it somehow got turned around that he wouldn't have contact with me because obviously I'm an opposer and it's his choice not to because I'm an opposer.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3369s) I came away from the meeting thinking, "But hang on a minute, that's not the reason I'm challenging it. I'm challenging it because my mother has never spoken publicly about the Brethren. She's never, why can't he just phone up and see, 'Hey mum, how are you?'" That's why I challenged it, but the whole point was missed and it was kind of twisted.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3399s)

No, I was going off on a bit of a tangent. I was gonna go back to what you were saying about the softening from the top and linking it into how one meeting will do something like all the brothers are having, celebrating Christmas and going away, whereas another meeting won't. If the softening came from the top, it would actually have a more even effect throughout the different localities as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3425s)

Yes it would, yes. It wouldn't be sort of a little rebellion somewhere that then perhaps extends, perhaps gets clamped down, perhaps extends.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3433s)

Yeah, so that comes back to the point that we were making about them being told not to talk to us. The exact same would work the other way if they were all told, and we know what happened in 2003, they're all told to make contact with relatives who have been out for however long.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3450s)

They did, and they did.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3452s)

So yeah, to link it to your point Ross, yeah, it came from the top. And if it did, we wouldn't be having these conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3463s)

Yeah, we wouldn't. And if it did, I mean, you also wonder about Bruce Hales. What is his end game? Because we know the man is extremely wealthy. He's probably trying to enjoy that wealth, so we don't know. There's lots of rumours about him going on holidays. We don't know really what he gets up to, do we? We haven't got the actual hard evidence of what he does when he disappears.

So what is his end game? How does he see it carrying on? I almost want to say to him, "For goodness sake, Bruce, just give up. You've got everything. Nobody wants to take your money, but stop taking money off my family to get more money." That's what I want to say. "You've got enough, and tell my family and tell everybody's family that it's okay to chat, it's okay to say hello, it's okay to be friends." Because if that happened, the whole thing would change.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3515s)

But that absolutely comes from the top, but that also applies to individuals. I've had this conversation, you know, like I say, I rarely get to talk to my parents, but I do remember one conversation with them and it was about something that had happened within the family. I think a sibling of mine had got engaged or married or something and I'd specifically asked if anything had happened in the family.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3546s) my mum didn't tell me and I found out via someone else a couple of days later. So I phoned my parents back and I had the conversation with them and I just said to them at the time, and I think I would say this to anyone inside, "What do you think we're going to do with this information? Seriously, there's three households with our surname in the Brethren. Who in the billions of people in the outside world are going to be interested in, gives a monkey's that your cousin got engaged?"

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3578s)

You're interested because it's your family, but it's not headline news.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3584s)

What are we going to do with this information? Yes, why are you withholding it? It's absolutely, like you say, it's no interest to anyone else, but to us it means a lot more.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3598s)

Yes, and it's like my oldest brother had a brain aneurysm and I wasn't told until about 18 months after. And that was only through me phoning my mum and saying, "How is my oldest brother?" and that's when she told me. And it's slightly scarily, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3620s)

And yet by contrast...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3621s)

Information, you know, who gives a toss that my brother had a brain aneurysm out here, you know, it's nothing to them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3631s)

But to you, yeah, he's your brother. However, whether you did or didn't get on with him, he's your brother and you'd want to know if he was critically ill. And by contrast, my brother who's out of the Brethren was also critically ill 11 years ago and the first thing we did was tell my brother in the Brethren because he had a right to know.

And that actually broke down a huge amount of barriers. And this is what I mean about when I say family are hesitant, they'll get too close. My brother spoke to me an awful lot during that [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3662s) because my middle brother was, that banter we used to have when we were teenagers growing up came back and it was almost like we were friends and we had some very familiar conversations that were lovely. And I think that might have scared him, you know, because he thinks, "Hang on a minute, she hasn't changed, so mum hasn't changed."

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3683s)

No, I think it does scare them to be honest.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3685s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3687s)

I think it comes back to the point about people, we've spoken about people who are innocent in all of this. And I personally think about it from, you know, I've got three sons. What have they done to deserve not having to do with their grandparents?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3711s)

Absolutely nothing.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3713s)

And I could almost guarantee that if I asked my parents, they probably couldn't even remember their birthdays. But what have my three sons done? Yeah, you might regard me, you know, you can regard me as evil, regard me as whatever you want. I don't agree with your assessment of me, but where's three innocent kids?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3742s)

Your three kids could hardly be classed as opposers because they probably don't even know who the Brethren are at this... Absolutely not.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3750s)

Yeah. But you know, we know there's so many people in that situation. Be it partners, you know, if you've got a partner who's never had anything to do with the Brethren, they're innocent. Why are they evil?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3775s)

Yeah, why are they evil just because they happen to be the partner of somebody who left the Brethren? Yeah. And they're not at all. And if they actually sat and thought about it logically, I think a lot of them would see that. But it's that, you can almost remember it when you're in that fear, because once you start to think like that, that's when you're on the slippery slope.

It's not a slippery slope, it's a great slope, but it's a bit of a bumpy ride at times. But yeah, just a bit bumpy at times. But that's when you're on the sort of doubt of, okay, should I be here? So Ross, was there anything else you wanted to say to anybody inside on this subject of change?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3821s)

Not on the subject of change, but I would just like to say to my nephews that I'm out here and if you ever decided to leave, I'm here and you can just knock on my door. There'll be no judgment. I'm here waiting, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3838s)

And knowing Ross, he'll give you the biggest hug ever. And that's what you want to say is that you've got, you know, we're not hard-hearted, we're kind-hearted, we're here to help.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3852s)

Definitely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3853s)

Yeah, and don't fear.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3855s)

Yeah, and also our help is unconditional.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3858s)

Yeah, we don't want anything in return. What about you, Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3868s)

I think it would be the same. I've always personally said I will never push anyone to leave the Brethren, but if someone does reach out, then I will do whatever it takes to help out. And I genuinely mean that. If it means driving the length of the country, I'll do it. Because I think we've all experienced the desperation of wanting to leave. And we know that it's very difficult, but you won't get judgment for whatever it is.

We all, everybody has ups and downs in life. Everybody makes mistakes.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3922s)

That's okay.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3923s)

That's okay. That's life. Everyone deals with the things differently. Everyone handles things differently. Everyone has different opinions. It's okay, you're not going to get into trouble for it. And I think if anybody on the inside, if there's one thing I would say is if you want to do something, if you have an urge to do something, do it. If you want to reach out to a relative that's outside, do it. Because I can guarantee you 90% of the time you're not going to get a negative reaction.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3965s)

What about you, Jacky? Have you got anything you'd like to say to your family?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=3970s)

I think I'd like to say to my brother, "Please, please pick up the phone, talk to your parents." You know, they're 85 now. They're both fine, but I think if anything happened to them, he will live with regrets. He will have the regret of 40 wasted years and I want to say it's not too late. They're still here, they'd love to hear from you.

And I think I'd reiterate exactly what you two have said. If [anybody](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4000s) wants to contact the contact numbers from the Get A Life podcast, the info at Get A Life, the Olive Leaf Network. There's the Family Survival Trust in the UK that helps people trying to leave controlling groups. Look at the links. There's a lot of help there or contact any of us and we'll do what we can.

But I think from a change point of view, a rebellion from the bottom would be good, but softening from the top, I think would... I want to say to Bruce, "You've got nothing to lose, mate, now. You've got your money, you've got nothing to lose. So let it go, take the pressure off, let it go and let us have our families back." And I think that would be my message, very much so.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=4047s)

So a rebellion from the bottom would cause a lot of destruction, but if the softening came from the top, yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=4057s)

I think you just hit the nail on the head, Jacky, one expression you just used then, do not let anything, do not hold anything that you're going to regret.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSZTQ2WH8Y&t=4069s)

Yeah absolutely. Well thank you both of you, we seem to have lost Abi on the way but it was nice to have her with us on the start of the podcast. And all is to say is a very happy new year to both of you. Enjoy. Thank you. Happy new year.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
