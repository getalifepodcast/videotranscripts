## Summary

Left alone with her brother on the ferry ride to Victoria, our guest Julie Fletcher describes growing up in Vancouver, Canada.  After arriving in Victoria, Julie was told she would be going home with the Buck family.  For the next 2 years, she describes being separated from her parents, her brother (later on), and from everything she knew.  It was never explained to her - what happened on the ferry that day that caused her parents to turn around and go back and she would spend the next 2 years wondering.  When her mother returned to the meeting two years later- it was without her father, and Julie describes growing up in a PBCC “broken family”.
Julie also shares her recent experience losing her young daughter, Haven, to a very aggressive, invasive cancer.  We are so proud that Julie spoke out to help others understand how destructive the hierarchy is inside the PBCC.  When you would expect compassion and fatherly love, she received judgment and disdain.  How has that affected her, and what scars does she carry?

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith, and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression, and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5eDqAds_IlI%26t%3D71s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today with Carman and a very special guest, Julie Fletcher.

Julie was also in the Brethren, the Exclusive Brethren, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and like most ex-members, still suffers and has the roller coaster effect that we all do. I'm going to hand the mic over to Julie and let her tell her story and what she has been through post-leaving the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

So welcome Julie. We are very, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=113s) blessed to have you come on to our podcast and share your story. I know your story is going to send ripple effects, not only through the ex-member community, but inside there. It is a story that I know you are such a wholeheartedly wear-your-heart-on-the-sleeve kind of person that when we have those types of guests on here, we all feel it.

The ex-brethren community has been very much holding space for you as you have gone through horrific tragedy recently. And I just want you to know that we are holding space for you on here for you to be able to share what you're willing to share. So I'm going to hand the mic over to you.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=163s)

Well, thank you, Cheryl. I feel privileged to be joining you and Carman, too. And it's nice to have a commonality with each other. I was born in Vancouver. My grandparents, my dad's parents, had moved to Canada in 1956\. So that was a huge move for my family.

My brother Anthony, he was five, was killed in a car accident in Vancouver, and my mother was pregnant with me at the time. A little bit about that, I think it was a Friday night and my mother and Anthony were going to stay home from meeting, and then at the last minute, Anthony decided to go to meeting with my father. He just said, "Bye Mom," and he went off. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=220s) on the way home, my dad stopped on Southeast Marine Drive, it's like an elevated, slanted road, and he stopped to get a newspaper, left my two brothers in the car.

The car rolled. My younger brother Bob, well he's older than me, but the younger of the two, pulled it down into neutral and the car rolled down towards a bridge, and a truck coming off the [bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=250s) or heading east hit my dad's vehicle broadside and Anthony was thrown through the windshield.

My mom was wondering what happened and where they were because they hadn't come home yet. Then the police showed up at the house and said, "Well, you're needed at the hospital." So she called my grandmother and had my grandmother meet her at the hospital. She told me that they'd asked to see my brothers and they weren't allowed to, and we don't know exactly why.

So I come out into the world six months later, born into all this grief and misery and pain and all sorts of stuff. My mother was just never able to form a bond with me because she had just shut down. So that affected my life right [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=304s) the bat.

My parents would always fight and argue and shout at each other. We were never allowed to have brethren over to our home because our home was, in my dad's eyes, never good enough. So that made us sort of marginalized already. He would get angry with my mother for not doing anything during the day, which wasn't true, he just didn't see it. So that played a huge role in my brother's and my life.

I remember one time I was down in the basement with my brother, and my dad had come in the house and was shouting at my mother. My brother and I said, "We got to do something about this. It can't keep going on like this." We went up the stairs and we just shouted at the two of them, "You two need to cut [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=365s) out right now." And that was kind of like the end of that.

By the time I was nine, we came to Victoria. I didn't know what had happened, but I found out after I left what happened. I was left on the ferry with the brethren and my parents decided to go home. I just [walked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=395s) off the ferry, got on the bus, went to the meeting room, sat down, and I remember thinking to myself walking off the ferry, "Where are my parents? I can't find my parents." I hadn't seen them. I don't know if anybody else had, but nobody said anything to me. I hadn't even seen my brother. Nobody had sat down with me and talked to me about what was happening. I had no idea.

It was just always a major issue [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=425s) me. I just sat down in the meeting room and John Boram came up to me and just said, "You're going to the Bucks' house," which is another family in the brethren. I don't even remember getting off the ferry, coming home, or going to the Bucks' house that night. Anything, it's just like a blur. But I was there at the Bucks' house for like two years and I had no contact with my mother. I couldn't write to her, talk to her, see her, gather any of my [own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=455s) belongings, nothing.

I remember one time I was walking to school when I was living at the Bucks' house and I crossed a main street, which is a very busy road in Vancouver. It has a huge land divider of grass, so I would cross one side and then stop on this big huge land divider and wait to cross on the other side. My brother had gone to live back with my mother because he couldn't handle being with [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=485s) Bucks. So my mom had dropped him off at school and on her way back, she saw me. She was just panicking and said, "No, I gotta let you, I gotta cross with you." I was very adamant that she not do that.

But she helped me cross and I went off to school. I continued living with the Bucks, and then when she got her separation from my father and ultimately her divorce, then she came back to meeting. I remember her coming into meeting, sitting down beside me and pinching my butt. I didn't understand why, you know, like that's a nice, "Hi, how are you? Wow, great to see you." [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=534s) anyways, my relationship was even more strained after that.

It's never been a great relationship, but it just was even far worse. We moved to Richmond and we lived in my cousin Nairn McHaffie’s house. A lot of brethren don't know that Alan and Stewart are my mother's second cousins. Their grandmother and my great-grandfather are siblings. That's how we're related. But we always called Stewart and Alan like uncle and aunt.

So we lived in Nairn's house and then eventually my mom and I and my brother all ended up working for Jason, which is Nairn's older brother. Eventually, we were able to buy a house that used to belong to first David and Yvonne Boram, and then Steve and Glenis Todd. But in order for my mom to be able to afford it, we had to move it forward on the property. Then Doreen Bellamy bought the property between us and David and Yvonne. And so there was our house, Doreen's house, Dave and Yvonne's house, and a small meeting room. [So.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=624s) We lived there until I left the brethren, which was in 2000\.

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

And how old were you when you left? 

**Julie Fletcher**

Twenty. Yeah. Stuff was always kind of rough, just little things that occurred I didn't like. First, my mom, we had this small fence that would kind of hide a shed that was behind, and it was just like the top of our driveway. I don't even know why it was there. Anyways, she wanted it painted and she would say, "Oh, I gotta get Bob to paint this." And I said to her, "You know, he's never gonna do it. He doesn't have time. And if you just get the paint, I'll do it."

So I painted it and then I decided [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=684s) would paint a little deck that we had off the side of our house. I never got any recognition, no thanks, nothing from my mother. Actually, my brother gave me a compliment which was shocking to me anyways because he was always kind of nasty towards me, not really wanting to get along.

So I guess the next thing that happened would be me leaving.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=723s)

What was that light bulb that made you know you needed to get out? Like, what was the driving factor?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=732s)

Well, I had this ongoing question floating around my head and I didn't understand where it was coming from. I remember telling my mother about it and she just said, "Oh, that's the devil." My question that was floating around my head was, "What if there's a church out there who preaches the truth and you miss the rapture [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=762s) you're in a church that doesn't preach the truth or whatever?" I really thought nothing of it to begin with, but because it never really left me, then I had to give it some credence, like, "Well, yeah, what if?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=777s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=778s)

So I don't know. And then just little things. I'd have to back up a bit. There had been a situation with David and Yvonne Boram's oldest son, Mark. He has mental health issues and he had called some family in Barbados because he had heard voices telling him that I needed to marry some guy in Barbados. I can't even remember his name. He believed it so much that he called the family and told them.

I got [wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=808s) of this, actually through Mark Todd. Mark Todd came and told me and he was like, "You know, Mark is telling Alice, my cousin Alice McHaffie, that you're supposed to marry some guy in Barbados." And I'm like, "What? That's weird." I don't even know this person. I've never been to Barbados, but apparently, he had stayed with this family, so he knew them.

I went home that night and told my mom about it and she [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=838s) believe me. She thought I was full of crap. I was like, "Oh well, you know, it all comes out in the wash in the end," her famous saying. A few nights later, Yvonne shows up at our house, knocking on the door. She actually asked my mom to go outside and talk to her. My mom came back in after 20 minutes and said nothing. I just said, "So what's all the hissy-hissy about?" "Oh, well, it has nothing to do with you." "Okay, excuse me."

So I said, "I'm gonna find out one way or the other." And sure enough, like maybe a day or two later, she's up talking to her sister in England, telling her sister about what had happened, that Mark had done this. So the parents found out about it and had to call the family back and say, "Sorry, you know, our son's mentally ill and just disregard that." But she never said, "You know, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=900s) so sorry for not believing you. I apologize. I should have just listened." Nothing. She never even talked about it.

Just a lot of little things. I just was tired of the way we were being treated. I felt like we were marginalized, minimized, we were nobodies. I felt like I was being targeted because I came from a broken home. Uncle Al was kind of leading at the time and I sat behind him often on a Saturday. He called me after the meeting and said, "Why weren't you at meeting?" And I mean, he wasn't nasty about it, but I said, "Yeah, I was at meeting. I sit behind you." Remember, this was like a common conversation he and I would have. And he's like, "Well, I didn't see you." And I'm like, "Yeah, because I'm sitting behind you."

So of course you're not going to see me. But I'm like, "Did you call up like Stephen and Glenis and find out why Tawny wasn't there? Or like Graham and Carol and find out why Marianne wasn't there?" I don't think so. You're just targeting us because I come from a broken home and I happen to be like a family member.

It was just frustrating to me to be targeted all the time. I felt mistreated when the brethren took all of us out of public school and put us into this distance learning program they had, like their study hall. I would complete my school work the way it was supposed to be completed, but of course, it took longer. All the other kids would just do their send-in papers, which meant they did it faster. So they would haul me aside and, "Julie, why don't you do this, this, and this?" I'm like, "I'm doing it the way I'm supposed to. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1012s) you're talking too much." I'm like, "No, they're talking too much. I do my schoolwork." I mean, I was behind, but I was doing it the correct way.

Just little things, it just irritated me. So I just had enough, frankly. I just had enough. And so, I don't know, out of the blue, I decided to jump out my window at one o'clock in the morning and take off.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1036s)

Wow. Yeah. And did you have a plan? Did you have a plan or it was just... Wow, good for you.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1043s)

No, no plan. Well, I shouldn't say I had no plan. I had some sort of a plan, but it was running away to somebody's house that I really didn't know, like a worldly man's house. My plan wasn't really planned out well, because when I got the taxi... so initially I jumped out my room, took off, I hid at a telephone booth.

Then I decided to walk up the main drag from our house, like the main street where our house came off of. I went into a Mac's store, which is like a 7-Eleven type store, and I asked to use the telephone book. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1087s) I don't think they had one or maybe they did, I can't remember, but somehow I managed to get a taxi. I asked the taxi to take me all the way out to Guildford in Surrey, which is a mall.

He said, "I can't drop you off at the mall because it's closed now. So where am I going to take you?" And I said, "Well, I don't know. I don't have a phone to use. I don't know how to get ahold of Ray." And he's like, "Well, here, you can use my cell phone." So I tried getting ahold of Ray and he didn't answer, but eventually he did. So he ended up dropping me off at Ray's house and I stayed there.

Then the process of looking for my grandfather began because I had [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1133s) met my grandfather, my father's dad. So I got out the phone book and looked through all the Frank Fletchers. I was like, "Okay, I'm just gonna have to call every single one of them." I had no idea where he lived. I'm like, "Well, I need to come up with a question I'm gonna ask to narrow my search down," which was like, "Do you have a daughter named Susie?" So literally called them all, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1167s) my grandfather was the very last one.

Wow. Yeah. So it was pretty amazing to meet up with him. The minute he saw me, he's like, "You look like Audrey. You look so much like Audrey," like my grandmother. And I said, "Yes, yes, I do." I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I mean, she's dear to me.

Yeah, just instantaneous. I felt right at home. That was my grandpa. Unfortunately, he was involved in another cult and I was totally not aware of that. He's like, "Well, you can't stay here at Ray's house because you know," he's so still very brethren in his thinking, "that's [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1218s) know, living in sin. You can't live like that. That's not okay. So you're coming to live with me." So here I am and I'm like, "Well, at least, you know, leave some money for Ray," because he didn't harm me, he didn't hurt me, he treated me okay.

So I went off to my grandfather's house and lived with him. I went to college and I worked and ended up going to church with him. Well, he really talked me into it because I really didn't want to, because of all the things that brethren have always told us, you know, like, "Well, you know, they live double standards. They go to church wearing dresses and then go home and wear pants." Actually, I found out maybe that's true, but they're actually more [genuine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1270s) Christian than the brethren are.

Yeah, but needless to say, they were a lot like the brethren. They wear dresses, they have long hair, they're not allowed to wear makeup or jewelry. They have to be in submission, so a lot of similarities. My grandfather would still have folks over to his home on a Sunday, occasionally, not every Sunday.

They had special meetings, and so I would go to special meetings with my grandfather. We drove all across the States, down to Tennessee and eventually to Georgia. Wow. That was awesome. That was an awesome adventure. And I was thinking, "You know, we're just gonna have the typical old story of a flat tire." No, no, no. Of course, we had a way more original story.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1333s) had a map and I had figured out which exit we needed to take. So I was looking for one that goes up over a bridge that goes up over the highway. My grandfather takes this right turn and it just goes sort of like down a country road with a cement barrier in between the lanes. I said, "Grandpa, we're totally going the wrong direction. This is not where we're supposed to be going." And he's like, "No, Julie, this is the way we're going and that's it." I'm like, "[Okay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1363s) sure, let's just see how long this lasts."

So we're just going along. He goes, "See, you see it's got a divided highway. It's got this concrete barrier in the center." "No, Grandpa, it doesn't mean like that, but you know, we're just going to carry on because you know what you're doing." So the barrier all of a sudden ends and out of nowhere he goes, "Julie, I think you're right. I think we went the wrong direction. How do we get back?" I'm like, "Oh my God, Grandpa, seriously? You just turn around and go back. It's not that hard."

So we turn around, we go back. I said, "Okay, get back onto the freeway. You have to carry on about a mile or so and you'll see the exit, exit 81 or whatever it was." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1415s) it should be like it goes up over the freeway because we need to go east. Sure enough, we found it and we got off, we got going, and we stopped in several places where there were message believers. That was interesting, staying at people's homes. There are so many similarities to that and the brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1442s)

So was this an offshoot of the brethren? Like, was this an offshoot of people that had left maybe at Aberdeen, or no?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1450s)

No, it's completely different. They're known as Branhamites or message believers. They believe that God sent a prophet, and he was preaching just after the war. He's sort of like a... he was very mixed up, shall we say. A lot of things that he told were plagiarized, made up, and just a bunch of crap, not even true.

He had started preaching in the Baptist church, and then because he believed in faith healing, he moved on to preach with Pentecostals. Then eventually he just went out on his own, preaching in tents, having tent revivals and that kind of stuff. A lot of their beliefs are based on this one so-called vision that he's seen that is not even true, never even happened.

Since leaving, you know, there's men and [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1527s) that have looked into things that he said, pointed out that he honestly was talking out of both sides of his mouth. One moment he was like, "Don't you believe me to be God's prophet?" and the next minute he's saying, "If I'm a false prophet, put the sign over my body and I'll wear it through town." Just all sorts of stuff.

So I didn't really want to get involved in church, but I ended up going with my grandfather. I ended up getting baptized because he was pushy about it. I would sleep in the hallways because I didn't understand what was being talked about. I didn't really understand William Branham or his ministry or what was being said. It was like listening to another language, so strange. Once I started reading the books that were put out, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1585s) I was like, "Oh, yeah, you know, this is the truth and I finally found the bride."

Wow. I mean, now I look back and say, "My gosh, my grandfather went from one brainwashing situation to another." Yeah. And it's so sad. It happens so often. I guess I'm just glad I got out, and I think it's because of me having my children.

William Branham's father was part of the KKK, so this influenced part of his ministry where he'd say, "You should never have mulatto children. You should never want to be in a mixed-race marriage," blah, blah, blah. That always irritated me because to me, I don't really see the problem with it. If you love who you love, exactly. It's only skin deep. We're all children of God at the end of the day.

But [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1645s) my children were biracial and because I had them out of wedlock, I was also no longer allowed to sing in the choir, I was no longer allowed to help out in the church. So I just quit going. I was working as a care aide at night prior to her being born, so I kind of just quit going because I was working and I didn't have the time.

Then she was born, I'd go visit and they would say nasty stuff to me. And just like, [well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1675s) I don't want to go. Then I found out there was a huge split in the church. I don't know exactly what year it was, but it would be about 10, 15 years ago, maybe not 15 but 10\. The pastor's daughter had been sexually assaulting her son's friend, and he was very young when this was happening.

I was just so [shocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1705s) because I had trusted her and had confidence in her and looked up to her, to find out that she'd been doing something that was actually criminal in my book. And she was allowed to continue playing the piano and conducting the choir and doing all these things. I'm like, "Really? You guys are so hypocritical. Why would you allow her who's committed a crime, a crime and should be behind prison or [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1735s) prison behind bars for this, and I am not allowed to sing or do anything? I'm just nobody now." It was just pure hypocrisy.

So I really wanted nothing to do with the church after that. I did, when I was in Grand Prairie, go to visit the church up there, but I really had nothing to do with it. I just said to my grandfather, "I'll never step foot in your church again," and I never did. I didn't even make it to his funeral, unfortunately. I couldn't afford to go over there.

Since leaving all of that, I've gotten myself into a domestic violence relationship. I remember thinking some part of that was normal, and then realizing it's not normal. It's only normal because I've been abused in the past, but it's not acceptable and I need to get out. I remember telling myself, "If you can leave the brethren, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1804s) you can leave this situation. The only difference is you have children now, and all the more reason to leave." It took me four tries to get out of that situation.

Then after that, I had a lot of health problems where my body actually attacked itself and has created this tunnel leading up to just above my pelvic floor, which needs to be repaired. I've had like umpteen surgeries, [MRIs,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1835s) CAT scans, this and that and the other. It's just ridiculous.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1843s)

Do you find that, like we often see this with female ex-brethren, that because in the brethren, the submission that a female has to go through and what they witness in their own parents, right, and witness in could be siblings that are married or witness right in there. Do you find when you left and you got yourself into a domestic violence situation, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1874s) your normal way of reacting, would you say that was because of what you had witnessed and gone through growing up?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1882s)

Yeah, probably. I just didn't want to... I realized I need to walk on eggshells, which is a very common theme with women that are in DV situations. They got to be very cautious and careful what they do and what they say and just everything. I do think it... I actually have attributed all of my situations with my kids' dads and any of the men that I've ever been with due to my non-relationship with my father and it not being a good role model for me.

Not having been told I was worth anything, not beautiful, not smart. No recognition, no acknowledgment, no love.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1941s)

And would you feel like you were viewed as just this object in the brethren versus a being that needed that love and that care and that compassion and the nurturing?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1954s)

I mean, I definitely remember thinking that I was simple-minded and then coming to the realization that actually I was perfectly normal. I was like, "Wow, why did I ever think that I was actually mentally incapable?" I don't know. I guess I do in a way feel like I was an object. I was just there. My parents are my parents, but they're not really parents, if that makes sense. I had no motherly relationship, no fatherly relationship, really at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=1995s)

I want to say to the viewers and listeners, we know that this stuff goes on everywhere in the outside world, but it's different when you're in a closed community. And that closed community is supposed to represent this tight-knit family that looks out for each other. You shouldn't have, like in your case, Julie, there should have been always someone being able to give you that nurture, the care, the compassion that you were needing if your parents couldn't. [Right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2025s)

So that's what I really want to... we do get that often of people saying, "Well, you know, this stuff goes on everywhere." We know that, but when you are a community that is set up and you're saying that this stuff doesn't happen in there and that everybody is taken care of, then in a situation like yours, Julie, there should have always been someone there that was ready to give you a hug, that was a listening ear, that was ready to just wrap you up in whatever you needed.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2053s)

Yeah, well, and be a mentor or somebody to look up to. You know, "This is how life should be and this is what you should expect from somebody of the opposite sex and what you don't accept."

You look back and you think about that ferry ride, and I think that's probably the point where you sort of feel like your whole life changed. [Definitely.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2083s) All of a sudden you are in Victoria and your parents, your brother's not there, nobody explains to you what's going on. The only thing you get told is you're going to go live with the Bucks.

Looking back, how do you in your mind resolve that situation? You've been jerked out of your parents' home, you've been placed in a different home, and like you say, it wasn't like a loving, nurturing environment. It's not [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2113s) you went and lived with grandparents who would obviously take over that role, or cousins, like relatives of my mother.

Again, that should have... I guess that was because they didn't know that Alan and Pearl or Stewart and Evelyn were relatives of my mom. But there's so many things that should have happened that didn't. They should have sat me down and told me what was happening, explained it to me. "This is what happened, there was an [occurrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2143s) downstairs with your parents." So how I've been able to resolve it is by going back and asking my parents, "Well, what in the world happened?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2153s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2153s)

That was one thing. So I had to get both of their versions because I knew they wouldn't be the same. For the most part they were, but there was a small portion where it was different. My dad said that my parents had told us that we needed to stay within eyesight, which was pretty normal. We usually did anyways. So all the brethren would sit in one area and my brother disappeared.

They couldn't find him, and when they realized they couldn't see him, my mom said to my dad, "Well, you [better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2184s) go find him." And my dad's like, "No, you better go find him." The typical argument starts. So they decide to go together and he's downstairs, the next floor down, watching people play arcade games. My dad just lost it. He grabbed him by his shirt and threw him up against the wall and just lost his temper. That embarrassed my mother, and so I guess this is why they decided to turn back.

My dad says they came back upstairs and saw Bill [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2214s) John talking and so approached them and asked them to take me and my brother. Whereas my mom said that Bill and John decided that we would be taken, which in my mind sounds more accurate because probably word got around. With them being the leaders, they decided amongst themselves that we weren't in a safe situation and we needed to be removed.

One thing I forgot to mention is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2244s) my brother and I were asked to write letters to our father saying that we didn't want to see him anymore. My letter was written for me and then I was just told to sign it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2256s)

Wow. How old would you have been?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2264s)

Twelve. And see, right there is the ultimate damage: turning a child against a parent. A 12-year-old child knows that she did not write that letter. And even your brother, forcing him to write it, I'm sure they coached him what to say because that's how that stuff worked. You have terminated that father-daughter, that father-son link.

And then once you've terminated it, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2294s) a normal church, you would step up and take responsibility to make sure that those people had that nurturing, that fatherly guiding. And from what you're saying, you never felt that again.

Yeah, there was... I mean, because of course, I guess normally we would have been with grandparents, but because my grandfather was out of the brethren since the 70s, we couldn't go live with my grandmother.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2323s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2324s)

Even though my great-grandfather was there, I think he was in a care home at that point. But yeah, you know, there's so many things that should have happened that didn't. When you think about it, if you think of a group of people, there's that scripture, "When one sheep out of a hundred goes off or is hurt or is lame or whatever, you drop the 99 and go take care of that one." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2354s) you look at a situation like yours, they should have been taking more care of you because you had more concerns, you needed more guidance, you needed that fatherly care.

This is the problem that I have with that whole system. It's arbitrary. It takes you out of your parents' home without even input from you and then destroyed that father-daughter, father-son link, [instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2385s) of trying to help it or repair it or take over and replace it. Nothing is done. And that's a huge issue to me.

Yeah. And I would say that it would be because of that. Like, my dad came to visit one time. I guess Bill and Liz knew that my dad was coming to visit or to see me, and so they had me busy doing stuff like unloading the dishwasher, doing a bunch of stuff in the kitchen until he arrived. By the time he got there, I just remember opening the door. I'm like, "Hi Dad, I don't want to talk to you." Boom, slammed the door.

So you know, I really didn't have anything to say because [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2434s) was our abuser. I was in a way grateful that he was gone. But that's so messed up. To not be allowed to have some sort of a relationship. And I think it's really affected me, well both of us, because I still don't have a relationship with my father. I really don't. But it's my choice now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2461s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2462s)

Yeah, but you can see how it's probably affected you all the way down. Getting into domestic violence, definitely. Studies show that is a product of not a proper father-daughter bond. Absolutely. There's just no doubt. You have to look back and say this is what really is the root cause of what has happened to you.

Absolutely, 100%. I know this is why [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2492s) was looking for love, acceptance, to belong in some way, and just looking for it in the wrong ways. I think we have been able to work on my ancestry, which has helped me find relatives and family that I never knew. Even family that used to be in the brethren and left, and I would never have known that until I found them.

I found a fourth cousin through my ancestry and he looks so much like my brother and I that we could be first cousins, not fourth cousins. The same big forehead, square jawline, and high cheekbone. Even wears glasses, likes photography and music like I do. He looks exactly like us, it's crazy.

Through him, I found second cousins once removed. So their grandfather and my great-grandfather were brothers. One of them actually sent me a picture of my great-great-grandparents I had never seen. So [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2569s) fun.

On my mom's side, my grandfather was born in the open brethren. I talked to Doug Engle, which he has like the Brethrenpedia, and he lists all the open brethren meetings and whatnot. I've had a few conversations with him and he did tell me who to talk to to try to find out more about my grandfather.

It's all very interesting. I did my DNA and we squashed a long-time story that ended up not being true. So I'm 52% Scottish and the rest is Viking, English and Viking. I told my Uncle Brian, my dad's brother, and he's like, "Yeah, well, don't you know your grandmother was a shieldmaiden?" I'm like, "You talk\!"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2634s)

No wonder you can persevere through all the crap that's been thrown at you.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2643s)

And then Haven was just like, wow. That's the icing on top of the cake, on the wrong side of the way, you know what I mean? The wrong way. Wow. It's... I know that it's my faith that has helped me through that. I don't attend church now, but I will listen to church services online. I love listening to my Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir or gospel reggae, gospel, or something like that. It helps me through this [tough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2690s) time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2690s)

So we should just, for those that don't know, our viewers and listeners, are you up to telling the viewers and listeners what happened to your daughter?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2702s)

Sure. Haven was born premature and born after a miscarriage, so she was a rainbow baby. She was born at 35 weeks and one day, so she was like two months early. She weighed three pounds, 14 ounces. She was born by emergency cesarean. I had a really horrible pregnancy with her, unfortunately.

Because of my body attacking itself, I was still having issues with my own health and on heavy drugs for the pain. They were worried that she would be born reliant on that, but thankfully I hadn't been on it long enough for it to affect her. She was in the NICU for like two weeks. She breathed and fed very well on her own. She just needed to gain weight, really.

She came home [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2765s) weeks later and she was still under, I think, under five pounds. Just teensy-weensy. People thought I was carrying a doll. She was precious, just beautiful and full of life. Because of her ADHD, she was always on the go, always talking, always singing, always dancing. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2796s) thank God for The Wiggles. I think I know every Wiggle song there is.

When she started school, her pediatrician decided to put her on medication for her ADHD. It started to be okay, like she was doing well, and then I didn't think it was working, so I took her off. The teacher said, "Well, she's not doing so well with her writing and so forth." So I said, "Okay, I'll put her back on." But actually, that was probably, looking back now, when she got the start of the tumor.

We had noticed things for at least a month prior to her actual [diagnosis,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2847s) and I had taken her to the emergency room to see a doctor there. He just swept it under the rug. "No, it's just her ADHD. This is common with kids with ADHD, their balance isn't great." I'm like, "This is beyond not normal. It's beyond what is expected of them." I even took her to the pediatrician and he was not convinced either. I'm like, "Really, what does it take to get you people to listen?"

[Then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2877s) we started seeing her eyes cross. I decided that I would book an appointment for her eyes to be tested. The same day, I ended up booking an appointment with my pediatrician. The teacher, well actually she's an occupational therapist, said to me, "Julie, have you been noticing these changes with Haven?" I said, "Yep, yep. I see her eyes that are crossed. I see the way she's looking. And I [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2908s) that she's been falling a lot."

I have her booked for an eye appointment. She goes, "No, I think you need to get this looked at a little bit more." I said, "Hey, I have tried. So would you mind writing a letter so that I can have that sent to my pediatrician?" She's like, "Yeah, sure. Just sign this waiver." I signed the waiver, she sends it off to the pediatrician, and I get this appointment with him.

He actually had the letter in hand when [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2938s) was on the phone with him. I was at work that day and he goes, "You need to take her to the hospital right now." So we went from the eye appointment to the hospital. They really didn't do anything locally. They sent us down to Victoria and we did a CAT scan there. They came back and told me that she had a brain tumor in the pons area of her brain stem, in the central nervous system, known as [DIPG,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=2968s) Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. It's quite common in children between one and five. The lifespan is about six to 12 months.

Anyways, we got transferred to Children's Hospital. We were airlifted by air ambulance, so she kind of got one of her wishes to go on an airplane. She fell asleep and we stayed there, I don't know exactly how long we were there, maybe a week at the most. Then I came back. They talked about my options, which was radiation. They don't do biopsies because of where it is in the brain; doing it could actually do more damage. And they don't do operations, they don't remove it.

Radiation was really the only option. I was initially [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3029s) down that route. They were trying to book a time for her to go in and get what they call a mask made for her, because they have to put this mask on them so they can isolate the area where they want to target with the radiation.

It just wasn't going to work out because I said, "No, I need to be home to be there for Kyra because she's graduating from elementary school and I promised her I would be there. I'm not gonna back down on my promise." So I said, "If you can try to arrange a time after that, that would be great." But I was annoyed because the various doctors and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3081s) were not communicating. It had just gone right out the window.

I got frustrated and I just said, "You know what, I don't want to do this." I have a good friend that has kind of taken me under his wing and treated me like a daughter locally here. He has studied psychology, like different types of groups of people, and he's also counseled at the Victoria Hospice. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3111s) just said, "I've seen what radiation and chemo does to families and it's just not a pretty picture."

I said, "Well, I just don't want to grieve twice." Because I'm grieving now, and then hypothetically speaking, I give her the radiation, ultimately she's still gonna die. So then I'm back to square one and we're grieving again. I had to think about my kids too. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3142s) knew the doctors were saying to me, because of her ADHD, you have to be really still when getting radiation. It meant that they'd have to sedate her every day for six weeks.

I'm like, "No." I saw what the sedation did while you guys did an MRI. She barely woke up. It took forever and that scared me. I said, "No, I'm not willing to put her through sedation every day [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3172s) six weeks. That's just ridiculous."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3175s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3176s)

I'm not going to be terrified every day. And I have to think about my other kids. It would mean that they wouldn't be able to be with me. So I said, "No, I think I'm just going to go check out Canuck Place," which is the hospice. They are more about quality of life, giving them memories to think about, rather than quantity. That was what I wanted for Haven and for us, to make memories [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3206s) for her to be free from pain as much as possible and just to go peacefully and let her be with God.

So, it was ups and downs. We were there at Canuck Place for two weeks while they sorted out her meds and got a baseline of what she's like. They got her on morphine and so she seemed like she was quite happy and in a place where we could come home. We came home for six days and then she got a chest infection and fever. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3246s) by this time I had nurses coming in to visit to check on her regularly, and they decided that we need to go back to Canuck Place. Because she was considered palliative, they made space for me immediately.

I said to the nurses, "Well, next time we go home, Haven won't be coming with us. This is it. She's gonna die here." And they said, "Well, we don't know that." I said, "I'm telling you, that's what's gonna happen because I'm a sensitive and I can pick up on things." I said, "My brother was killed on July 27th, so I have my eyes on the 27th." They said, "Well, she might have her own day." I said, "Yeah, she might, but it's gonna be there or thereabouts."

The Monday prior to that, we went out to North Vancouver and she had a huge blowout on the way home. That's usually when [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3312s) see the tumor progressing. She would have these outbursts of behavior and just not be able to explain what's wrong, that she's in terrible pain or whatever the case is.

Then the nurses sat down with us that night and said, "Based on the changes we've seen with her," because she's having trouble swallowing at this point and her voice was weak, "we'd have to listen quite carefully." She was very aware that she was losing her voice. They said, "Based on these changes, [she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3357s) most likely not going to be able to communicate with you much longer. One of her requests is that you sleep with her, stay in the room." I said, "Okay, well, we haven't really wanted to because it seems like we agitate her more, but I will stay with her."

Thank God I did, because the next morning I wake up, went into the bathroom, come back, she's awake. I went and said good morning to her, went to the side of her bed, and she just grabbed my hand. Then I start seeing that she's struggling to breathe. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3388s) I said, "Mommy needs to call the nurse." I was turning to go and she just grabbed my hand, "No, no." She didn't say anything, but she didn't want me to leave. So I said, "Well, I'll use the call bell."

I got the nurse to come in. I said, "Look, she's struggling to breathe right now. It seems like we never really got rid of that raspiness from the infection." So they gave her oxygen and a fan and medication, and I was able to call the girls down. They said hi to her and then she went unconscious. She was unconscious for four days until she passed.

We just watched the breathing decline. I think it started with like five breaths and a pause, and then [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3441s) later that next evening, she was down to four breaths and a pause. It just slowly decreased over time until the breathing was so bad, I actually had to leave the room at one point because I was just so distraught.

I went upstairs to where me and the girls were sleeping. Of course, I had called Papa Ron over and [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3471s) girls were in her room. I texted Kyra, my 13-year-old, "How's Haven? Has there been any changes?" And she just said, "Well, the nurse says that she's not going to be here much longer." So I said, "Okay, I'm going to come."

I went back downstairs and I called my friend from my grandfather's church, Faith. So her and her daughter, Janessa, showed up from Maple Ridge. I've been keeping my eye on Haven quite well, but Faith distracted me. She wanted to show me some song or something, and in the next minute, Faith looked and she goes, "Oh, I think she stopped breathing." I turned and I said, "Yeah, she has. She's gone."

So we called the nurse and [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3521s) Kyra and Janessa were just having a conversation, so they didn't even pick up on what had happened. I had to tell Kyra two or three times, "Sorry, she's gone. She's gone, that's it." Kyra just burst in tears. She's like, "I've lost my little sister." I said, "She'll always be your little sister. Just because she's not here doesn't mean that she's not your little sister still." [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3552s)

I understood what she was feeling, the grief. She's a very outgoing, bubbly, butterfly-type person. She's got a lot of friends and is involved in a lot of things. She's strong-minded and she tells me what she thinks. Whereas Kaylee is very reserved and quiet and very resilient. Honestly, I don't think I've seen her shed one tear. It's amazing [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3599s) kids are so different.

I don't think that it... I think it does still affect her, but she has just delved into her arts and the things that she likes to do, which is drawing and coloring. She's very artistic. It's amazing, each kid takes it different or goes through it at a different time too. Sometimes it takes them a little while to [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3630s) really start to heal from it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3635s)

Wow. You've been through so much, Julie. So much.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3643s)

Yeah, so much. That's why I say I'm just waiting for the next bad thing to happen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3647s)

Yeah, and that's kind of what I wanted to just jump into. Post-leaving the brethren and going through everything you've been through, what do you find are the lingering psychological results of being in a cult like we were in?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3667s)

Trauma, panic attacks, anxiety, depression. Just what I call snapping at people. It could be just somebody saying something to me and I just break down in tears. I have to explain to them, "Not all disabilities are visible to your eye. Some things are not seen." I technically have PTSD. I would say I actually have [complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3704s) post-traumatic stress disorder. So those are, you know, and relationship issues still.

In terms of work, I'm able to work, but I never know when something will trigger me, and it's sometimes completely unexpected. I do find the CBD helps. I've been put back on a medication for the depression. I said to my doctor, "I've had depression before this happened, but this is just like another layer to it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3755s)

That's a lot on your plate though, right? You deserve to be on an antidepressant after what you've been through.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3762s)

Yeah, I think it's helping. It's hard to say as of right now because I've only been on it for maybe a week, but I think it at least takes the edge off. Thankfully, I'm still able to find joy in some things, like my music and my crafts and stuff like that. I've been taking to making some earrings lately.

Thanks. Yeah. I made more and Clara made some for her friends. Kaylee makes bracelets or necklaces for herself, but I think she could probably make stuff for others and sell them. I worked on one gem art that says, "We have somebody in heaven, so we have a piece of heaven in our home," or something to that effect. Now I'm working on chickens. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3828s) love a French country home. And now, going back to my DNA, it all kind of makes sense why I like what I like.

So yeah, I would say those are the main things that from leaving the brethren just don't go away. I have struggles with stupid things, like going to church and seeing men wearing shorts and I'm like, "That's not okay." Or I remember going to a Pentecostal church and it's more not so strict, but she was wearing, I think, Minnie Mouse or Mickey Mouse, or reading the scriptures on their phones. Little things like that that are just so trivial.

It frustrates me, makes me mad, and I'm like, "Why?" I actually question myself as to those things. "Why does that frustrate you? Why does that make you mad? Why can't you just..." It's not about how you come to church, it's you just come as you are. So I try to reason with myself and I'm very analytical. I think that's actually helped me to change who I am, or was, rather.

So I'm more open-minded. As Ron says, "You're conservative yet open-minded, but not open-minded enough for your brain to fall out."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3928s)

I love that. That's a good one. Okay. I'm going to share some pictures here. You've sent some pictures to us and we're going to walk through them.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3947s)

This is my brother, Anthony, sitting on the stairs of the house. He was five and the little teddy bear slash mouse was actually one of my favorite stuffies which I lost somewhere along the line. We lived in this house until I was five years old.

There's my two brothers again. Anthony is in the red and [Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3977s) is in the gray.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3981s)

Sorry.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=3983s)

They were 13 or 14 months apart. Close in age, very close in age. Always into trouble. This was a trip from school, going to the Parliament buildings in Victoria. So there's myself and Ruth Ballard and Jannie Boram and Laurie Ballard. Jannie's sister, Rachel, is Laurie and Ruth's mother, so she's their [aunt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4013s) And we're dressed in brethren attire.

This is my mom and my grandparents on my mom's side, my brother Bob and myself. This is at the airport in Richmond. They'd come and visit often from England.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4032s)

Your mom looks a lot like her mom. Definitely. And the typical attire that the brethren wore back then.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4037s)

Definitely. There's the house that we lived in till I was five. The stairs were where Anthony was sitting. Back then the house was white, but the next owners painted it. It actually doesn't stand anymore. There's another house there, so I cherish that picture.

This is the second house that we lived in. We hated the color of it, but we ended up loving it. I think I was about seven or eight here, and we grew this huge sunflower. My mom's like, "Look how big it is. Stand beside it and we'll take a picture." And then we were off to meeting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4092s)

Oh yeah, you've got the scarf on. Everybody had the little Jerry curls like that.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4098s)

Curls, yeah. That's myself in the back and Trenton, Gracie who is deaf, and my mom.

Myself, my brother behind me, and then my cousins Trevor and Norman who live in Portland, Oregon. We'd spend a lot of time at my Auntie Susie's house. That's Deanna and me, my cousin. We would be confused for each other, especially from the back because we looked the same.

Eventually, I grew taller and then at one point we both had glasses. Then Deanna decided that she'd go with contacts, and so that was sort of the one thing that differentiated us. She had no glasses and I had glasses, but I still got confused. People would say, "Oh, hi Deanna," from the back and then they'd turn around like, "Oh, it's you." [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4161s) she lives in Ohio and she has five children. She's still in the brethren. She married Denny Southard. Southard's a very prominent family in the brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4189s)

When you see this movement taken off that's happening all over, in your personal opinion, what do you hope to see out of all of this?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4201s)

I'd love to see the brethren just not be a thing. I'd love them to know the truth, actually. To be able to have the blinders taken off their eyes and to actually see it from our perspective.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4226s)

From the outside perspective. And do you feel that there's an accountability that needs to happen from the past?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4236s)

Not at all. I know John was made accountable for what happened to our family and to another family, I probably shouldn't mention names. He was made to actually sit back, lose his position, apologize, blah, blah, blah. But to me, that was just like, it means nothing. Why don't you come and apologize to my face and actually know what you did? [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4266s) decisions that you made, how it affected my life personally.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4270s)

Yeah. I think that's what I mean. Like, in my personal opinion, it's like cleaning up the past needs to be done a little bit different than what they've done. The amount of suffering that a lot of survivors and ex-members have gone through, I don't think they've even touched the ripple effects that that has had upon our children.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4295s)

Exactly. They're still in denial. "Oh, we didn't do that. We don't do that." You are such liars. Why don't you just tell the truth? You see it in so many different religions, like with the Catholics and the priests that have hurt so many young boys. "Well, we don't want to talk about that. It didn't happen. We're just going to sweep it under the rug." That's not the freaking answer.

I know it makes you look bad, but let's deal with reality. This is one of my issues with Doug. He doesn't want to talk about all the stuff that's happened within the brethren. He just wants to talk about the [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4334s) part of the brethren. I'm like, "But that gives the wrong impression to somebody coming from the outside who sees it from the outside. That makes them look like they're good people, but that's not reality."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5eDqAds_IlI%26t%3D4344s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4345s)

You have to talk about the ugly stuff. And I'm glad that the ugly stuff gets talked about in terms of the brethren and in terms of the message believers because they want to put on this facade and I just say they're fake, frauds, and full of shit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4364s)

Yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4367s)

Because they see me, and they'd seen me because I was living in Langley where all the brethren have moved to, and I lived amongst them for quite a while even while I was out. One day I was on the streets and Craig Boram and Linda Fraser were taking a walk. She's a very devout brethren, don't rock the boat at all. She just said, "You [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4397s) we're thinking of you, Julie." And I'm like, "Oh, please, just take your crap elsewhere." You wouldn't actually... I think she might have said, "We were praying for you." And I was like, "You wouldn't even say that if you didn't see me. It's so not real."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4413s)

Just shut it down. It's just the facade. Just don't talk to me.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4417s)

Yeah. Do you have any relationship with your mom at all? Has she reached out at all? She did reach out because, well, I actually reached out to my brother first but he didn't...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4432s)

Oh, you muted yourself, love.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4439s)

I called Peter and Pat, I think it was Peter and Pat, and I talked to Pat. I can't remember. I called somebody in the brethren and told them that I would like a message sent to my mother that Haven had passed away, or that she was sick, and then eventually that she passed away.

My mom did call me when I was at Canuck Place and it wasn't... I mean, it started off okay. She's always on the surface. We don't ever talk about [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4482s) deep, no deep conversations. It's always like, "Oh yeah, well, I know what you're going through because Stephen had breathing problems." I'm like, "Who are you talking about?" "Well, my brother Stephen." I'm like, "Okay, I didn't understand who you were talking about."

Then she moved on to talk about how the doctors had treated her because she had breast cancer. They had said that they could do [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4512s) different treatments and it meant going into this MRI-type machine, and she's very claustrophobic. So she's like, "Well, I won't be able to do that." So they said, "Okay, that's fine." She's explaining to me how they were very understanding and really good with her. And like, this has become about you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4539s)

Yeah. And you needed her to hold space for you at that moment.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4545s)

But I already knew that I couldn't expect anything from her because the truth is, she never had help or counseling for the death of my brother. So how could I expect her to give me any kind of advice, understanding, empathy, compassion, anything? I can't. I remember Dr. Phil saying, "You can't expect anything from somebody that they're not able to give." [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4577s) I'm like, "Oh, that's what it is. She can't actually give me love and so there's no point in seeking for it from her. She's incapable of giving it to me."

And it still shows today. I've had another conversation with her since, because she didn't know Haven had passed. It always leads to, "Well, you know, you're not where you belong." And I just said to her, "I'm sorry, but I just don't agree with you about that. We have different ideas." I said, "Everybody's been given free will to make choices in life and then you have to live with the consequences of those decisions. I made my choice and you made yours, and that's fine. We don't have to agree." But the brethren's idea is like, "It's our way or it's no way at all. You're just going to go to hell." I so desperately would love her to see [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4639s) it doesn't have to be like that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4639s)

And things that happen, like being raised where we were raised, things that happen that are bad, they were tended to be portrayed to us as punitive. And God is not punitive. Bad things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. And really, it's how you come out on the other end of it that shows whether it's a win or not. It's really, really hard and it's [gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4669s) take you a long time. But in the long run, you'll be able to look back and say, "I've grown from this."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4675s)

For sure. That Viking warrior in you is just emerging. Oh yeah, tough cookie, definitely. And it all makes sense. But it doesn't make it any easier, right? And that's what I think people need to understand is that sometimes when you've been given the plate that you've been given, you just want someone to take that plate for you for just a little bit so that you can breathe, sleep, and replenish a bit.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4703s)

For sure. We might be strong, but even the strong have moments of weakness. And it's interesting you say that, Carman, because she said, "Well, you know, maybe you should think about what God's trying to tell you from this situation." And I'm like, "What difference does it make? Something bad happened to you. My brother was killed in a car accident and you were in the brethren. Did that mean that you were [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4733s) of God's will or doing sin?"

Here I am on the outside, bad stuff happens to us on the outside too. Life is everywhere. God is not a punishment God. That's not what he does to us. And she's like, "Well, you have no idea what God has done for me in my life." And I said, "And you don't know what God has done for me in my life." She's trying to [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4763s) that God is not doing anything for me, like that God's not even in my life anymore, that I've just given up on God, that I've thrown away my faith, that I'm just going to hell and I'm going the way of the world.

But in truth, actually, because I left the brethren, I got saved. I actually have a relationship with the Lord that I never would have even dreamed of having. 

**Carman Drever**

Had she [gotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4794s) good out of it, she would be... you can tell someone who has gained something by the fruits of it. And had she gained something from it, her compassion, her understanding, her ability to embrace you when you're in that position would have showed. And that's not what you're describing to me.

**Julie Fletcher**

Well no, because like I said, she wasn't even able to get help for her own loss. So it's going to [affect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4824s) her and she's not going to be able to help me during or through mine.

Talking about my dad, I had told my Uncle Brian and he wanted me to tell my father. I said, "No, I don't want to talk to my father and I really don't want to tell him because Haven died the next day after my brother's death anniversary." Like, how bad is that? Call my dad up and say, "Oh yeah, by the way, Haven passed away and she died the day after [Anthony."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4854s)

This accident has affected both my dad and my brother since it happened. My father is what you call a closet alcoholic. He likes to hide his alcohol in ginger ale or something like that. And my brother, I don't know what he's like now, but I know that he's had his issues with drinking for sure. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4884s) affects them negatively.

Anyways, my Uncle Brian suggested that I write a letter to my father, so I was going to do that, and I just said, "Fine, I'll just call him and tell him." But I told him straight up, "I really don't want to tell you this because I know it's just gonna lead to you drinking. Please don't drink, Dad. Please don't go and drink because of this happening."

He's a narcissist, right? So immediately when I tell him that Haven passed away, he's like, "Oh, well, did she ever get the COVID shot?" He's always looking to blame something or someone. I said, "No, my other kids had the shots and they're perfectly fine. She has a brain tumor. It's not even remotely connected."

So there's a typical narcissist. And again, going back to my DV, through being in that situation, that person was a narcissist. I think through learning about narcissism and being able to recognize those flags, I realized my father is too. And that's kind of why I don't want... he does the same thing. Any conversations are always about him. So I'm just like, I realized talking to my mother was a trigger in a negative way and I just prefer not to have further communications with either of my parents.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4982s)

You have to make certain boundaries to survive.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=4984s)

Yeah. You learn what is healthy and what's not healthy. And they're not healthy. I don't want any triggers in my life. My father actually tried to throw me down the stairs in Calgary because I refused to listen to him talk against my mother. After that happened, I just never really trusted him again. I'm like, "I'm never leaving my kids in your care. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5014s) don't want you around me. I don't want you hurting my children. This cycle must stop here."

**Carman Drever**

Well, and I think you need to be really proud of yourself that you have stood up and said, "This is not going to continue for the next generation." 

**Julie Fletcher**

And I've said that to my kids. "I want you to be better than I am and I was. I want you to have choices that I didn't have. I want you to make decisions for yourself very soon." Because my oldest is 16, she needs to start making [choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5055s) for herself now. What's she going to do for school? I'd suggested graphic arts, but I think she wants to actually go into acting, like into drama and stuff. I'm like, "Oh, are you going to go to Broadway, Kaylee?" She's like, "Yeah, maybe." I'm like, "Oh, well, you go, girl."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5074s)

That's the beautiful thing of coming out, right? And being able to gift your children freedom.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5083s)

Freedom and the support that we didn't have as brethren. We didn't get support from our parents to do anything, to have choices, to make decisions, to want anything good for ourselves. Kyra wants to follow in my footsteps into health care. And I said, "Well, if you want to go into health care, be a nurse. You go big or go home, girl." I mean, care aides are needed, but nurse is where it's at because there's so many more opportunities as a nurse.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5121s)

Wow. Well, thank you so much. We really appreciate you coming on here and pouring your heart out so soon after losing your precious daughter. I think every survivor that comes on here and gives a piece of their life, what it was like inside and post, really inspires and helps those inside. Everybody inside finds a piece of themselves in every story that is told. So we are very, very grateful of you coming on here. Is there anything that you would like to add?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5159s)

No, I just want to say thank you to you and to Carman and for your support. I know Carman understands on a personal level because I know she's experienced loss. Only parents that have lost a child understand what that's like, 100%. And I'm there anytime you need me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5159s)

Appreciate it.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5159s)

You guys are wonderful. Thank you for giving everybody a platform to speak. It's not always easy to come forward and speak up, but it needs to be done. And I'm so proud of everybody that has, especially you, Cheryl. I'm proud of you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDqAds_IlI&t=5205s)

I'm proud of you for coming and speaking your truth.

It's hard, but we're seeing the results of it. Thank you so much, Julie, for pouring your heart out to us all. And until next time, everyone, take care. Much love to everyone. Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
