## Summary

The ripples of harm from the PBCC extend beyond their own church
Meet Sarah - an ex member of the Shanklin Gospel Hall. This small group are believed to be an offshoot of the Exclusive Brethren or PBCC as they are now known. Sarah is an author and accredited researcher who has spent much of her time uncovering her own past and the links to spiritual abuse. She has also been diagnosed with autism and goes into her links of abuse with those who are autistic.
Elders of this church followed the teachings of JT Jr. The absolute belief that their way is right and any other pathway is darkness will resonate with all ex members of the PBCC and could serve to help those inside to realize that there are many totalitarian religious groups who belief they are the only ones with ‘the truth’
This coercion, used to uphold this belief, is now acknowledged as spiritual abuse. This type of abuse is becoming more recognized, and there is a strong movement adding to the already agreed list of abuses.
Join us as we explore exactly what spiritual abuse is and how to spot the warning signs of it.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=57s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here tonight with our friends Ross and Gilli and our special guest tonight is Sarah. Sarah was actually an ex-member of the Shanklin Gospel Hall, which is an offshoot of the Open Brethren, and the parallels to the PBCC, which we all know very well, are very similar. So I'm going to hand the floor to Sarah and tell us your story, Sarah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=87s)

Right. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks so much, everyone, for inviting me on. It's lovely to meet you. And yeah, so where to begin?

Okay. So my family and I moved, well, we moved to the Isle of Wight in, gosh, the early eighties, I think. I'm a bit hazy. It's a few years ago now, to be fair. It was quite a, it was a, it was a difficult time. My family, my mum and dad split up and it was very harmonious and I lived with my mum, but when they first split up, my father disappeared off the face of the earth for months. I didn't see him, [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=128s) know what was going on.

I was really bullied at school and I never fitted in anywhere. I was always quite different to other people. I was brainy, quite intelligent, outwardly gregarious, but I never knew how to, I don't know, join in the party. It's almost like I was in a bubble and like everybody else knew what to do socially and I didn't. And it was a really confusing time. I found out later on in life when I was 42 that [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=162s) autistic. I also had the recent diagnosis of ADHD as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=166s)

So just to put that into context for our listeners, at this point in time, when you were having these difficulties, you weren't a member of any church?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=176s)

Well, not exactly. I mean, both my parents were raised in Leicestershire and they were both, I think that's how they met actually, you know, nominally Christian. They came from Methodist families, so there was a sort of, there was a sort of a background. I mean, I remember getting confirmed. I went to, I think I went to, I remember going to Sunday school, but it wasn't sort of the kind of sort of [faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=207s) life that was sort of particularly, I don't know, dominant in the family. It was a bit more sensible, I suppose, in some ways.

So I had that bit of sort of like, you know, Christian background, but I wasn't a Christian. I don't think I was anyway, but I would never have said I was really. I went to the Gospel Hall first because I had met another girl at school, [Jo,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=237s) who had moved from Canada with her family and I was in the lower sixth form at the time and, you know, we became sort of friendly and everything and she invited me along to the Gospel Hall.

I was what I suppose would have been called quite a troubled teenager. I was in a real mess. I'd experienced sort of quite a lot of, not just the bullying, but quite a lot of abuse and sort of sexual abuse. And you [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=267s) should give a heads up about this, shouldn't we, before we start talking about it? Actually, we can add to it at the beginning, is that okay? Because yeah, there's a lot of this stuff and, and a lot of neglect and childhood sexual abuse as well.

So I think I experienced quite a lot of this before actually going into the Brethren. And I'd been raised in a family which was very, very patriarchal and that women were expected to serve men. Wives were there to support their husbands, [daughters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=298s) were there to look after their fathers in their old age. But that was coupled with this really almost contradictory social climbing from my father, because he really groomed us actually to go to university. There was no actual choice in any of that. My brothers and myself, this was the goal. The only goal that mattered was university.

And so as I turn [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=328s) at the Gospel Hall in a bit of a mess really, but actually a bit of a, a bit of a, well, very good at sort of masking and covering up and not really understanding what was really going on for me because I just, I don't know, I just lived in a ball of confusion really. And I just sort of like tried to carry on by putting a brave face on and a smile. And, you know, I learned well from my mother who was very kind of like, you must smile for the men, dear, that sort of thing. Yeah, yeah, I know.

Anyway, okay, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=366s) I turned up at the Gospel Hall with my beret because obviously, obviously head covering. I didn't really understand anything about that at the time, but I just did it because that's what was expected. And I was so passive really and rather a people pleaser that I would have just, I just went along with it really. Anyway, well, the first person I met when I went in there was this guy called Sid, who was one of the elders. And he took one look at me and he said, "Oh, we're gonna have trouble with this one because she's good [looking."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=396s) And I, you know, I should have known that that was a red flag. I should have known that that was a red flag right from the word go, that given my background...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=405s)

To put this into context, at this time you were how old?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D411s)

Oh, 16, 17\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D413s)

And I assume it was an older guy.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=415s)

Oh, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=416s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=417s)

Yes. I'll be more about Sid later on, actually. But anyway, so I sat down in extremely hard wooden chairs, as you do, with Jo and her family and kind of, I mean, just observed, really. But then the preaching happened and it was all very austere because that's what it was. Women weren't allowed to talk. We weren't allowed to pray, weren't allowed to do anything like that. So, you know, there was no sort of, there was music. There were hymns and there was this sort of like really sort of crappy little organ in the corner that they would play. But nothing like guitars, because obviously that is the devil's music, naturally.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=458s)

And to draw parallels, how were you? You talked about hard wooden chairs. I remember hard wooden chairs in old Brethren meeting halls. How were you seated? Did people sit as families or did they...

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=471s)

Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Right. Um, yeah. Anyway, the preaching started and I, and you know, I think I was just so desperate for someone to pay me some attention or to sort of like, you know, show me that I actually mattered that I absolutely lapped it up. And I'm, you know, talking, you know, and it was usual hellfire and brimstone style preaching as well. It wasn't the sort of like the Jesus loves you stuff. It was like, you know, if you don't believe in God, you're going straight to hell. And oh, by the way, there's the tribulation and if you're lucky, you'll be raptured and if you're not, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=502s) going to be left behind. It's going to be an absolute horror show.

And I kind of thought, blimey, better get on board with this. And I did. I did ask Jesus, actually, no, it wasn't not asking Jesus into your life, it's asking Jesus Christ into your life, because they would never refer to him as Jesus, it was always Jesus Christ. There was never that sort of sense of familiarity or sort of sense of, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=532s) know, the joy and warmth of God's love. It was just always very austere and very threatening. It was just being scared, terrified into the kingdom of God type of thing.

Well, anyway, I became, I became involved with the church and particularly with this family. And things came then came to a head with my family. My both my parents had remarried. I was with my mother and stepfather. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=562s) wasn't very nice. He was a, you know, there's nothing, you know, dodgy like that, but he was, he was a really nasty and nasty bully and we didn't get on. And I ended up just running away. I ran away on Mother's Day. That's really bad timing. And I didn't have anywhere to go. I just didn't have anywhere to go. There was nobody I knew, not really. I didn't feel I could go to anybody. I didn't feel close enough to anybody at school to go to anyone's house or anything. So I ended up going to this prominent family in the Brethren church.

And they ran a hotel, a Christian hotel, and they put me up for a few weeks while other accommodation could be found for me. It was a really weird situation because I get the feeling my mother was sort of like just waiting for me to leave home. I got that feeling because nobody wanted me back. Neither my father or my mother wanted me to live with them.

And this is in the 80s where there was the, you know, the welfare system in the UK was kinder then. And it was possible for me to have a few benefits and to get housing benefit. And so it was arranged for me to have a bedsit in Shanklin and live there by myself while I then restarted my A-levels and did my A-levels. And it was really, yeah, it was hard. It was hard because it was like, I mean, I've heard some of the absolutely appalling, appalling stories of what happened to the Plymouth Brethren Church of people being separated from their families for years. Sometimes people dying without ever reconciling, all this kind of thing. I mean, that is truly horrific.

And that didn't happen to me, but what did happen was that [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=690s) were, I was caught between these two sets of people. On the one hand, there was my father, who his only concern was for me to get to university and really did not like the Brethren because he thought that they were very anti-educational, the rest of it. And he wasn't wrong. He wasn't wrong. Yeah. And then you have the Brethren who completely disapproved of my father because, oh yeah, he was a Freemason. [He's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=720s) a Freemason. So I mean, you know, that's not my fault. That's not my fault, but he is. He's a Freemason. They are completely disapproved of that. And which is ironic if you think about it, but anyway. And they disapproved of his person because he was divorced and remarried.

And so I was caught between these two sets of people as a young teenager who was really messed up anyway because of all the things and just, I don't know, living this almost double life trying to please everybody. And it was just awful. And then realising that the sort of even though I can see all the red flags now, then I could, I just couldn't, I was just in this thing. And then I did realise that sort of like the kindness that had been shown to me was very, very conditional, really conditional. And I was only acceptable if I did what they, as it turned out, [hypocritically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=792s) expected of me.

It was very frowned upon for us to have any sort of, to have any sort of connection with other churches because obviously Brethren were the only sort of like owners of the truth, whatever that means, you know, anyway. So, you know, but we did, we did hang out with other, you know, sort of Christians even though it wasn't approved of, but it was like everything was so restrictive.

I mean, I was a [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=825s) creative, I mean, I am now again, but I was such a creative person. I used to, I used to just, I mean, I still love sort of like music, makeup, clothes, all of that stuff, all that stuff you experiment with when you're, you know, you're a young teenager. I really loved that. And I was quite, I was quite a goth at that point as well. And, you know, I found music just to be so brilliant because everything else was just so hard in life [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=855s) me at the time that I really, really loved music and all these things. But slowly but surely, they absolutely chipped all that away.

I just remember being called a Jezebel. And I've learned about this Jezebel spirit bullshit, quite frankly, you know, subsequently. But it's so damaging for someone who's in their formative years to be told that if you wear makeup, you are a harlot. If you wear jewelry, you're basically a satanist. And if you listen to music other than, I mean, I've got all four choruses or, you know, some classical music, then [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=904s) know, you are again satanic and devilish.

And it actually got to the point where I just felt that I had to destroy my record collection, which I did. I did. And it was, it was horrendous. It really was. So it was like I was already weird and different and, you know, bullied and all that kind of thing. But being in the Brethren made me doubly so [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=935s) I wasn't being a normal teenager at all. You know, the things that normal teenagers do, like, you know, hanging out with their mates, going to gigs, going to the pub, whatever, all of that, none of that was approved of. You know, everything was just so shut down.

And you know, I remember at the hotel one night, there was one girl there and she described her car having broken down. And she'd broken down just by a pub. It was dark. She was a woman by herself, young woman by herself, but she was too scared to go into the pub to ask for help because she had been told that they were devilish places. I mean, that is just a safeguarding nightmare that that was what was in her head, that this was not a good place to be.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=987s)

I think we all get that from our experiences. How many in the Gospel Hall that you went to, the Brethren church, how big was the congregation?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=997s)

I mean, it's changed over the years. I mean, it was, oh, I don't know, about 20\. I'm not very good at this kind of thing, actually. About 20 people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1004s)

So small.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1005s)

It's never very big.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1006s)

But I, and did they integrate with any, you said that wasn't approved for them to integrate with any other churches. So they were a very isolated church, were they?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1015s)

Yeah, they were in a sense. I mean, there were, there were other gospel halls on the island. And there was one in Cowes, I think there was one in Newport, there's one in Ventnor, I think. Yes. And there were connections between them because I think they were, they were all considered to be Open Brethren. Right. Yes. Yeah. The way Shanklin behaved is that they were very exclusive. Yes. Because they, they, they had elders like Sid who had come from very Plymouth Brethren backgrounds, as far as I understand. Yeah. So it was a very strict kind of setup. Yeah.

And as I learned over time, extraordinarily hypocritical as well, because I, you know, there [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1059s) were things, I just, it was like they didn't care about people. They didn't care about humanity. There was one time when I was with a friend who had been going through some really difficult stuff. She'd had a bit to drink and she was then subsequently a bit unwell. And I get very panicky about that sort of thing. So I phoned up somebody from the, from that family at the hotel. I said, "I really want to help my friend. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1089s) don't know what to do. She's not very well." She said, "She shouldn't have been drinking. You need to leave her alone."

And I was like, even then I was like, what? Because I was so, I was so kind of like, I guess the word is brainwashed, actually. And such a people pleaser and just so not knowing anything that I needed, or that was even vaguely important. You know, I mattered. I just didn't really think about it.

But then there were other things like, you know, I was really, you know, one thing about autistic people is that we are really, really hot on social justice. A lot of us really, really care about stuff and we're very tenacious and we don't let go and we just, you know, we, and we're not afraid. We are fearless and we just go and challenge all this awful stuff that's out there. I mean, Greta Thunberg, for example. Anyway, Chris Packham, for example.

Anyway, so all this kind of stuff. And you know, at the [time,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1144s) even though I didn't know I was autistic, I was like, this isn't right. There's so many things going on in this world that are terrible. We need to, you know, we're Christians, we need to be helping, you know, we need to be sort of doing the Sermon on the Mount stuff, you know, in the Bible. But apparently, apparently we don't need to worry about things like that in the Bible because it's only the tribulation. And was it pre-millennial, well, is it a millennial? I never remember which one it is [now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1174s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1174s)

I don't think I could help you there.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1178s)

All of that, all of that. And then, and you know, it was at the time when all the, uh, Late Great Planet Earth, the Hal Lindsey stuff had quite recently been published and there was the, the Left Behind films that had been made in the 70s. I mean, we were like, you know, force-fed this stuff basically. And everything was very sort of, uh, you know, seven day creationism and all this kind of stuff. And it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1208s) just very repressive.

But then I noticed, I noticed that there was stuff that was very questionable, but I wouldn't have questioned it because I was a woman and that old girl and therefore, you know, had, you know, all these men as my head and I was there to serve men. So therefore I didn't question anything.

There was one woman I used to go and sit with [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1238s) just chat in like an old people's home just down the road from the hotel. She was great. She was very, very mischievous and she was fun. But I really, I wish I'd done something at the time. I didn't really realise, I made the connections later on. She was absolutely controlled by them. And I suspect, I have no proof, but I suspect that she may have, they may have controlled her financially as well because [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1269s) said things to me like, "Oh, I'd love to do that, but Sid wouldn't approve." Right. Yeah. And at the time, I guess I must have thought, oh, well, yeah, that's Sid, because that's it. Yeah. But actually in later years, I was like, yeah, I think, I think they were really, really controlling her and coercing her. It's pretty grim.

And then I saw things like other members of the [church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1299s) who had visitations from the elders because something had happened. And when I didn't know, I didn't know all the details. I wasn't privy to them because I was a woman. I didn't matter. And they had visitations. There was all these undercurrents going on. And there's this other man who was really kind, lovely man, very clever, had a couple of degrees and, you know, had maybe a slightly different theological take on things to the Brethren. So obviously he was bullied out of the meeting. He lost his family, his marriage split up. It was horrendous. He broke him, absolutely broken.

And, you know, I saw this and then I don't know, it just, it was just horrible. And it just, but it's that kind of all that sort of like sense of exceptionalism and being superior. And that absolutely steeped into me and that judgment. And I ended up just living a sort of a weird, weird double life where I just sort of like, I don't know, have these kind of quite extreme evangelical views. Well, Brethren evangelical views. But I just, and I kind of, I think I did believe it. But I think I believed it because I was scared.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1389s)

Yeah, I think we can all relate to that.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1391s)

Yeah, it was so based on fear and obedience. Something very strange happened with the boyfriend of one of the daughters of the family who owned the hotel. And it was odd. It was odd. But I didn't say anything about it at the time because I'd disclosed to [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1419s) mother of what had happened to me when I was younger and my stepfather called me a liar. And because, you know, I then basically internalized that and believed them. Believed them. Yeah, I must be a complete liar because obviously I was a Jezebel, so therefore I was a liar too. Yes. So I didn't do anything about it. But I have to say, all this stuff stayed with me for decades.

I ended up in a very abusive first marriage. [We,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1450s) my husband that we had, husband, I, we did actually get married at the Gospel Hall and he was a member...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1456s)

Of the church as well? Of the Gospel Hall?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1458s)

Sort of. I mean, we both got baptized there, but he, he'd come down from London and I see, I mean, he just drifted away from it, I think. But what we did was, well, after my first year at university, I'm like, oh, that was completely disapproved of as well, me going to university. Yeah, of course I did it. Yes. Even though I, it was so, because it was like, I never had any choice or time in any of this. I had to go to university because my father told me to, but I had the Brethren saying that you shouldn't be going to university. I was just pulled between all of this all the time.

Anyway, so Jason and I got married and I think, you know, we basically sort of like fell together because it was an escape from, because he'd had a difficult upbringing and so had I. Yeah. And so after that, I didn't really have a huge amount to do with the place. I mean, I didn't have any of that awful kind of like being pursued or, you know, not being allowed to leave type of thing. I never had any of that. I mean, they were [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1530s) glad to see the back of me, if I'm absolutely honest.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1530s)

So how many years were you quite regularly involved with them? So you said you were about 16, 17 when you went to live with this family.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1539s)

Yeah, it must have been about, when did I get married? I was 20 when I got married. So was it 21? So about four or five years at the most. But yeah, it was just, yeah, horrible experience really. But I didn't, it was just an extension of my normal, if that makes sense. And I stayed in the marriage far longer than I should have done because obviously, you know, you're a Christian wife and you, you know, you have to behave in a certain way and, you know, you don't get divorced or set up or anything like that because that's sinful anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1581s)

And at the point when you married, you said you didn't go to the Gospel Hall quite as much?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1593s)

Well, no, we did. I'd gone to university for the first year at university and then come back to the island and then got married at the Gospel Hall. So we were still connected there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1602s)

Okay, so you still had connections.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1604s)

Yeah, but it kind of like sort of, so that's sort of the impact of the spiritual abuse, because that's what it was, sort of like really impacted on how I was as a person. Yes. And sort of, you know, it impacted on my experience of being married. And [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1623s) is in addition to all the other things that have happened. Now, I'm not saying for one minute that some people's experiences of trauma are more important than others, because I think that's wrong, because trauma is trauma. People experience it differently.

Some people, an event that two people experience, one person may be okay, another person may be severely traumatized. Now, in the case of autistic people, we do know from the research that's been done recently, because this is what I do now, I'm a researcher. We do know that autistic folk have higher instances of what are called adverse childhood events. We also know that we've got a much higher chance of being bullied, victimised, sexually [abused,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1674s) domestically abused than the general population. For lots of different reasons, which we haven't got time to go into today.

But so the net result is that actually victimization, bullying and abuse becomes normalized and expected. It's kind of like your normal. Yes. And of course, I didn't know any of this at the time because I hadn't been diagnosed then, you know, but I was living with all this stuff. And then all the Brethren stuff happened. So it was like there was a lot, there was quite a lot going on [there,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1704s) I think. And I, you know, I developed a lot of really bad mental health stuff. I was self-harming. I've been self-harming for years since a teenager anyway. I was being self-harming. I was suicidal. I had severe anxiety and depression. But none of this I really knew was bad because this was the 80s and nobody knew about this stuff then. And I was just so good at covering everything up, nobody would have known.

Yeah. Anyway, so [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1735s) met my, got divorced, I got divorced, met my lovely husband and we've been married 27 years. We've been blessed with a beautiful son and got married in church, which is amazing. But anyway, that's another story. I know it was wonderful. I somehow, I don't know how I've held on to any kind of faith, actually, particularly. I was doing theology at university as well because, you know, when I first started going to St Matthews in Kingsdown in the other, sorry, in Bristol, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1766s) was probably the first place I felt that actually I could be myself. And I actually felt very accepted there.

And the vicar was just so lovely. And he had a good, we had a good old chat before Carl and I got married. And he said, "Yeah, no, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to be married in church." And it just meant so much. It meant so much. And it was like it was the first place of faith where I felt that I was acceptable to God. Interesting. Yeah. You know, and I actually learned about sort of like God's love and grace. Wow. Grace. That's amazing, isn't it? I mean, wow. There's not much of that going on in the Gospel Hall, is there? No. And, you know, sort of that side of God and Jesus that I didn't really know anything about before that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1816s)

There's one thing I'd like to pause there and just draw a parallel between what you've just said about your experience getting married in the church in your second marriage and your experience compared with your experience in the Gospel Hall. And I think there's one difference as I would see it, but you can verify this, and that would be fear. One, from what you've said, seems to be built on fear.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1842s)

Coercion and, yeah. And I think that's the, you have to have loyalty to them, to this particular group within the church.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1852s)

Yeah. And I think that's very much where the PBCC is as well. They've been very, very similar kind of regime. And yet the second church you described that you went to in Bristol, that wasn't there. The fear there wasn't sort of hell and brimstone preaching.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1870s)

No, no. No, actually. I mean, yeah, it was, it was a very different approach. It's like, you know, it's sort of, oh gosh, being able to ask questions. Yeah. You know, not actually feeling that you, you know, you can't sort of like say, "I don't quite understand that. What does that mean?" or "Actually, I don't agree with that." Yeah. Because...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1893s)

And that was okay. I mean, I remember being told in our Brethren, our old Brethren, I think Ross and Gilli could verify this, when you asked a question and it was something you didn't understand, you'd be told things like, "You're thinking with your natural mind and you need to have faith." Yeah. And it's also a parallel with something you said in one of your podcasts, Gilli, about when you went to a church outside the Brethren and the contrast when you spoke to the vicar there compared to speaking to these elders in [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1924s) Brethren churches.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1924s)

Yeah. I mean, when I, absolutely. When I, I mean, when I was living in the flat by myself on the Isle of Wight, I used to have visitations from some of the elders to see if I was living modestly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1939s)

What does that mean? We all, I think we all know. Yeah. I think the phrase that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, that what is it, "Have you got in the clear?" Was that the one they used? That was one that our Brethren lot use. You know, you need to get yourself in the clear. Well, we all know what that means. It's probably the same as living modestly, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D1959s)

Yes. Sounds like an STD test, but anyway. But yeah, so, yeah, sorry. Actually, no, I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry. I know the humor's great. No, so yeah, it wasn't great, actually.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=1980s)

And did you find, this is just something I found, did you find that even praying in a different church was different? The reason I say that is because when I was, I was still living at home, but I had actually been chucked out of the Plymouth Brethren. I was still living at home and I went down to the local normal church, you know, the Church of England, and the vicar there prayed with me and the prayer was so much different than what we'd been brought up to pray like in the Brethren.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2012s)

Yeah, oh yeah. I mean, it's the whole thing, isn't it? It's just so steeped in misogyny and frankly, abuse. Yeah. But anyway, so yeah, no, 100%, it was very, very different. But yes, anyway, so fast forwarding a few years, I ended up with a chronic ME. I've had ME for 25 years now. And, you know, the mental health stuff wasn't really getting any better. But I was diagnosed with autism at age 42\.

And actually, when you're a mum as well, and I was determined when I had my son that it wasn't going to be like when I was a kid. And I was determined that generational trauma was just, you know, getting in the bin, basically. So I [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2057s) focused on him rather than really maybe sort of maybe addressing a few things that I should have probably done to help myself and help recover and everything. But when he went to university himself and, you know, abandoned me, outrageous, I just sort of, that's, that was when I sort of like really started to think, do you know what, there's a lot going on here.

I'd been diagnosed with autism. I started to find out what that meant for me and I started to unpack [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2088s) lot of other things. And it was round about that time, my lovely, lovely friend, Lucy Peppiatt, who is the principal of the Westminster Theological College and a very, you know, she's a brilliant theologian. And, I mean, God, a woman, who knew that was possible. And, you know, she's the author of some really, really good books. And yeah, she's fantastic. Anyway, her sons and my son were good friends and Lucy and I were good friends. And she said, she sat me down, "So you need to do some stuff here. You, you, you are doing so much stuff with autism research. You need to do something academic."

So I started to think about, right, what can I do? And I hit on doing spiritual abuse because nobody had done, it's a very, very young discipline and nobody had done anything so far from like a neurodivergent, autistic point of view, because I [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2137s) suspect that there are qualitative differences. And that's not to say that that, you know, it, my life's worse than anybody else or my trauma's worse, but I think there are qualitative differences. And I started to think about this. And so I, I applied, I applied and all the rest of it and started doing the work.

And then I thought, right, well, I'd better sort of like find out a bit about the Gospel Hall myself again, because I just avoided it for so long. It was just too painful. And I went online and, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2167s) you know, just, oh, wow, they're, they're very closed, aren't they? They're very hard to get the information out. There's no websites, there's no emails, there's no phone numbers, there's nothing. But there was a Google review of the Shanklin Gospel Hall from this person who said, "For the love of God, do not let your daughters go to this place." And I just thought, oh God, what's happened? And that just took me back and it just, all those red flags popped up again. And it's like, okay.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2198s) I also did other searches and this other person came up who had also been at the Gospel Hall, right, a couple of years later than me, but also been at the Gospel Hall. And he'd done a blog and all the rest of it. And I read this blog and I thought, these are the same people. These are the same people. Anyway, it turns out, and I've become good friends with these two lovely, lovely people since, and it turns out that the person [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2228s) did this very weird thing with me, to me, in the mid to late 80s, has been a serial sex offender and paedophile. And he was convicted in 2014\. Wow. It wasn't a custodial sentence. And the reason why it wasn't a custodial sentence is because evidence was falsified, he lied in court, and other survivors' stories were disregarded. And they covered it up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2272s)

And this person was a devout member of the Shanklin Gospel Hall?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2277s)

Oh, he was one of the elders. He was very involved in the My World Youth Group. He was also very involved in a local Shanklin youth club as well. And I have to say, to their credit, and they've been really good because I've been doing a bit of detective work myself, they, as soon as it happened, they were like, "You're out."

But, and I've got screenshots to prove this, this person, and his name is David Gregory, and I'm going to name and shame him because he is a liar and he is a paedophile and he's a sexual abuser. He, even to this day, possibly, but a few months ago on his, oh, what's that thing called? It's a social media, oh, oh, what's it called? It's a, it's a professional kind of networking...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2327s)

LinkedIn.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2331s)

Yes, thank you. Yeah, on his LinkedIn page, he's still got references to his work in the youth club saying that it's really important to give things back to disadvantaged kids. I just... Anyway, so the reason why he didn't get a custodial sentence is because he lied, basically. They all lied. They all cut it up. And this is, this is just appalling.

You know, every church has to have a safeguarding policy. Yes. Right. I contacted 31:8 and I said, "I don't think they've got a safeguarding policy." I said, "They need to have one." Anyway, I managed by doing a bit of detective work myself to get the phone number of one of the elders of this, of the Shanklin Gospel Hall. I don't think he's ever been spoken to by a woman the way I spoke to him because I gave him no quarter.

And I said, "I need to know if you've got a safeguarding policy." "Oh, well, I don't deal with all that kind of stuff. You need to go to Peter Atkinson." And I said, "Well, I don't have his number. I need you to contact Peter Atkinson. I need to see a copy of this safeguarding policy because it is a legal requirement." "Oh, we didn't think it was necessary because we don't have any children in the congregation now."

But you have a convicted sex offender still in your congregation. Have I heard anything from them? Have I heck as like? That's something that's been on the back burner for a while. I mean, we must get back on with that. And to this day, nobody has apologised to the two people whose evidence was not considered enough for a custodial sentence. And what's worse is that one of these people, at least one of these people, has been defamed, publicly defamed by members of that congregation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2457s)

One of the survivors, victims of the abuse?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2461s)

To me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And some of the things, I've got to know these two very, very lovely people. Some of the things that were observed by them made me realize just how naive I was because this is all going on and I didn't even notice a lot of it. Is that this person, Sid, was behaving very inappropriately with young children. Let's just put it like that. There were young teenagers [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2498s) groomed for being elders and all sorts of stuff went on there from what I understand from what this other person has told me. Yeah.

So anyway, so I took this all to the police on the Isle of Wight.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2510s)

Right. I was going to ask about that.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2512s)

Bearing in mind, bearing in mind that my experiences were 20 years before the actual conviction. Yeah. So this person, David Gregory, was a perpetrator [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2528s) many, many years before he was finally caught. And I'm not going to be the only one. There are, there are other survivors out there. There are other victims out there. We know it. But the police were not interested.

Now, instantly, when on the way to work in, oh, a few years ago in Bristol, I was sexually assaulted on the way to work. And I have to say, because of all the experiences I had when I was younger, I just thought, what's the point of, you know, no one's going to believe me. They're going to think I'm a liar. And my friend said, "No, you really have got to report this." So I did. And Bristol, Somerset and Avon police took it really seriously. They, with my reporting and other people's reporting, they built a [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2571s) around this person and they secured a custodial sentence because the behavior, you know, it was indicative of his behavior becoming worse. They took it seriously. Did the Isle of Wight police? No, they were not interested in looking at it at all, even though I was...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2589s)

Why?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2589s)

Because it was explained to me it was to do with resources and I just don't think they were interested, to be honest with you. They told me they were keeping an eye on him. Well, he's in 2014, no, out in 2024 this year. Apparently, he's being taken off the sex offenders register. So how that's keeping an eye on him, I do not know. And I've got an idea. I just started getting really cynical. I just recorded everything. I thought, you know what, quite, he repeated discussion with a police constable [telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2619s) me if I've got a problem with the Gospel Hall and their safeguarding, I have to get in touch with them about the safeguarding policy. And I'm like, they haven't got a safeguarding policy. They are the problem. "Well, there's nothing we can do about it." And it's like, and I'm going to swear, clutch your pearls, for fuck's sake, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2643s)

Yeah, that's the hardest thing, isn't it? It's one thing over many of the issues that we have with the Exclusive Brethren, Plymouth Brethren, is sometimes authorities are very responsive, but sometimes it just feels like they're not listening and you can end up doubting yourself sometimes.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2661s)

That's the thing. I mean, I have to say, you end up gaslighting yourself because you do that so much.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2667s)

Yes.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2667s)

Yeah. And you know, it takes quite a lot of, well, it takes a hell of a lot of therapy and unpacking all this stuff to realize just what the layers of abuse are. And the thing, this is why I mean, one of the things, reasons why I think spiritual abuse is worse than any other kind of abuse is because it takes all of those other elements of like coercion and manipulation and gaslighting and all that stuff, all that stuff. And then they co-opt God as part of it. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2698s) So you end up not being acceptable to all those other people, but also not acceptable for God. Yeah. So it's absolutely, it really is utterly devastating.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2709s)

And that was one thing that we were keen to ask you about, this research into spiritual abuse, because we've all heard of the, what's listed in the coercive control laws of 2015\. And there's, I can't list them off the top of my head, but there's financial abuse, there's sexual abuse, there's emotional abuse. Spiritual abuse isn't on there. No, it isn't. Well, it's only, it's only recent, it's a recent, yeah, recognition, I would say. It needs to be on there. It does. And I would certainly agree from all [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2740s) our experiences. What is your understanding of what it entails? I mean, how would you define it? And I'm trying to put this across to people who may be experiencing it.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2755s)

Okay. But I have a very helpful quote that would be good because people may be, particularly people that are inside our old Brethren lot or maybe even yours that listen to this, and they may be experiencing spiritual abuse but not recognize it as...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2768s)

No.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2769s)

Exactly. And this is one of the real problems with it, is it is, it is, it can be so nebulous. Yeah. And it may not be like happening all the time. There may be some really good experiences, you know, so it can be very, it can be very hard to pin down. But this is a quote, this is one I really love. There are lots of different sort of definitions of it, but this is the sort of state, I think this is the most comprehensive and it's by, um, [Dr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2800s) Lisa Oakley, who is the leading specialist in this area in this country.

Okay. And she says, "Spiritual abuse is coercion and control of one individual by another in a spiritual context." That is the difference. It's because in a spiritual context, the target experiences spiritual abuse as a deeply emotional personal attack. This abuse may include manipulation and exploitation, enforced accountability, yes, censorship [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2830s) decision making, requirements for secrecy and silence, oh yeah, pressure to conform, misuse of scripture or the pulpit to control behavior, requirement of obedience to the abuser, the suggestion that the abuser has a divine position, isolation from others, especially those external to the abusive [context.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2860s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2860s)

Now, I would like to pause there because that just sums up probably what you experienced in your Gospel Hall, but it would certainly be what Ross, Gilli, and I experienced and anybody that left the Brethren. Yeah. And I think if anybody inside the Brethren is listening to that definition you've just given, Sarah, which is really helpful, just stop and think.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2883s)

Yeah, 100%. Stop. And what's it like for all of you three hearing that?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2888s)

Oh, it rings bells. What's that, Gilli?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2892s)

I was also going to say, and it's, I think what makes it even worse is that it's not just like one onslaught or something, it's slowly drip-fed over the years.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2903s)

And you end up not knowing yourself at all. Yeah. You know, and actually in my case, I think a lot of people's cases, if you, because again, with the autism stuff, it's like if you have no idea of who you are, then when spiritual abuse happens, there's not a huge amount of self to take away, but they do. They do. And it actually destroys you. It just, people...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2932s)

And it's interesting what you say, Ross, about it being drip-fed because, and I don't know what it was like in the Shanklin Gospel Hall, but certainly where we came from, we had meetings every night we were supposed to go to. And every night and five times or six times on a Sunday. How many? Five or six. Yeah. So yeah, quite committed. Now I'm in contact with some insiders and the biggest thing, they've stopped going to meetings and the [biggest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2962s) thing that they're saying, "You must come to meetings, you must come to meetings." And I've said exactly that to you because the minute you stop going, you stop being drip-fed that narrative of abuse. And that narrative is saying in our case, Mr. Hales is the only person to believe in, the Brethren is the only right way. And when you're drip-fed that all the time, oh 100%, you believe it. Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2986s)

No, no other, no other church, no other church is okay. They're all of the world. They're all of Satan.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D2994s)

Yeah, all worldly, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=2995s)

It's also right about what you say about, you know, you don't really know who you are, because I'll be quite honest here. I don't know who I am. I've been like 10 years out and I don't know who I am. And that stems from the fact that I left and then got into like a coercively controlling relationship for nine years.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3015s)

And that's really common. That is really common. We call it cult hopping, whether it's kind of like going into a different organisation or into, because you are left incredibly vulnerable. You've got, you've got religious trauma, basically, when you've come out of this kind of situation, you know, and it's, it's a massive problem.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3036s)

Relationships. I'm still trying to find myself, really.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3039s)

Yeah. And that's really important. And actually, that's something I really want to point out, actually, to anybody listening, is that it is not selfish or ungodly to look after yourself. All right. Self-care is not satanic or selfish. It is absolutely essential. And unless you give yourself permission to find out the things that you really like or do, you know, dislike or, you know, all of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3069s) stuff, you are going to be an empty shell of a person.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3073s)

Yeah. And it goes back to the old saying, doesn't it? If you can't love yourself and like yourself, how the hell are you going to love other people?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3082s)

And the thing is, you know, and the Brethren are so selective in the biblical texts they use. Everyone seems to ignore the "love your neighbor as yourself." Now, there's this assumption, isn't there, with that text, that you already have a good relationship with yourself and you know how to care for yourself. Because if you know how to care for yourself, you can care for others. Yeah. That is completely glossed over. The Sermon on the Mount might well never have existed, yeah, for the [Brethren.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3112s)

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3112s)

Sorry, Ross, go on. I presume the Shanklin Gospel Hall was the same as the PBCC where they just cherry-picked different...

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3120s)

Oh, 100%. 100%. I mean, you know, don't get me started.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3125s)

No. It's a bit like what we're saying. I remember Ann, who can't be with us tonight, saying once, you know, somebody described it to her, when you're on an airplane and they give you your safety instructions and they talk about if the oxygen goes, the face mask comes down, you must put the face mask on yourself before you put it on your children. And I think that's a really good analogy, isn't it? Because if you don't put it on yourself and you end up gasping for air, how can you help your children? And I think that's a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3155s) good analogy, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3157s)

That's the thing, isn't it? It's part of the control and it is part of the sucking people in, is that you become, well, they want you to become like a monolith, don't they? They want you to become just part of this sort of like homogenous kind of obedient, I don't know, handmaiden or whatever. It's just, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3176s)

The PBCC, I even have a mantra now that, you know, the elders say, "We'll do the thinking and you do the doing." And that is their mantra.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3193s)

And the other one that was banded around was, "Even if you don't, even if you don't understand it, don't question it."

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3199s)

Yeah. Yeah. You know what? The joy of discovering critical thinking. Oh my word. It's scary, but it's good. I do have a faith. I still, miraculously enough, still have a faith, even though when you're in the various flavors of Facebook Brethren groups, I have been called a lot of different things. Let's put it like that. It just takes you [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3230s) back to all that nonsense beforehand.

But I, I don't know. I've just, I've just started to learn about abundant living. My husband is just, I mean, he's, he's just such a lovely man and he's very committed Christian, but he's not a loony. And I don't, sorry, that sounds a bit derogatory, but you know what I mean. He's kind of like very intelligent. He is, you know, very thoughtful, very compassionate, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3261s) hasn't discarded his brain at the door when he goes to church.

And I've learned so much from him. Just, you know, but even now, even now, I catch myself thinking, oh, you know, maybe they're all, maybe, maybe they are right. Maybe I am wrong. And it's like, I don't think this is ever going to go away completely because it's in there. It is so deeply ingrained. I have to fight really hard to...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3289s)

Yeah, to keep it at bay. And I think that's something in a lot of the stories of people that have left high-control groups as you did and as we all did. I mean, we were all so, we had no, knew nothing else until we left. But that's exactly it. It's so ingrained in your psyche. It's hard to... my internet connection is unstable. Let me swim. Oh dear.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3324s)

Yeah, mine's not great either. Oh well, we'll get there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3328s)

It's so ingrained, that thinking in your psyche, that it's really hard to get rid of. And it's very easy for something to trigger it. And I think it's only with time that you learn to recognize that trigger, acknowledge it, and then push it to one side. It takes a lot of time to do it. You never get rid of the trigger, do you?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3349s)

No, you don't. And I really, yeah, I've experienced quite a lot of that being in these Facebook groups, actually. I didn't really, it just, it's just one thing that's like, yeah, I got called, what did I get called the other day? A worshiper of Moloch. What's that? Well, exactly. A Canaanite, Canaanite god who, ancient Near Eastern god, whatever, who delights in child sacrifice.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3375s)

So for me, I am a member of the Facebook groups, but I've unfollowed all of them so that I never get any notifications. I dip into them when I want to dip into them.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3385s)

Yeah, no, it's a good idea. And it is very, very telling. Some of them, I mean, I've met some really lovely people there. And I would like to say, actually, not everyone who's been in the Brethren church has a terrible experience. There are some people who actually get, you know, actually have got good, healthy congregations to be part of. But there are, there are people, it's so, it's so interesting seeing how people interact. There are people there, particularly men, no offense chaps, but who are very, very [blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3416s) to their own deeply entrenched misogyny. And I feel quite sorry for the admins because I'm calling out a lot of it now. I'm not, I'm not allowing it to happen. That's, I mean, appalling anti-LGBT stuff that goes on in there as well. I mean, it's grim. Whatever your opinion regarding same-sex relationships or trans folk or the rest of it, there are ways of talking about it which are respectful.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3442s)

Yeah, honestly, that's one of the reasons I stepped away from, because I'm LGBT myself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3448s)

So, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3450s)

That's even harder then, isn't it? It's harder to see.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3452s)

And I'm not defending the misogyny at all, but I think, I mean, where we came from, as I'm sure the Shanklin Gospel Hall was the same, it was a very male-dominated world.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3465s)

Oh yeah, 100%.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3466s)

Yeah. And a guy leaving has been brought up from childhood to believe men rule the world because they do in the Brethren church, they rule the world. And we had very much a big thing, you know, the wives, we had this phrase, "be subject," which as you said, referred to your beret. Well, we wore headscarves to show that, you know, we were subject…

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3489s)

Oh you were far more spiritual than us\!

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3491s)

Yeah, we had headscarves, not berets. They were very risky. And it was all about, you know, being subject. And that was part of the reason why I asked when you went to the Shanklin Gospel Hall, how you were seated? Because in the Brethren church, the men would always sit in the front three rows and the women had to sit behind. Well, what message does that give?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3519s)

They weren't, actually. I'm just trying to think about it. That's why I wondered whether it was a similar – it was definitely the men. No, I think they were, actually. I think the men were at the front. Yeah. And I do remember that there were a couple of women who came, one – they must have been visiting the island or something – and they probably didn't come from a Brethren-y type background, but they did have head covering. So one of them stood up to speak. Oh, she was slapped down quickly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3536s)

Yeah, I can imagine. That would never happen in a Brethren church. The only time, looking back on it, I mean, it was our norm, so you just accepted it as norm. But looking back on it, it's bizarre. You always sat behind the men. The only time a woman ever sat anywhere forward of the front was on their wedding day. They were allowed to sit on the front row with their husband-to-be. Is that correct, Ross and Gilli? It was the only time a woman would walk down to the center of the church. And that was it. You always were behind the [men.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3567s) And I just think when you're brought up with that, as a female, you just subconsciously accept that you're a second-rate citizen.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3576s)

And you internalize that misogyny yourself. And actually, that's where the worst misogyny comes from.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3580s)

Yes, from the women. Yeah. And if you're a male, you also have that same thing, you know, that's totally within your thinking. So it must be a hard thing to lose if you've had that for many years. You've got to want to recognise it before you lose it.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3597s)

Yeah, yeah. And some people don't recognise it, do they? But it involves being self-aware. That's right. There is such a lack of self-awareness. It's quite painful, actually. And then there are people there that tell me about autism. Now, I am a published author. I am a published researcher in the field of autism. And these people are telling me to go do my research after having told me that autism is caused by vaccines. Oh, and intestinal worms.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3633s)

Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3637s)

Yeah. You know, I was just going to ask about the, you know, obviously, the sisters sitting behind them. And the other thing was, the only time they could speak up in the meetings was just to give out a hymn. I don't know whether that was the same with your lot or not.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3651s)

I don't think so. I don't think so. No. No, you were there to be seen, not heard, and fondled behind the scenes, basically. I'm sorry to laugh, but I know, I know. But I'm not making light of it. It makes me so angry that there is this coercion and control and all the time, it's utter bullshit hypocrisy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3678s)

So with that in mind, and I totally agree with you, and you're obviously doing quite a lot of research into what spiritual abuse entails and so on. Where do you think this can go? How do you think we can perhaps effect change? Does it come through the law? Will it come through pressure?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3697s)

No, it doesn't come from the law because the law’s useless. The law is an ass, I believe Dickens quoted. Yes. Sorry for having read a book in my life, people. Yeah, anyway. No, honestly, because I'm involved in other sort of like activist groups to do with child sexual abuse and other spiritual abuse groups. And actually, you might as well just bypass the systems that are meant to protect you and help you. And you go straight to reputable media because it's like, it's an utter waste of time. I mean, unless you've got a police force like Bristol, who in my case, I've been very fortunate, they've been, you know, they've been on it. You've got someone like the Isle of Wight, you might as well just curl up and die. They ain't gonna help you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3737s)

That's quite an interesting comment, actually, that you found the difference in the police force. I actually have an experience of Bristol police force in that I had to call them because I was concerned about somebody in our Brethren. And I won't say more than that to protect the person. The police response was phenomenal. They totally got it. They totally got coercion. And I was surprised. So what, and then you've obviously had a positive experience with them and understanding. Why do you think that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3767s) compared to other police forces? I know Abi, for example, hasn't had...

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3772s)

Yeah, I don't know. I mean, we've got, we've got Sarah Crew in charge now. I, I work for, I do some work for an organization called SARSAS, which is the Somerset and Avon Sexual, no, was it Sexual Assault and Rape Support charity. Right. And we work closely with, you know, various organizations and everything. And we've got the chief constable in Bristol now is Sarah Crew and she's really hot on this stuff. She's not taking any prisoners, metaphorically speaking.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3802s)

Yeah. So it depends [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3803s) attitude.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3804s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3805s)

I would agree that comes from the top. It comes from the top, doesn't it? And if you've got somebody in charge of a force that believes this stuff needs to be taken to task, yeah, that will filter down through the force.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3816s)

Yeah. I mean, she's a recent, she's joined the force recently in Bristol, but she's kind of, but even before then, I mean, because, yeah, see the, the experiences with the Brethren feed into other things as well. So my first marriage, I have part of my family who I have nothing to do with now, but were very, very spiritual abuse, spiritual abusers themselves, not Brethren, but very evangelical home educators. Their kids with the same material as the Duggars used in [America,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3847s) you know, that sort of thing. I mean, they were really, they really, yeah, they caused huge division in the family.

Even though the family is in tatters anyway, they pretty much finished it off. And then my son was abused, sexually abused as a young boy in church. So there's this, all this stuff, all these things that have happened. So we had experience of working with even the Somerset police with that, and they were absolutely extraordinary. Yeah, absolutely extraordinary. The perpetrator was given a very long [custodial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3884s) sentence. It was national news and, you know, all of that. And the, yeah, and the church were brilliant. They were brilliant. They really, really, you know, did everything, you know, as much as they could. And yeah, they were very good. So yeah, it's been quite an interesting life, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3902s)

Yeah, it has. And I think, you know, it's interesting, is it, because we've had a lot of tales on these podcasts of sexual abuse within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, you know, that's historical and sometimes current, that's come out. And I always think it's not, these things shouldn't happen. We all know that. And things should be in place to prevent them. But if they have happened, it's then what is done about it. And as you say, the church where your son was responded in a way, they were brilliant.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3930s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D3930s)

Whereas [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3932s) difference we feel with our Brethren church, there's a big carpet and a broom and that's where it all goes.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3936s)

Exactly. And that's the difference, isn't it? I mean, the Shanklin Gospel don't even have a, you know, they don't have a safeguarding policy. They don't need it. It's not necessary. You've got a fucking paedophile in your church. You know?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3953s)

You're saying about the lack of safeguarding policy, and this is just my opinion, but I think the Peebs would be exactly the same if it wasn't for their PR.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3962s)

Oh, I'm sure.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3963s)

If it wasn't for the fact that they're trying massively to improve their public image.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3970s)

Going well, isn't it? Going really well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=3972s)

Yeah, I think you're absolutely right, Gilli. I mean, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church do have safeguarding policies. They've actually, we have had it told to us by insiders that they've recently asked everybody to do a training course on safeguarding. But I think it's probably as a result of what's come out. And whereas that's all well and good, that that's a start in the right direction, A, it's box-ticking, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4002s) it's not going to address the trauma that's been caused historically. They need to own that first and then need to say, how are we going to prevent this going forward? Because there are, I don't like to call them victims, you know, survivors that are still in there and survivors that have left that have had no redress for what's happened.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4021s)

No, and it's like, you know, these organisations are dragged kicking and screaming by legislation to do the right thing rather than actually doing the right thing in the first place. Yes. Yeah. Or doing it because they were actually abused, though, is it happens everywhere. It's not just in Brethren judgment. But I think that in the case of Shanklin Gospel Hall, and I don't know if you would agree with PBCC, yeah, Plymouth Brethren, yeah, them, because it is [independent,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4052s) isolated and has no kind of governing body, if you like, yes, there is far more, far more opportunity for abuse and lack of accountability. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4065s)

Yeah, I mean, I think the Shanklin Gospel Hall, from what you've said, sounds like a smaller entity than even the PBCC. Yeah. And I think the PBCC have been dragged kicking and screaming to conform in certain ways in that, you know, they have to. And the fact that they did have, which is a whole different story, a fairly major charitable investigation over 10 years ago, it meant they had to be seen to have policies in place and so on. But [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4096s) say that, where is the accountability? They can tick boxes, but ticking boxes is no good if it still happens.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4104s)

Yeah, exactly, exactly. It's just a convenience thing. Yes. It's, and you say it's PR and it's performative. Yeah. It doesn't come from a place of true contrition. No, not at all. No. I mean, I know, I know that this particular person, this perpetrator in Shanklin, behaves like he's just got away with it. And that, oh, it's all, it's all happened now. It's all, you know, we've moved on from this. No, your victims, your [victims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4134s) will never move forward from this because of what you've done to them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4140s)

Yeah, they've always got to live with it.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4141s)

How familiar is that?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4145s)

I'm sorry if that's touched on a nerve, folks.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4147s)

No, no, no. But it's exactly the same. You know, someone being found out, whatever, "Oh, we've forgiven them. We'll take them back. We've forgiven them. God's forgiven them."

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4159s)

Yeah, that's right. God's forgiven them, but they also have to face justice.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4162s)

Yeah, exactly. Precisely my point. Hang on, yes, yes, you may have been forgiven if that's, you know, if that's your belief or whatever.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4168s)

Yeah, and now you're marching down to the police station.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4170s)

There's still a justice system that needs to be addressed here.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4174s)

Oh, yeah, 100%. And the other classic phrase is, "God's forgiven them, so you should." That, that was, that's the other one.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4181s)

Oh, no, don't. Don't, don't forgive. I do believe in forgiveness, I do actually, but it's a, it's a process. Yeah. And I'm also a partly trained counselor and it's kind of like, you do a load of stuff like this and it's kind of like, forgiveness is usually done really badly in churches, actually, because people are rushed through this thing. And people don't realize that you have to revisit and revisit and revisit years and years and years after the event. And it's having an attitude of forgiveness which is key. But it's like, yeah, and that forms part of the coercive pattern. This is what is expected. You forgive.

Well, I am not forgiving the Brethren [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4226s) they are not contrite and they are, they, they have not repented. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not forgiving them because they have ruined lives. Yeah, they really have.

Quite a sort of fun fact though is I, I have, and I really hope this for you as well, Ross, is that you can really start finding out who you are, what you like. Because I've really got back into music again. I feel like I'm learning about it. I've missed out on so many decades of music, but I am back in there. I'm going to gigs. I'm getting tattoos. It's great. And I've, I've joined this, I'm getting my nails done. I mean, look. And I, [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4268s) joined this organisation called Rockfit, which is dance music. So basically it's dance exercise, so like Zumba, but to rock and metal, which is hilarious. And the thing is, guess where they're based? Plymouth. Oh, Plymouth. The HQ is Plymouth.

So it's like, and we've got this, and I'll show you the tattoo, I don't even see it. Hang on, where is it? Not a cult. Yeah. So that's one of the things the Rockfit logos, right? And we've got this running joke that we're not a cult.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4304s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4305s)

And the reason why this has become a bit of a running joke is because people have this sort of like still have this mad satanic panic about certain types of music. And the, the leader, the CEO, Hannah, she's, we've nicknamed her Red Leader. And you know, we did that. So we just have this running joke. So anyway, so the point is, it's like I've come from this cultic thing, which is based in Plymouth, [full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4335s) circle to this amazing thing which jokes it's a cult, but it actually isn't. And it's actually very life-affirming. I mean, I could be a Christian in that group without even worrying about being made fun of or, you know, it's incredibly inclusive and we just have a lot of fun.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4360s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4360s)

And my goodness, fun is good.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4361s)

Yeah, I agree it is.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4362s)

It really is. So I really hope that for you, Ross, that you can, you know, and there are loads of LGBT Christians and there are loads of allies that, loads of us are allies, you know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4374s)

Yeah, I mean, I will be quite honest, I have totally lost my faith. I don't even know how I had it in the first place.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4379s)

How understandable is that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4384s)

But yeah, I'm part of a large local LGBT meetup group. We've probably got about 700 members.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4393s)

Fantastic.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4394s)

There's so many, there's so many good people out there. And it's one you should say about music because that's one of my great loves. And one thing I'm doing is I started to collect vinyl.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4403s)

Oh, yes\! Oh my goodness, isn't it cool? I love it.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4406s)

What kind of stuff are you into, Ross? My tastes are really eclectic.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4412s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4413s)

Good tune, I like it, basically.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4415s)

Yeah, awesome. Whereabouts are you in the country?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4418s)

Oh, yeah, I like country, yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4420s)

No, whereabouts are you in the country?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4422s)

Cambridgeshire. Peterborough.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4423s)

Right. We'll go, we'll go for, we'll go to a gig together. Let's go for a gig.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4427s)

This we've got to see. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. But before we close, if it's okay, I would like to go back to the subject of spiritual abuse. And the reason I'd like to go back there, because you've obviously got a certain knowledge about it and you gave that definition of, you know, the one you quoted, the one I'm at least definition. But if somebody was in a high-control religious group, how could you or how would you help them to perhaps recognize the signs that they are being [spiritually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4459s) abused? What would you ask them to look out for?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4462s)

There is quite a lot of stuff. There is some stuff, sort of like checklists as it were, to look out for. Yes. Yeah. Which is actually quite useful if you're allowed to access the internet.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4475s)

I don't know what it's like... Well, yeah, that's debatable. That's another thing. A lot of people inside access these podcasts, so...

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4481s)

Oh, gosh. Insider knowledge. Yeah. No, 100%. Sort of like, you know, look out for sort of people who are, people in positions of authority who are, as you said earlier, cherry-picking biblical verses to make you behave in a particular way according to what they think you should be doing. Yeah. Look out for if you voice any doubts, being shut down. [Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4512s) out for things like being told, "Oh, that didn't happen," yes, when you know it did. You know it did. Look out for that gaslighting because it happens so much. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

You know, look at how, look at how the elders treat other people and how they, how they use their position. Do they use it in a loving family way or do they use it to reinforce their own sense of importance? Do they use, look out for, do they use God to frighten you? Do they use the Bible, do they weaponize the Bible to frighten you?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4566s)

Yeah. I mean, on that point, I am just going to read out a phrase that was actually sent to me by an insider. "Take your Bible and read it every night." Those sorts of things.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4581s)

It's like, you must do this.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4582s)

It's literally a list of instructions. That was number one.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4586s)

That's number one. Take your Bible living in the spirit.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4589s)

No.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4590s)

That is, that's pharisaical, isn't it? And it's controlling. No, because the thing is, we all, you know, particularly if you've got a neurodivergent brain, you know, we, we interact with the world in very, very different ways. And you know, we all, we, we can all pray differently. We can all, I mean, I, I don't read my Bible. I, I can't. I just still to this day can't read my Bible. Yeah. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4620s) will not evangelize because I would not risk bringing somebody into something which I don't quite entirely trust.

I feel really at home with atheists because they're honest and they've gone through that process of thinking, nah. Yeah. And that's, there's an honesty to that. And I do, you know, I'm far more, and you might think it's quite strange when he's autistic who might like want to, you know, go down the rabbit holes. I know all the theology and everything. But these days I am so much happier sitting with uncertainty with all things spiritual. I think we call it, it's [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4662s) the apophatic tradition, not to be confused with apathetic. No, no. Basically, but it basically it's sort of like you, you can sit with the messiness of life and know that God is in there somewhere. And it's okay that you don't know everything because we do see through a glass darkly, but you won't get anyone from the Brethren telling you that because we've got our systematized theology and X, Y, and Z happens and all of that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4694s)

So, yeah, no, that's really interesting about the sort of signs of spiritual abuse. And you know, we've often said a lot of people have left our Brethren group have said about, and I think I mentioned it earlier, the overwhelming strength of fear that's there.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4710s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And financial control as well. That's something else as well. Oh, control. Separating, you know, saying, but sowing seeds of doubt about your family. And then all the awful, awful behavior that goes on, actually physically separating. That is evil. Yeah. Yeah. And I know they, they justify that by, you know, saying, you know, Christ said that I bring a sword to divide. That's just not what it means.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4737s)

Well, that, our old lot justify it by a scripture that I do know, I don't know many, the 2 Timothy 2 talks about departing from iniquity. Yeah. Now, if you look up the definition of iniquity, I think it means evil. And yeah, but of course, their understanding of iniquity is anyone who leaves them or anyone who speaks out against them. And I think, you know, it's been said in previous podcasts, so as soon as they quote 2 Timothy [2,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4767s) uh, not keeping separate. And I always think, well, you know, most of us would actually, or be not, was it, don't be separate? Well, that's right, unequally yoked. But most of us would separate ourselves from things that we don't sit comfortably with us, whether it's evil or not. If it doesn't sit comfortable with us, we would. But it's that complete separation and splitting up of marriages and fathers and sons and mothers and daughters and parents and children and grandparents just because they don't [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4797s) to your church.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4801s)

Yeah. It's mind-blowing. Mind-blowing. It's hideous. Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want to be them the day of judgment, would you? No. Was it, "Whatever you do to one of my little ones, you do to me."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4812s)

Oh, yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4814s)

That's going to go down badly, isn't it? It's going to go down badly, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Not that I believe in hell anymore, but there we are. Yeah. I'm just a complete universalist now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4824s)

Yeah. I mean, I think what's most fascinating and I think, you know, we obviously come from the angle of the PBCC and you come from a very similar experience. And I think what's most interesting for anybody inside the PBCC or anybody in a high-control religious group listening to this is perhaps that realization you're not so unique after all. There are other churches who behave just as you do and it isn't right. The high, a church is good, the high control is not good. And the PBCC is not unique. They're not special. And there is an alternative.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4863s)

Yeah. Yeah. There are alternatives. You know, all faiths and none are out there. Go and find out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go and embrace this wonderful, because it is a wonderful world, actually. The world is not evil. There is some really awful stuff. I mean, we just have to look at the news, don't we? There are some terrible things going on, but there's also some amazing things. Yeah. And God wants you to have abundant life. Yeah. And you do not get it in the Brethren church.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4892s)

No, you don't get it in the Brethren churches. And I think there are some terrible things going on in this world, but equally, from what we've just discussed tonight, there's some terrible things going on in Brethren churches. The thing in the PBCC is when you're in there, you don't know about these terrible things going on because you're not told. No. So you don't know about it.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4913s)

Yeah. And it is, it's evil. It is evil what goes on.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4917s)

And also, you know, out here there's evil, but you know, you've got the whole wide world for it to absorb it. But in there, it's such a close community.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4927s)

Concentrated.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4928s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4929s)

It's horrible. I can't imagine what it's like growing up in it and knowing nothing else. I mean, when I came into it, it was like sort of, I had all this like, you know, … trauma, which made me very vulnerable to, you know, them. But I don't know what it would have been like had I grown up in it. I mean, I just don't know because we all, we know is our experience, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4955s)

Yes, it is.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D4956s)

Yeah. But I can imagine it's very difficult. Yeah. And that's why when people leave, that, you know, this, this, you know, religious trauma is such a, it's a very real thing. Yeah. As you said yourself, Ross. And it's kind of like, you know, that's when people are at their most vulnerable. It's like when a, you know, a person leaves a, you know, sort of like a intimate partner violence kind of [relationship,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4975s) that person is always at the most vulnerable when they're leaving.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4979s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4979s)

Yeah. That's when it's the most dangerous. Yeah. Because they're jumping off a precipice, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4984s)

And that you don't, they don't know where they can land. And it's like that, I think, when you leave these groups as well. But there are mattresses out there to catch you. There are, there are.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=4992s)

There is hope. There is, there massively is hope out there. Actually, there are, there are more organizations in the UK now starting up to sort of help support survivors of spiritual abuse. I know the Catholic Church, the CV, have got this sort of, because I'm having a bit of counseling with them myself, actually. They've got this thing set up. It's not perfect because it's in a church and, you know, safe gardens at the shit show with them at the moment as well. But hey, but there are also independent ones. I'm trying to think, is it Survivors' Voices? Yeah, the Survivors' Voices, there's, yes, run by Jane Cheevers, who's an absolute legend. And gosh, what's the other one? I can't remember, but they are starting to spring up.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5037s)

There's another one that I know called Faith to Faithless.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5044s)

That'd be a really good name for a band. Now there's a thought. I really have gone to the dark side. It's great.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5055s)

Anyway, Sarah, thank you so much for joining us. It's been absolutely fascinating. And I think as much as anything else, it's, it's for us that have only ever known Brethren life up until we, you know, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, Exclusive Brethren life up until we left it, it's quite fascinating to realize that they're not the only ones and the others, isn't leaving them.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5077s)

They're not, but I have to say that, I mean, my experiences, I mean, they were, yes, they were awful. And they think there's no hierarchy of trauma and all the rest of it, but the Plymouth Brethren stuff is off the scale.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5091s)

Yeah, I think it is. And but I do think you're right. I don't think you can put a scale on trauma because no one reacts to trauma. No, it's very personal. And I might react to trauma in a different way to you and Ross and Gilli, but that doesn't lessen it in anybody's eyes.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5109s)

No, it doesn't. I mean, I'm going to be, I'm going to be dealing with this stuff the rest of my life. Yeah. It's always going to be a bit of a monkey on my back, really. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5117s)

I think that's probably the same for all of us, Ross and Gilli.

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D5121s)

Yeah. It's really good that there's these groups and there are survivor groups. That's this, oh, this one, oh, brilliant. What's it called? Theater group called Responsibility Theater. And now who is the, who runs it? She's, she's just put on this play in London called 'I, Lord'. It's all about her experiences in spiritual abuse within the Anglican church. It's absolutely brilliant. And there's this whole sort of like sort of survivors group around this that we, we help sort of co[\-produce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5152s) the production and everything. And you know, the, it's this, it's this kind of sort of creative activism that really, really helps with recovery. I mean, I know Ross, I know you, you're so in that right zone yourself, aren't you, with all your friends and everything, but it really makes a big difference with recovery.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D5172s)

It does. I agree. Yeah, it's really important. Yeah. Thank you very much, Sarah. It's been really interesting chatting to you and especially the definitions of what you've been able to tell about spiritual abuse has been quite eye-opening for me. I don't know if it has for you and Ross. It's quite a good, it's quite a good comprehensive definition, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Douglas**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D5191s)

It is. Definitely. Lisa Oakley, people, if you look up her definition, yeah, of spiritual abuse.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DbXzVx5Z7MS8%26t%3D5197s)

We really appreciate your time this evening and it's been lovely to chat to you. And until next time, see you all soon. [Bye,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5205s) everybody.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzVx5Z7MS8&t=5205s)

Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
