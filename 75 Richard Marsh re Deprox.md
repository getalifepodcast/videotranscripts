## Summary

This is part 2 of the Chicago meeting hall controversy. Episode 74 is part 1.
Links to articles referred to in podcast-
Following the PBCC’s planning disaster in Chicago, they published an unprecedented “ad hominem”  attack on former PBCC member and whistleblower Richard Marsh – who they blamed for their defeat. Here is what they had to say:
"The instigator of the attacks on the Area N project is Richard Marsh, who left the PBCC years ago after he killed a mother of three in a car crash, for which he was criminally charged: Read Story.
The courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar.  He has been sentenced to prison in his home country (England) for his repeated contempt of court.
Click to read the details of the court judgments against Marsh: Decision 1 and Decision 2."
Who is behind these multiple court cases against Richard, and what was the purpose of them?
Is Richard a fugitive from justice? A wanted criminal? A murderer?
Or is this all a desperate attempt to silence a whistleblower who holds the receipts that connect Bruce Hales and his family to a shocking medical scandal?
This episode unfolds a sordid tale of greed and corruption within the PBCC, led by fake “Cambridge Graduate Microbiologist” Warrick Fentiman, and ably backed up by Bruce Hales in person. The King’s Lynn business Specialist Hygiene Solutions (now re-branded as Inivos) launch Deprox, a miraculous new invention that gives a “million-fold reduction” in hospital room germs – but is it REALLY as safe and effective as they claim?
And why would Fentiman and the PBCC spend millions of pounds on court cases in the UK and Canada in desperate efforts to silence a former employee who worked on the Deprox project?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=8s)

So we're going to switch over to part two. This will probably be a separate podcast. We're going to switch over to part two of all of this, which is Richard's rebuttal on everything that they have deemed him as and tried to expose him as this.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=28s)

Convicted liar. What is a convicted liar? Can someone pull that up?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=35s)

We'll go into that. So I guess we start with the Truth About Area N website and see what they're actually saying about me. And then we'll go through it line by line. Okay, so this is the Truth About Area N, so-called Truth About Area N website put out by the Plymouth Brethren, and the very first point they make, the very extraordinary attack they've made, is:

“Myth. The opposition to the Area N development [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=69s) being led by local concerned citizens.”

 They  say that's a myth. Of course, it was, still is, being led by local concerned citizens.

But then facts, this is their facts.

“ The instigator of the attacks on the Area N project is Richard Marsh, who left the PBCC years ago after he killed a mother of three in a car crash for which he was criminally charged. Read story;”

 And it's got a link to a newspaper article. And then; 

“[The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=99s) courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar. He has been sentenced to prison in his home country, England, for his repeated contempt of court. Click to read the details of the court judgments against Marsh, decision one and decision two.”

(Which are links to two online court judgments.)

“Marsh has never lived in nor has any connection to South Barrington. In addition, Marsh often tries to conceal his lies on social media by posting under the fake [name,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=129s) Muhammad Sohail.” 

So this is totally irrelevant, totally irrelevant to Barrington or Area N or whether or not the Brethren should have planning permission. This is what's called an ad hominem attack, which means that it's like “shoot the messenger.” If you can't dispute or rebut what someone has said because it's true, then your only option is to attack the person who's saying it and try [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=159s) discredit the person who's saying it. So when you get this kind of attack, it immediately tells you that the person has said something that they can't rebut. So instead of attacking what the person said, they go for a personal attack against me.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=179s)

Against your character.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=182s)

Yeah, exactly. And they start off, and this really shocked me. I mean, you get used to the nastiness and the unchristianness of the brethren, but that they start off by referring to a tragic car accident I had nearly 10 years ago, as if that has any relevance at all to Barrington planning. So seeing as they've seen fit to drag this up, I'm going to go over it and [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=215s) exactly what happened and what the outcome was of that accident.

Okay, so this is an FDA, that's Federal Drug Administration, I think, USA, drug safety communication relating to a very common antidepressant called Celexa or Citalopram. And you'll notice that the date of this is August the 24th, 2011\. Now, you'll see the [relevance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=245s) of this in a minute. The accident that's referred to in the newspaper article happened on August the 26th, 2011\.

I was living in Regina at the time, and it was a perfect sunny morning, perfect visibility. And I was driving out to a house I'd bought, but we hadn't yet moved into. (It was still being worked on) At about eight o'clock in the morning, I was driving on the range roads, on the gravel roads, and the house I had bought was the other side of the main north-south highway, a busy highway that [goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=287s) due south out of Regina.

I remember I was driving on the road and I could see the highway in front of me, maybe a quarter of a mile away, and I remember a sensation of dizziness, and then I don't remember anything else. The next thing was I came around, I returned to consciousness and my car was completely smashed up and I was bleeding and I was the other side of the highway and I'd obviously been in a major collision. And tragically, as the Brethren kindly point out, I had crossed the highway, I'd had a 90-degree collision with a car traveling at high speed on that busy highway and the person in the other vehicle passed, they died.

So of course the police, the ambulance, they turn up and I was breathalyzed and tested, I was taken to hospital, I had minor injuries and I had no idea how this could have happened. Anyone who knows Regina knows the prairies, there's no trees, the roads are raised, the visibility is perfect. You can see cars coming 10 miles away practically. And so I was completely baffled. I had no idea how this had happened. Usually if there's an accident, it's caused by poor visibility, fog, snow, ice, alcohol, someone being on their phone. There was no alcohol. There was no phone. I didn't even own a cell phone at the time.

The facts were that I had simply driven with full visibility straight onto, at relatively [low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=403s) speed. I was only traveling at about 40 kilometers an hour straight into a busy highway and collided with cars moving at 100 kilometers an hour on the highway. So I was terribly, terribly distraught. You know, survivor's guilt. I didn't know whether I was actually at fault, whether I had actually done something stupid and then the impact to my head had made me forget what had happened. My only memory was seeing the highway ahead of me and then nothing else, a complete gap in my memory until I came to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=445s) other side of the highway in this smashed up vehicle.

So the RCMP interviewed me and then they didn't take any further action. And I assumed that, you know, after a year, I hadn't heard anything more from the RCMP. I assumed that they had closed the case. And at that point, this was back in, what year was it again?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=476s)

2011\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=478s)

Yeah, this is back in 2011\. We were sent back, Bruce Hales sent us as a family back to the UK. So we were no longer living in Canada. A year after the accident, we moved back to the UK. And then four years later, when I'd been living in the UK and after I'd left the Brethren, the RCMP suddenly decided, or rather the public prosecution in Saskatchewan, suddenly decided they wanted to prosecute me for this accident. So I had to go back to Regina and I was kind of formally arrested, had to go and appear in court, which is what the newspaper article says. It just says, you know, he's appeared in court. He's been charged with causing death by dangerous driving. And it was a bail hearing. So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=525s) got bail.

So then I got myself a lawyer. And the lawyer said, well, look, you've hardly got enough money to cover this. I'll do what I can with the funds you provided, but you're going to have to do the bulk of the research around your case. So I started to look into my medical history because it seemed to me, from my recollection, it seemed that I had lost consciousness at some point. And I came across, so I went through a medical history, looked at the drugs I was on at the time, and I was on a very high dose of antidepressant because I was under extreme stress, being a member of the Brethren, and things were going badly sideways in Regina at the time.

I was on citalopram, 60 milligrams, which is like the highest dose you could have at the time. And then when I, this is four years after the accident, I'm researching it and I look up citalopram and I come across this FDA drug safety communication, which is kind of like a recall. And what it's saying is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is informing health care professionals and patients that the [antidepressant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=605s) Celexa, citalopram hydrobromide, should no longer be used at doses greater than 40 milligrams per day because it could cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart.

So reading on through the article, what it says is that they found that people who are on the 60 milligram dose could get a heart arrhythmia, which is where your heart starts beating irregularly and the [immediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=636s) effect of that, I mean if you get a serious heart arrhythmia, it can kill you. If you have a mild heart arrhythmia, the first thing it does is it drops your blood pressure right down and it causes you to faint or lose consciousness. So this change to the regulations, this drug safety notice, literally was issued two days before the accident.

So I looked into it and when you read through the rest of the article, it says that people who have a condition called long QT syndrome are particularly susceptible to the effect of, you know, to be given a heart arrhythmia by taking this drug. The QT interval is the distance between the little ripples on an ECG, electrocardiogram. And it's kind of the time it takes for your heart to reset itself between the two stages of the beat, when one ventricle contracts and then the other ventricle contracts.

And so my lawyer said, well, look, let's get you tested and see if you've got this long QT interval that would make you susceptible to this. So I had an ECG and they put the little electrodes on your chest and measure it and sure enough, I had the long QT interval, which is exactly the thing that [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=733s) say very specifically on this drug, do not give it to people who have a long QT interval.

So we put all the data together, this notice, my medical records, the ECG, what the doctor said about the ECG, and gave it to the public prosecution. And they came back and said, well, we don't want to prosecute you anymore. It never even went to trial. They canceled the trial. And I forget the legal term for it, but yeah, I was just discharged, you know, acquitted. Yeah. You're free to go back to the UK because the evidence was so strong that I'd lost consciousness because I was taking too high a dose of the antidepressant. And I had a preexisting heart condition that made that a lot more serious than it would otherwise have been.

So it never went to trial and for the Brethren to put this out, to say he's been criminally charged, and then put a link to a newspaper article saying, you know, Richard Marsh has been charged. But when the Brethren knew perfectly well that it never went to trial, when the Brethren knew perfectly well that I was acquitted and found not to blame for this accident, when the Brethren knew that this whole thing had happened [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=829s) of a medical condition that had rendered me unconscious. So at the point of the collision, before I'd even got to the road, I was actually unconscious in my vehicle.

And then to try and use it against me as if that's some crime that then means that what I say about the Chicago meeting room is somehow untrue, is just so unchristian and so dishonest. And it's so much, I mean, this is a terrible, horrible, tragic thing that [happened.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=859s) And it had a huge impact on my own life and family and far more so on the family of the person that was deceased. And yet the Brethren are going to use this as a kind of a... They're grasping at straws. Grasping at straws, but it's also cruel and immoral and dishonest. So unchristian-like. Utterly unchristian. So, you know, that's all I want to say about that. You know, I still have to live every day with what happened, and it still affects me. But it is not relevant to anything to do with the Chicago Brethren, the meeting room, or what I may choose to say about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=907s)

All the charges against Richard were dropped when medical records and an ECG showed that an overdose of citalopram combined with a pre-existing heart condition likely caused him to have a blackout while driving.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=922s)

Okay, so the next points that the Brethren see fit to make;

“ The courts have confirmed that Marsh is a liar. He has been sentenced to prison in his home country for repeated contempt of court.”

 Okay, so now to explain this, we have to start and give a whole load of background around why I left the Brethren and why these court cases were taken against me. So yeah, if we can go back [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=952s)…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=952s)

Let's just reiterate to the PBCC that the reason why we have to go into this is they're the ones that have brought this up. And so this is Richard Marsh's rebuttal into the lies that they are spreading. They're spreading misinformation and it needs to be, it needs to be cleared up. So with that comes Richard's story. Yep.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=973s)

Okay, so this is a video about a product called Deprox. It's a hospital decontamination machine, and this is really where my story of leaving the Brethren started. And this is where all these court cases that the Brethren are referring to, these all originate from this company and this machine. And the reason that it's relevant to me is that I worked for this Brethren[\-owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1003s) business.

And so in order to understand my story, you need to understand a little bit about what this machine is and what it does. And this is an Australian video about the machines being used in Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia and yeah, just listen to the video and you'll understand what a Deprox machine is and what they're claiming that it can do.

### **9 News Australia Presenter**

“New technology is set to revolutionize the way hospitals deal with the growing problem of superbugs. An Australian hospital is leading the way in protecting the most vulnerable patients, including newborn babies.

### [**Gabriella Rogers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1047s)

Riley Maloney is a little survivor, so too his twin brother Axel. Both were born three months early after their mum Leslie went into premature labor. 

**Leslie Maloney**

Just seeing them, they were just so tiny and so fragile and that in itself is just so traumatic. Westmead's neonatal intensive care unit has been their home for 49 days. Little lives here not only hang in the balance, their fragile immune systems make them more vulnerable to germs that are resistant to [antibiotics.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1078s)

### [**Dr Mark Tracey**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1078s)

If you look at our intensive care unit, there are surfaces everywhere that are almost impossible to clean.

### [**Gabriella Rogers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1085s)

This is the latest weapon in infection control. This automated machine emits vapors of hydrogen peroxide into the air, blasting bacteria and decontaminating a room in a matter of hours.

### [**Kathy Dempsey**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1098s)

We're now able to reduce environmental contamination far beyond what we could normally do.

### [**Dr Mark Tracey**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1105s)

This million-fold reduction in bacterial load lasts up to six months.

### [**Gabriella Rogers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1111s)

It's also very safe. The room is cleared while all vents and doors are sealed as the machine goes to work. About one in three babies, which weigh less than one and a half kilos, will get an infection in their bloodstream, which is why hygiene is so important. And because the machine is mobile, other parts of the hospital can also benefit. It's so important to just make sure that they're in the safest environment that they can be in. Gabriella Rogers, [Nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1141s) News.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1142s)

Okay, so that's all very impressive, wonderful new technology. And just want you to note one point, a one million-fold reduction in bacterial load. So this Deprox machine was marketed, basically built and marketed by a Plymouth Brethren member called Warwick Fentiman and his brother Mark, who set up a business called Specialist Hygiene Solutions in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1172s) UK town of Kings Lynn. And when I was sent back from Canada by Bruce Hales in disgrace in 2012, I ended up working for Hygiene Solutions and working on their Deprox device.

Now, by that point, they'd been marketing this for about seven or eight years, and they were working very, very closely with the Hales’s in Sydney. [In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1202s) fact, it was Bruce Hales who told Warwick Fentiman to get into the hygiene business. Now, the reason I bring this up is that it's very relevant to the story, that this business was very deeply entwined with the Hales family at the highest level, which explains why things went the way they did.

So this is the Deprox trademark, and this is the trademark in Australia was registered by Gregory Jay Hales, who is Bruce Hales' son. So this is a copy of the Hygiene Solutions [website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1241s) from around 2012\. This is their contact page, and they show three addresses. One of them is in Kings Lynn, which is where I was working. One of them is in the USA, and the third one is significant. It's their Sydney address, which is where the machines working in the Westmead Hospital were operated from. And that is 123 Bowden Street, Meadowbaank, New South Wales, 2114 Sydney.

Now, if we look up that address, we find a planning application for 123 Bowden Street, Meadowbank, and it shows that the owners of that location are B.D. Hales and J.J. Hales. So in Sydney, Australia, Hygiene Solutions and this amazing Miracle Deprox device were actually operating. Their address was actually Bruce and Jenny Hales' [address.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1304s) And this location, 123 Bowden Street, was actually Bruce's personal office until their new Archway House building was built, and then he moved into Archway House. So this was actually Bruce's personal office address.

So this is the Deprox machine, the one you saw in the video earlier. And the way it works, I'm just going to go over it again, the way it works is it pumps a vapor, a fog of disinfectant, into a hospital room, which will then touch all the surfaces and disinfect them all. And what they claim in their literature repeatedly is that it gives a million-fold reduction in the number of germs. Now, it's [true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1356s) that it is capable of doing this, but in order to achieve that million-fold reduction, it has to achieve a certain concentration of disinfectant in the air. It needs to achieve a concentration of 80 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide in the air and hold it there for the best part of an hour, and that will actually give the million-fold reduction they claim.

Now, the machine has internal settings on it that [limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1387s) the concentration. So it'll pump the disinfectant out until it reaches a certain preset limit, and then it will stop pumping and just let the disinfectant do its work. And the setting that these machines should have been set at, or the setting that they used to be set at, should we say, was a setting which they call the RH setting, an RH of 30\. Now, what had happened in the years prior to, up to about 2014 [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1418s) that these machines were set at RH30. They were disinfecting to a reasonable standard, but the operators were complaining of, increasingly complaining of sore throats and respiratory illnesses, and in particular, serious nosebleeds that they couldn't stop, and some of them that actually got like chronic coughs and chronic respiratory problems.

When I started [working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1448s) for Hygiene Solutions, they were frantically trying to deal with this problem of respiratory damage to operators. Now, the reason for the respiratory damage was very clear, and that is, when you fill a room with hydrogen peroxide at 80 parts per million, you then have the problem of getting rid of that hydrogen peroxide before an operator can re-enter the room. Hydrogen peroxide naturally breaks down over time, so if you were to leave a room for say 24 hours, all that hydrogen peroxide would have broken down into water and oxygen and the room would be safe to enter.

But because time in hospital wards is very valuable [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1491s) because competing systems could decontaminate a room in say a couple of hours, they told operators that it was safe to re-enter the room 45 minutes after the process had stopped. Now the only reason they got away with this is that hydrogen peroxide has no smell, it has no taste and it has no immediate, obvious impact on your health. It's not a cumulative poison, but it has a cumulative effect. So if you walked into a room with say 20 parts per million hydrogen peroxide, you might notice a slight choking sensation, but you would be fine. If you did that every day, every working day for a year, you would have very, very severe damage all the way down your windpipe and into your lungs, and you would be subject to [chronic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1546s) nosebleeds and chronic throat infections and sore throats.

But it's not readily detectable. And there is such a thing as a hydrogen peroxide meter, but they're very expensive and very hard to find. It's a very specialist field. So Hygiene Solutions were just blatantly overriding all the safety regulations. In order for it to be safe to re-enter the room, the hydrogen peroxide concentration has to be down to two parts per million. So they've got to get it from 80 parts per million down to two, and what was actually happening is that after 45 minutes, the level would have dropped to about 20 parts per million. In other words, it would be [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1593s) times the safe limit.

So they were making a fortune. These machines were incredibly popular. They were selling them, you know, they were operating in Australia, they were operating them in New Zealand, they're operating them in about 60 hospitals in the UK, but they were suddenly getting more and more letters and I think somewhere I've got a copy of a letter. So here's an example. So when I joined the firm, I found this letter which is from a doctor's surgery and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1623s) is 2015 and it says,

 "Dear Miss Cook," 

(and I've blanked out names because it's personal information,) 

"Miss Maria Blank, date of birth 31st October 1975\.

"Maria has given her permission for me to write this letter to request details about the nature of the cleaning machine to which she was exposed and also clarification of the chemical used and their possible side effects if inhaled. This information may be of use in her ongoing management. Kind regards." 

So this is a letter from a doctor to Hygiene Solutions via their subcontractor who was operating machines at a particular hospital saying, "Look, we've got a cleaning staff member with, you know, chronic respiratory problems. What has she been breathing? What is your machine putting out into the air?" And this was just one of many, many complaints that were increasingly coming in from people operating these machines.

So what did Hygiene Solutions decide to do? [Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1695s) there was a very simple fix, and this is the fix they took. They turned down the concentration of the disinfectant to about a sixth or an eighth of what it actually should have been. So now it was safe to re-enter the room after 45 minutes, but the concentration of the disinfection when it was disinfecting was [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1725s) 80 parts per million as it needed to be to disinfect the room. It was only about 20 parts per million. These are the receipts, these are the actual emails that were going around at the time.

So they turned down all the machines, so instead of being the RH setting being 30, they turned it down to an RH setting of 5, which equates to about 20 parts per million, which is completely inadequate. It's not going to give you a million-fold reduction. It's going to kill some of the germs, but nothing like the level that's needed. So to give you an analogy, imagine you're disinfecting babies' bottles and you have to put six teaspoons of bleach into a gallon of water to [disinfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1769s) those bottles. But you find that that bleach mixture is irritating your skin, so you decide, okay, I'm just going to put one teaspoon of bleach in a gallon of water. Okay, it won't irritate your skin so much, but it also won't disinfect the bottles. You've diluted the disinfectant far too much to be effective.

So this is exactly what they were doing. It was as simple as that. And the reason they could get away with it again is because the hydrogen peroxide has no smell. It's invisible. It's an invisible [gas.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1799s) There's no way for the hospital to know that these machines have actually been turned down to a very, very low level and that they were no longer disinfecting the room. Now of course then the question is, the problem is, what if the hospital actually decides to do some testing? What if the hospital does some swabbing after the process and finds out that the room is still contaminated?

So here's an email that was, so this is in 2014, and they turned all the machines down to five instead of 30 at this point, but this hospital, Papworth Hospital, which is a cystic fibrosis hospital, they were going to do some swabbing. They were actually going to test the room after it had been Deprox cleaned to see if there were germs remaining. This is the email about it.

"Just to confirm for tomorrow, they will be doing extensive swabbing of the environment. Could we therefore use two Deprox systems set at [RH30?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1860s) Thanks for your help."

So what they would do is when they knew the hospital was going to do testing, they would turn the machines up and they would, either Warwick Fentiman or one of their Brethren employees would go and do the clean themselves and they knew to at the end of the process, they would enter the room and they would hold their breath and open the doors and then walk out again and not [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1890s) inhale any of the poisonous vapor.

But if you go on to the next emails, you can see what they were doing with the other hospitals. So this is kind of halfway through the crisis. 

"Hello both, Sherwood Forest 4 machines are now at 10 RH as a safety precaution."

 So these ones they've turned them down from 30 to 10 as a safety precaution because the vapors were affecting the operators. And the next email. So these are two more emails.

 "Hi Mark, just receive your message. I've instructed the team to change all machines in the service area to RH5 with immediate effects."

 And again, that's one-sixth of the level it needs to be.

And another email. 

"Has this been sorted? Just a reminder, all systems used at Worcestershire hospitals, including Redditch, Royal Worcester and Kidderminster, should be set at RH5. Many thanks, Mark Fentiman."

So they [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1954s) about 200 machines. And these were operating every day in hospitals in Sydney, Australia, in Auckland, New Zealand and right across the UK. And each machine was probably doing two or three cleans a day. They were all turned down to RH5 and they were no longer disinfecting the rooms. But the hospitals were not told.

So this is a situation I came into. And I was absolutely horrified because imagine, take that first [scenario.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=1985s) They're disinfecting premature baby intensive care units. And as they say, those premature babies, their lives hanging on a thread. They're very, very susceptible to an infection from the environment. So instead of cleaning the room manually with bleach, which is the normal procedure, they had substituted this Deprox machine, believing that it was giving a million-fold reduction in the number of germs in that [intensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2015s) care unit.

In fact, by 2015, those machines had been turned right down, so they no longer gave a decent level of disinfection. They gave about maybe a tenth to a twentieth of the level of disinfection that the hospital staff believed they were giving. And this is life-threatening. This is not just a commercial fraud because [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2045s) were ripping off to the tune of millions of dollars, UK hospitals, hospitals around the world that were sucking money out of the national health systems for decontaminations that hadn't actually happened because the rooms weren't being decontaminated. But far more seriously, it was a huge threat, life, an existential threat to the patients in those hospitals.

I'll give you another example. One of the things that the machine was heavily promoted [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2075s) was a disease called Clostridium difficile, C. difficile.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2079s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2080s)

Which you've probably heard of. It's an infection that you normally only get in a hospital. It kills maybe 30,000 people every year just in Europe and it mostly affects older people. And when you get C. difficile, it's like extremely bad stomach flu. It's like stomach flu on steroids and it gives you this very violent diarrhea and the bacteria goes through your body and it sheds from your skin and with the diarrhea, it contaminates everything. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2111s) if a patient gets C. difficile, they're put in an isolation ward, they're put in a side ward with its own bathroom and you know, 10-20% of them die, they don't make it.

And you know, if they recover, they're moved out and then they've got this very, very heavily contaminated side ward and of course particularly the bathroom is very, very contaminated with C. difficile germs, and it's spread by contact with the environment. So people catch C. difficile by [touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2141s) a contaminated surface, you know, a tap, a toilet seat, a wall, a bed rail. So they had an epidemic of this in the UK, and, you know, hundreds of people were dying in the UK in hospitals through C. difficile epidemics.

Deprox was marketed very heavily for doing a terminal clean on a C. difficile patient's isolation room. So when they would wheel the patient out, instead of doing a proper clean with bleach in that room and in that bathroom, they would wheel in one of these machines, turn it on, it would blow its vapor, and then two hours [later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2178s) they would, you know, untape the door, take the machine out, and then they would put the next patient in, believing that room was sterile, that all the germs had been killed. Well, in fact, the room was still heavily contaminated. And the fatality rate for C. difficile is something like 20%. So it's inevitable. You do the figures, you do the statistics, how many cleans they were doing, how many machines there were. People were catching diseases and dying as a result of this fraud.

So I worked for this company for about three months and one of their non-Brethren employees approached me and he said, "I've got a moral dilemma." He was a Lithuanian guy. He didn't speak very good English, but he confided in me because he was obviously feeling very guilty about his part in all this. And, you know, he just wanted someone to talk to. And he [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2240s) to me exactly what was going on. And, you know, it wasn't even really concealed because once he had told me, I did my own research and I had access to all the company's computer systems and all the records.

And, you know, I had their own testing data, books of their own testing data, and it all fully confirmed everything that I'd been told, that the whole fleet of machines, 200 machines, had been turned down to [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2271s) level of RH5. And I even had the complete fleet report, like a whole stack of pages with a line for every machine showing what setting it was on. There was no doubt about it. There were piles of receipts. There was piles of evidence.

So this for me was a massive sort of crunch point. This was the point where I suddenly realized that the whole Brethren system was corrupt because this guy was very closely associated with Bruce Hales. He was having weekly Zoom calls with the Hales boys developing this whole project. That was happening, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2317s) it was making them a mint of money. He was kind of Bruce Hales' poster child for, you know, being a really cool Brethren business guy. So I kind of knew that because the Hales’s were involved, there was no way this was going to be dealt with properly. I knew that because the Hales’s were involved, it would be a massive cover up.

So I kind of dismissed the idea of, I'm just going to take it to my local priests and let them deal with it, which, of course, is what you're supposed to do if you find fraud in a Brethren business. So I wrote a report. It was about a 10 or 15 page report, which you can find online under Freedom of Information. And this is the first paragraph of that report. And I'm going to read it out. This report was sent to the Health and Safety Executive and to the Medical Goods Regulation Authorities. And it was sent to as many NHS hospitals that were using the machine that I could find email addresses for.

“Deprox Safety and Efficacy, a serious public health issue.”

 And then it's an abstract, so it just starts off with a summary of what it's about. 

“Point one, the Hygiene Solutions Deprox hospital disinfection process does not achieve the claimed level of disinfection. Point two, residual hydrogen peroxide concentration on completion of the process is dangerously high. Consequently, vulnerable persons, possibly [including](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2412s) patients in intensive care, are being exposed to environments and equipment that have previously been used by dangerously infectious patients and not fully disinfected.

Hygiene Solutions employees and NHS domestic staff are regularly exposed to hydrogen peroxide levels well in excess of the safety limit. Patients, including cystic fibrosis patients with compromised respiratory function, moved into freshly Deproxed rooms are being exposed to excessive levels of hydrogen peroxide vapor. Competing businesses are losing revenue unfairly due to misrepresentation on NHS tender proposals. The NHS is spending large sums of money on Deprox processes and machines, which funds could have been used for more effective decontamination equipment or other healthcare initiatives. It is quite possible that NHS patient morbidity and or mortality have occurred as a result and may continue to occur unless the machines are recalled.”

So basically, we've got two scams. They started off with one fraud and then they switched it to another fraud. So you have to kind of keep this in mind that fraud number one was up to 2015\. Yes, the machine did decontaminate, but the operators were being exposed to 10 times the safe level, the legal level of hydrogen peroxide when they used it. After 2015, it was safe to enter the room after a process, but the rooms [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2506s) the equipment were not being decontaminated because they were only putting in a tiny fraction of the amount of disinfectant that was needed.

So I sent this report and I also copied it to local priests and, you know, it was kind of like burning the house down as you walk out the door because I knew there was no way, you know, the Brethren weren’t going to withdraw from me because of this, because you don't do that. You don't report to the authorities on the Brethren, regardless of how evil their crime is. Just in the same way as they cover up for pedophiles, they will very happily cover up for fraud, even if it's a fraud [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2545s) endangers human life.

So this was, you know, obviously I got withdrawn from. And then I set up a website called DeproxFraud, in which I laid out all the information, all the details, all the photographs. And I mean, this is a very big and complex issue. There were lots of other issues with the machines. And I had lots of receipts, I had lots of paperwork, I put it all online. And of course, I didn't realize quite how closely the Hales’s were connected [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2579s) the business. I didn't realize that Bruce and Jenny Hales owned the address it was running out of.

So I didn't quite expect the level of reaction from the Brethren and from Hygiene Solutions that I got, it was ferocious. They got lawyers, they got everyone after me. I mean, there's a whole different story. That's going to be a whole book and a series of podcasts. But I mean, in hindsight, the reason they were so desperate to shut me up was not just because it would shut down a valuable Brethren business. It's because [Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2616s) Hales was directly implicated. And because they had this lovely video of premature baby intensive care unit making this claim of a million-fold reduction and I had the receipts that could prove that they weren't doing any such thing.

So anyway, just before we move on to the next section, I just want to give you a little bit of an insight into Warwick Fentiman. His full name is Warwick Fentiman and he's the mastermind or the master criminal behind this whole thing. So this is an article in the Worcester News. Worcester is one of the hospitals they were using and this is in 2012 at the height of the, you know, when they were really expanding in Australia, in the UK.

**Worcester News Article**

“A new weapon in the war on germs, 5th of November 2012,  
Cutting-edge decontamination devices help bring an outbreak of the winter diarrhea and vomiting bug norovirus under control in super quick time. The Deprox device, about the size of a domestic bin, releases hydrogen peroxide vapor into the air, killing all germs in that part of the hospital while the unit is in operation. The units, created [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2697s) Hygiene Solutions, work by misting or fogging which kills strains of flu, norovirus, Clostridium difficile and MRSA.”

Now listen to this next line. 

"Cambridge graduate microbiologist Rick Fentiman, the company's technical director, said there's a lot of evidence to support the fact it can reduce outbreaks by half the time it takes to manage an outbreak using traditional methods." 

**Richard Marsh**

Now take note of this line, Cambridge graduate [microbiologist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2728s) Now, Warwick Fentiman is an ordinary peeb. I knew him as a child. He grew up in the next locality. I'm not even sure he attended high school because he was of that generation that was kind of homeschooled. He certainly did not attend Cambridge University. He certainly does not have any qualifications, let alone graduated as a microbiologist. In fact, from my personal conversation with him, I suspect he [knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2758s) very little about microbiology at all.

But anyway, just to prove the point, if we move on to the next slide, I emailed Cambridge University to say, you know, did this guy actually graduate as a microbiologist? So this is the Cambridge University Student Registry.

 "Dear Mr. Marsh,

Re Rick/Warwick Fentiman, date of birth 23rd of August 1985\. 

Further to your email of 17th of November [2016,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2788s) I'm writing to say that we've been unable to find any record of the above named as having been registered as a student at this university under the spelling of the names or with the date of birth provided. If you have any further information, we'll be happy to recheck our records accordingly. Best wishes, David McCarthy, Student Registry Administrator."

I mean, of course, I knew he didn't, but if you've got to prove this to the NHS, you need to have the receipt. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2818s) I took the time to get the receipt. And so I also, I mean, there was just one other possibility, one other mitigating circumstance, maybe the journalist had just, you know, assumed that this guy was a microbiologist. So I phoned up the journalist and had a long conversation with them and he says, "No, I've got all my notes. This was based on an interview with Rick Fentiman, and he said he was a Cambridge graduate [microbiologist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2849s)"

So this is 2012 when the original article was published. You know, this is before everything blew up. This was before I got involved with the company. The guy is already going out, selling medical equipment to 60 or more NHS hospitals, and in Australia and in New Zealand, claiming to be a Cambridge graduate microbiologist when he has no such qualifications. So this is the guy who subsequently sues me for libel.

Let's start with the libel trial which went against me and this is the basis of their claim. “The court has proved that Mr. Marsh is a liar.” So I set up this website called deproxfraud.info which got a very high level of views. It was very, you know, a lot of people were reading it and I kept it regularly updated. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2909s) Specialist Hygiene Solutions spent a lot of effort legally trying to get it shut down and because of, you know, freedom of information, they couldn't actually get the website host to take the site down.

And then, and this is at a point I'd moved back to Canada. I was living in Regina. So this is September the 25th, 2017\. This is a couple of years after I'd made my report and left the company. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2940s) was actually in, and for anyone who knows Regina, the Cornwall Center, the shopping center in the middle of Regina. I was in the Hudson's Bay store, and suddenly my phone made a funny bleep, and it came up with a kind of a gear wheels symbol on the screen and sort of stopped working completely. It just showed this gear wheels thing and then it shut down altogether. It's really weird.

Anyway, when I got home from my shopping expedition, I found out that [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=2970s) my social media and all my websites were successively being shut down by some mysterious external entity. So this is the timeline. And the reason I can give the timeline is that when someone logs into your Twitter, your Facebook, your LinkedIn from a new device, the social media company, Facebook or Twitter, sends you an email and says, "Someone has logged into your device. IP address. Was this you?" 

Okay. So all these, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3000s) email was filling up with all these notifications from social media providers. And this is the order of it.

So 13:13, my Twitter account had a new login from Kings Lynn in Norfolk. Kings Lynn is where Hygiene Solutions is, where I was working. I was in Regina, Canada. Someone in Kings Lynn had logged into my Twitter account. 

At 13:40, a few minutes later, my Facebook password was reset, so I [could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3030s) no longer get onto Facebook.

 At 13:47, my Twitter password was reset. I could no longer get onto my Twitter account. And bear in mind, I was using all this social media to post about the Hygiene Solutions problems.

 So 13:54, my Twitter email address was changed, like the reset email, so I could no longer use the email to change the password back.

At 14:34, my WordPress, which is like the host for my deproxfraud.info, my website about Hygiene Solutions, the email address was changed. 

At 15:22, my Vimeo account was deleted. 

At 15:23, my Gmail account got a [security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3079s) alert. It had been signed into from a BlackBerry device in the UK. Now, who uses BlackBerry devices? They all use BlackBerry devices. No one else did because they were obsolete. 

Okay, 18:31, my Dropbox account was accessed from a very obscure village called Terrington St Clement in Norfolk. Now note that name, Terrington St Clement. It's a tiny and obscure village. At 19:33, a new email address, rubbish@saskel.net, was added to my LinkedIn account.

The next morning, September the 16th, well, say next morning, but at 1:58, the Romer Photonics, that was my little optics business, company page was removed from LinkedIn, and very significantly at 5:16 my Facebook account was logged into from another very obscure village, Whittlesford in the UK. 

So this is an example. So new login to Twitter from Safari and you can see the date. We noticed a recent login to your account @richardmarsh197. Location Kings Lynn, England.

Now Kings Lynn is where Hygiene Solutions is. It's the locality. It's where the Fentimans live and it's where the business premises is. Now remember there was a login from Terrington St. Clement, which is a tiny village six miles outside of Kings Lynn. Hygiene Solutions changed their name to Inivos. So Inivos is Hygiene Solutions. Inivos is owned by Warwick Fentiman. If we Google Terrington St. [Clement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3188s) and Inivos, here's an example of what comes up.

“SciChem are looking for a warehouse manager to join our growing team and wider business unit, Inivos Scientific. This role will be based in our warehouse outside of Kings Lynn in Terrington, St. Clement.”

 So you've got people logging into my social media from Kings Lynn, you've got people logging into my social media from Terrington, St. Clement, which happens to be a Hygiene Solutions location, and you've got people logging into my account from Whittlesford. Now to explain the Whittlesford one, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3225s) think there's a video, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3229s)

This is my webmail page for the 26th of September 2017\. We have here a login alert from Facebook and a password change alert from Facebook. Both of these alerts come from security at facebookmail.com, which is the correct email address for Facebook security alerts. We open the first one. Your account was logged into from an unrecognized browser or device, was this you? Location is near Whittlesford, United Kingdom. I was in Canada at the time, so it certainly wasn't me, and Whittlesford is the location of Granta Processors.

**Richard Marsh**

We review the login, we get direct your Facebook page [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com), no [question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3286s) is the authenticity. Now if we go on to details, we're given the IP address that was used to make the login, which is 81.130. We highlight the IP address, search Google for that IP address, and immediately we have Granta Processors. Click on the specific IP address again, 81.130.1941, and we have Granta Processors.

Now if we go back to my webmail, back to the inbox, and now we open the Facebook password change which was later on the same day, again we have 81.130.1941, and we can copy that IP address, open a Google page, [trace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3363s)myip.org and again we have grantaprocessors.com. So there's absolutely no doubt whatever that someone from Granta Processors logged into my Facebook account on the 26th of September and then subsequently logged in again and changed my [password.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3393s)

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3395s)

Okay, so the significance of Granta Processes is that it's a Brethren-owned business, and it's more than that. It's owned by Roger Marsh, who is my cousin, and was the leading Brethren computer guru in the UK at the time. This was just when Brethren were in the process of introducing WordEx computers, Streamline computers, and Roger was right at the spearhead of that, and he was in charge of [introducing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3426s) the computers to the school. So he was one of the very, very few Brethren in the UK who was really competent at information technology.

He was also working as a subcontractor for Hygiene Solutions. In fact, I introduced him to Hygiene Solutions because he had two or three businesses and one of them was electrical and automation for machinery. And he was actually working on the Deprox, on the [design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3456s) of it, on trying to redesign it to overcome these problems at the point when I left the Brethren. So the evidence is completely overwhelming that it was Hygiene Solutions who organized this massive hacking attack and of course they were the only people with a motive to do so because the social media and the website and everything was all about Hygiene Solutions. It didn't touch on anyone else, it didn't offend anyone else.

So after all this blew up and I managed to recover some of the accounts, I didn't manage to recover other ones. Fortunately, the [host](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3494s) had kept a copy of my website, so I managed to get that online. I then put out a series of posts saying, "Warwick Fentiman, Specialist Hygiene Solutions, has hacked my social media, has hacked my website, and this is illegal and this is criminal and they shouldn't be allowed to do this." I thought that was a pretty safe statement to make given the solid evidence that I had that this is what they had done.

Fast for a couple of years [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3524s) Hygiene Solutions or rather Warwick Fentiman, you know the Cambridge graduate microbiologist, sued me for libel and defamation for claiming that he was behind this hacking attack. So now this was a very clever move because the English legal system is horribly old-fashioned and complicated. He sued me in the high court.

It was a civil case in the high court. If it's a civil case, you don't get legal aid. You only get legal aid for criminal cases. If it's in the high court, you can't just be represented by a lawyer, you need a barrister as well, which is like an extra super turbocharged lawyer.

So basically, the financial [threshold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3573s) to being able to defend yourself in a high court case is tens of thousands of pounds. And I had no money at all. And by that time, I was in Canada anyway. So the only thing I could do, there was no possibility of me getting a lawyer, the only thing I could do was to put in a written defense. So I wrote a defense, I set out all the reasons that I believed it was true and I was kind of limited because there's no way for you to present video evidence in a written defense. If you got a special electronics expert, yes, you [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3617s) be able to present video evidence, but without a lawyer, that was impossible. So I was completely limited to just putting in writing the reasons I believed that, you know, these were the guys who had hacked my website.

I put in the written defense. They held a pre-trial hearing a month or two before the actual libel case in which for some technical reason that I still don't understand, they deleted 95% of my written defense and the pre-trial hearing is done with a different judge to the final trial. And so everything I presented, everything you've seen now was [deleted.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3664s) It was never seen by the judge in the final trial. They'd had it deleted for some technical reason in a pre-trial hearing. I think if you go on to the next slide, you can see that.

This is just a little section out of the court case which the Chicago Brethren are holding against me, which is the libel case. And this is the basis of their claim that the court has proved that I'm a liar. So [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3694s) says, this is the judge. 

"As set out above, Mr. Fentiman relies on three further statements as being defamatory of him. Each of them relates to a cyber attack on Mr. Marsh's various internet platforms, which Mr. Marsh alleges had previously taken place. Mr. Fentiman does not know whether any such attack did in fact take place. Accordingly, he is in no position to deny that it did. Even if it did, however, [Mr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3724s) Fentiman's case is that he, and for that matter, as far as he knows, Specialist Hygiene Solutions, had nothing whatever to do with it. Mr. Marsh's defences of truth, and to the effect that there was a public interest in publishing allegations to the contrary effect have gone due to the order of Judge Parks QC."

So when they say the defense is of truth, if you're accused of libel, your primary defense is to say it's not [libel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3755s) because it's true. So of course, my primary written defense was to say, the allegations I made are true, and here's all the evidence, here's all the logins, here's the video. I mean, I did the video back then to present in my defense, and then found there was no way of presenting a video in defence. But as it says here, this judge never saw any of that evidence because it had already been deleted in a previous pre-trial hearing by Judge [Parks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3785s) QC.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3786s)

Wow.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3787s)

When this actual trial took place, I was in Canada, I was not represented, 90% of my defence had been wiped out, and of course, they found me guilty of libel and defamation because I couldn't defend myself. They had deleted my entire defense. Now, note, of course, Mr. Fentiman says he had nothing to do with it and knew nothing about it. But note also that this is the guy who claims to be a Cambridge graduate microbiologist. You can judge for yourself whether I lied when I said that Hygiene Solutions and Warwick Fentiman hacked my websites and my social media. And you can judge for yourself whether Warwick Fentiman is telling the truth when he says he didn't know it had happened and he knew nothing about it and it wasn't him and it wasn't his company. So, you know, I'll leave it for you to judge who's the liar in this libel case.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3847s)

The conviction for defamation was because Richard accused Fentiman of hacking his website and social media. Richard could not possibly afford a lawyer and was in Canada at the time of the trial, so submitted a written defense. Most of this defense, including the extensive and compelling evidence that Fentiman was behind the hacking, was struck off in a pretrial hearing on a technicality, so the judge never even considered it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3870s)

So, this is two days prior to the libel case, literally two days before this court hearing was heard. And finally, after four years of investigation, the half of the Deprox fraud had actually hit the fan. And that is the half where the operators were lung damaged by breathing in the fumes when they re-entered the room after a process had taken place. And I was talking to this journalist, Camilla Turner, of the Daily Telegraph, in all the lead up to the trial. And then I went to Canada. And she, you know, I was kind of hoping she would publish it a bit sooner. This was far too late to have any effect on the trial.

But so I'll read it. It's the Daily Telegraph, which is Britain's number two newspaper. 

"NHS staff are at risk of inhaling toxic fumes from cleaning machines, investigation finds. NHS staff are at risk of inhaling toxic fumes from cleaning machines, a Telegraph investigation has found. Employees claim that hospitals have been gassing them after they suffered nosebleeds, burning eyes and chest [infections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3945s) following exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapour. NHS trusts across the country could now face legal action from staff who operated Deprox machines without adequate training or protective gear.”

 So next slide. From further down the same article, 

"Two domestic managers took made claims against their NHS trust and won five-figure payouts between them in settlements earlier this year. But thousands more hospital workers could be at risk as the machines are being used at over 100 hospitals across England and Wales, according to information obtained through Freedom of Information requests. One domestic supervisor who reached a settlement with their employer last [month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=3992s) described using the machines as horrendous, adding, 'What we were breathing in, we only know now how dangerous it was. We were breathing in toxic fumes. They were gassing us. When you went into the room, your eyes burn, your throat burns, you cough. You knew in your mind that this can't be right, but you were always reassured that it is safe.'"

So remember this, this has hit the fan, but this is only half the Deprox fraud. This is the part that led up to 2015\. This is why they turned the disinfection level down. Now the second half of the fraud, where the machines are all turned down to this very low level and are not disinfecting, is still carrying on. No one has ever actually taken these guys to court over it. And there's a reason for that, and that is that there's no actual government body responsible for regulating this type of equipment.

When I made my report, I spoke to the Health and Safety Executive, and they said, "Yes, we're interested in the fact that the operators are breathing the fumes. That comes under our jurisdiction. We can't comment [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4065s) look into the disinfection level because that's not health and safety. That's medical equipment. You need to go to the medical equipment, medical device regulators." So I went to the Medical Equipment Medical Device Regulatory Authority in the UK and they said, "No, we only deal with medical devices that actually come in contact with the human body, you know, like thermometers or tubes or things that actually go [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4095s) the human body. This is janitorial equipment. This is outside our jurisdiction. You need to talk to the Health and Safety Executive."

So the fact is, because it was a new technology that hadn't really been done before, there was absolutely no regulatory body. No, it just fell between two stools. And as a result of that, which situation still continues, Hygiene Solutions, now renamed Inivos, still get away with these completely false claims of million-fold reduction in germs. And they still carry on the same practice of when they're doing a demonstration for a hospital or when they know the hospital is doing testing. Warwick Fentiman personally takes his own customized machine and he does the clean himself using extra concentrated hydrogen [peroxide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4149s) and set to a very high level. It gives a very good result. Then he goes away, the hospital signs the contract, and then the machines they get are all turned down to an eighth to a tenth of the level that the demonstration machine is set at.

And so I continue to publish about this, I continue to talk about it at every opportunity I get, and that's what leads us on to the next case, which is the contempt of court case. So this is another headline that came up at the same time.

 "Thousands of NHS staff in the UK could have been put at risk of inhaling toxic fumes. Several employees have already reported suffering from nosebleeds, sore throats, burning eyes and chest infections following exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapour." 

Now, the way this played out was very sad because the way Hygiene Solutions' contract with the NHS was worded, the NHS [ended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4206s) up carrying the liability. So the NHS paid tens of thousands of pounds of compensation to these scores of workers who had been injured. And that was coming out of public funds. That was coming out of your pocket and mine, and Hygiene Solutions got away scot-free because the contract specifically exempted them from responsibility for the injury that was caused.

 Now, you can only do that if you have horrendously expensive lawyers and [distribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4236s) money in the right places. But as of this date, they have actually got away. And the NHS, who they ripped off in the first place, also ends up compensating the people who were injured by their machine.

Okay, so this brings me to the final court case, which is contempt of court, which what happened was when I left Hygiene Solutions, they got me to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which says, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4267s) know, typical non-disclosure agreement, you can't talk about the company or their products, you can't talk about, you know, commercially sensitive information. What they'd done, which I didn't understand at the time is they'd secured the non-disclosure agreement with a high court order and it's a very obscure and weird legal anomaly that only exists in English law and it's called a Tomlin order.

And a Tomlin order means that you make an agreement with someone like a [non-disclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4297s) agreement, but it's actually you're making the agreement with the court so that if you break that agreement, you're in contempt of court. You're not just in contempt of the business you made the agreement of, you're in contempt of court. So having made this agreement and then having breached it multiple times by speaking out about this, because my understanding was, and my understanding still is, that you can't have a non-disclosure [agreement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4327s) that prevents you from whistleblowing on something that's endangering people's lives and health. You can't have a non-disclosure agreement that conceals criminal activity.

So I've not stopped, and I'm not going to stop talking about this, but Hygiene Solutions took me to court for contempt of court, for breaching the non-disclosure agreement, and thereby breaching an agreement that was actually made to the court itself. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4358s) the first time they took me to court for this, I got an eight-month suspended sentence, which is kind of slap on the wrist because you don't actually go to prison. It's just do it again and we will put you in. And then more recently, as recently as a couple of months ago, because I continued to breach the non-disclosure agreement, they took it to court again. They said, "Look, this deterrent isn't working. It's not working just having a suspended sentence. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4389s) want a proper prison sentence."

So the judge gives me, as the Brethren point out, an 18-month prison sentence. Now, this all sounds terrible, but there's one detail which they've missed out, and that is this is an agreement and a non-disclosure agreement that's only valid in the UK under UK law and in the UK courts. And I don't live in the UK. I'm not a resident of the UK. It's perfectly legal for me to talk about [Hygiene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4419s) Solutions and Deprox and all these things in Canada. It's not legal for me to talk about them in the UK, but it is legal for me to talk about with Canada.

And I can prove that to you with this document here. So this is 2017, so this is a few years ago. I was in Regina, I was publishing my website. This was actually a few weeks, I think, before they did the hack, but before they actually hacked the website and took it down, they tried to register [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4450s) UK non-disclosure agreement in Canada because they knew the only way they could actually, you know, stop me from legally, stop me from publishing was by registering the non-disclosure agreement in the Canadian court in the province I was living. So this is a little complicated, but I'll read it out. It's become a test case, so it's referred to a few times.  
“ Specialist Hygiene Solutions Limited v. Marsh.”

( And the judge was the Honourable Judge Barrington Foote. [Barrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4480s) again.)

“Judgements and orders, foreign judgments, registration.”

(Now, there's a provision between Commonwealth countries, you know, most first world countries, that if you get an order that's made in a court in one country, under certain circumstances, you can register it in another country. So, for example, if I owed money to someone in England and they got a court order saying, you have to pay me $1,000, and if I had subsequently moved to a different [country,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4512s) they could register that order in a different country and collect the money from me in a different country. Now that only works with money judgments for debts to be collected. So the Hygiene Solutions, they got a very top lawyer and they got all their legal experts and they went to enormous expense and took a case against me in the Regina courthouse in the middle of Saskatchewan. This is the summary of the case from the legal documents.)

"The parties entered into agreement to settle a dispute which included a provision that an order be filed with the High Court of [Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4553s) of England and Wales. The order was in the form of a Tomlin order, which stays all further proceedings on agreed terms. The agreed terms are not part of a Tomlin order, so they cannot be directly enforced as an order of court. The judgment applied pursuant to the Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act to register a portion of the order wherein the court ordered the respondent to comply with his undertaking held, the application was dismissed. The Act can be used to enforce [undertakings,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4583s) however at issue was whether the order included an undertaking. Evidence from the British counsel to the applicant could not be qualified as expert evidence. Thus there was no evidence of English law. And the court must assume that English law is the same as Saskatchewan law. In accordance with section 4.4 of the Act, the high court ordered a stay. The court could not conclude based on the form of the high court order and Saskatchewan law that the high court had ordered an undertaking."

Now this is why you need a [lawyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4614s) when you go to court because to most of you, this sounds like it might as well be in Latin for the sense you can make of it. But basically what it's saying is you can't register that court order in Canada. There's no way you can do it. Case dismissed. Okay, so this is another reference on a lawyer's website to this particular case, which, as I said, has become a test case. It's kind of referred to as a precedent for when this kind of thing happens.

"The Tomlin order it issued was obtained on consent and was subject to agreed terms that were referenced in the preamble to the Tomlin order, but which were not specifically part of the order made by the UK court." 

(Now keep in mind here that Tomlin order doesn't exist in Canada. It's a peculiarity of English law. You can't do this in Canada.)

 "SHS Specialist Hygiene Solutions claimed that the respondent was in breach of the agreed terms and it sought to enforce the agreed terms in Saskatchewan, Canada without first obtaining such an order from the UK court. The Canadian court dismissed the application on the basis that there was no UK order was in existence with respect to the agreed terms. Accordingly the application was deemed premature and it was therefore dismissed."

So in plain [English,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4693s) the non-disclosure agreement is applicable only in the UK. If they wanted to make it work in Canada, they'd have to register in Canada. They've tried, they can't do it, the court has dismissed it. And if it was applied outside the UK, if the UK order would be sufficient to prevent me from speaking in Canada, then they wouldn't, obviously, they wouldn't have gone to the trouble to try [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4724s) register this in Saskatchewan. The very fact that they've tried to register this in Canada proves that as it currently exists, it only applies in the United Kingdom. So it's perfectly legal, just as it's perfectly legal for me to smoke pot in Canada, not that I do, but it's legal for me to do so, but not legal for me to do so in the UK, I can speak perfectly freely. I can say what I like about Hygiene Solutions and Deprox as long as I'm here in Canada.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4753s)

And I think it's a subject that very much needs to be exposed.And I hope your children see this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4757s)

Absolutely. 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4760s)

Well, exactly. So, yes, they, you know, going back to the Barrington website, the truth about area N, they say, "Yes, he has been convicted in a UK court and he has an 18-month prison sentence." Yes, but it's a paper tiger because I'm not in the UK. And the judge, when he made that sentence, wasn't even told where I was. He just assumed that I was in the UK. I'm a UK citizen. But the fact is, at the point I was speaking out, I mean, and they cite three cases of me speaking [out,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4793s) there's an interview with James DiFiore, there's the Canadaland podcast, and I think there was one other podcast I did. Yeah, the Sean Atwood podcast. These are the cases they're taking against me, but I was in Canada for all of those. I've been in Canada for five years now. So that, you know, that whole claim about, you know, fugitive from justice is...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4818s)

...living in his truck.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4820s)

Living in this... completely untrue. I mean, I just started a new job for which I needed a criminal record check. And of course, I applied for a criminal record check in Canada and passed with flying colors. I'm a free citizen here. I don't have a criminal record. I can say what I like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4837s)

What a thing to even be sitting there and throwing that at you when you hear the whole story about what it is that you were whistleblowing on. Yeah, any human in this case should have been whistleblowing on this. Anybody should have been doing that. I had two preemie babies. Absolutely 100%. We had cases with C. difficile like this. But again, here's the Brethren with that sense of entitlement. They don't give a shit about other humans. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4867s) guarantee you if those were Brethren inside there, that was part of their family, they wouldn't have been doing what they were doing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4873s)

Well exactly, and the point is that the Brethren have their own health insurance, so they're not using NHS hospitals, they're not using public hospitals. This is just worldly people it's affecting, it doesn't bother them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4885s)

The conviction for contempt of court is because Richard repeatedly breached a UK court secured non-disclosure agreement, a gag order which forbids him to speak about the Deprox scandal. However, the NDA only applies within UK jurisdiction. There is no restriction on what Richard says in Canada. The July 2023 conviction related to Richard speaking on the Blackballed, Canadaland, and Atwood True Crime podcasts. Richard was in Canada for all these podcasts.

In 2017, Fentiman attempted to register the NDA in Canada. The application was denied and Fentiman ordered to pay costs. This is further proof that the UK court order does not apply in Canadian jurisdiction. Richard obtained a clean criminal record check this month when he started a new job. He is not a fugitive and is not wanted by the police.

Richard's Facebook account in his own name was permanently closed due to continual complaints from PBCC lawyers. Despite multiple attempts, Richard is unable to get a Facebook account using his real name and ID. He therefore must rely on others to post content on his behalf. Muhamaed Sohail published his content with Richard and other ex-Brethren who were in a similar situation.

Richard appears in person on the Get A Life podcast and does not hide behind a pseudonym. So I want to let everybody know that in the description, we'll have all the links to all the articles. This is such an important message that I think we need to replay that video again and we'll end this podcast with listening to that video one more time, looking at those babies, looking at what this company has done. It is not [right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=4987s) And anybody who supports the PBCC, this is why I am such an advocate on knowing who you're dealing with. Research who you are dealing with and make sure that you have the background to make the decision you need to make because we're dealing with people's lives.

So thank you so much, Richard. Thank you so much for pouring your heart and soul out in that and letting everybody understand. I know we were getting a lot of emails wondering about it. So this gives a very good explanation. We also will be eventually doing a really in-depth series of podcasts about this. That's to come later on. So stay tuned for that. And thank you, Lynette, for all your work with the Chicago stuff. That was, I know that that was a lot of driving back and forth with you, but we had a win even though they went down fighting. They really showed their true colors in understanding how the PBCC work. Yeah, so thank you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=5048s)

Everyone, we couldn't have, we couldn't have rebutted their lies if we hadn't had your video evidence of what was actually said at the meeting. So thank you very much for that.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=5057s)

Yeah, thank you. Thankyou for all the work you guys do. Appreciate it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=5060s)

Thank you so much everyone for watching. Until next time, much love to you all.

### **None News Australia**

“New technology is set to revolutionize the way hospitals deal with the growing problem of superbugs. An Australian hospital is leading the way in protecting the most vulnerable patients, including newborn babies.

Riley Maloney is a little survivor, so too his twin brother Axel. Both were born three months early after their mum Leslie went into premature labour. Just seeing them, they were just so tiny and so fragile and that in itself is just so traumatic. Westmead's neonatal intensive care unit has been their home for 49 days. Little lives here not only hang in the balance, their fragile immune systems make them more vulnerable to germs that are resistant [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZshlrGq7vs&t=5109s) antibiotics.

If you look at our intensive care unit, there are surfaces everywhere that are almost impossible to clean.

This is the latest weapon in infection control. This automated machine emits vapors of hydrogen peroxide into the air, blasting bacteria and decontaminating a room in a matter of hours.

We're now able to reduce environmental contamination far beyond what we could normally do.

This million-fold reduction in bacterial load lasts up to six months.

It's also very safe. The room is cleared while all vents and doors are sealed as the machine goes to work. About one in three babies which weigh less than one and a half kilos will get an infection in their bloodstream, which is why hygiene is so important. And because the machine is mobile, other parts of the hospital can also benefit. It's so important to just make sure that they're in the safest environment that they can be in. Gabriella Rogers, Nine News.”

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
