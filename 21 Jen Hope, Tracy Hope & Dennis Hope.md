## Summary

Where there is Hope, there is Life - and in this episode we have a lot of Hope happening. Join our 3 guests as we discuss 40 years of cultic abuse! Imagine the realization that a group that calls itself a church, so abusive and horrific that one must be partially drunk to sit through their meetings! Maple Creek, SK has been a PBCC group marked with hardline religious abuse, emotional abuse and has had constant huge losses of their young people. Could this be the key why? We hear Jen read a letter of her father's describing what he witnessed in his last 5 years of being in there, not ever being able to forget. Tracy recounts his parents being told that if he was dead- at least they would know where he is and Dennis informs us how Alan Drever had access to him. Our hearts break at the inaction of the past from the PBCC in Maple Creek and how they continue to turn a blind eye to the horrific abuse and generational trauma that happened. Together we bring Hope that this will change.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=10s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back. We have a gang here with us today. I think Richard said, "Where there is hope, there is life." And we have a lot of Hopes on here today. We're here with Carman and Richard. And our special guests, we have Jen Hope Anderson, which is my uncle Glenn's daughter. We have my uncle Dennis Hope and my cousin Tracy Hope. So the reason why we've brought everybody on today is to kind of go through some of the history from three very different perspectives from all of us who were trying to climb our way out of the bottom of the totem pole inside the PBCC.

And so I'm going to start with Dennis first. So Dennis, when did you leave? What year did you leave?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D9bFlGk247ec%26t%3D68s)

March '73.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D9bFlGk247ec%26t%3D70s)

And what kind of what prompted you to leave? Obviously, it wasn't something that you just woke up...

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=72s)

I can't remember, but I think as soon as I got into my teens, I always said to myself, "I ain't sticking around in this ship." Yeah. And you know, I was going to leave whenever my chance came. And I remember it was the day that I left, I hadn't planned nothing or nothing, it just came right. I was walking down the street in Maple Creek and Russell drove by and he stopped me and he says, "I'm going to Calgary, do you want to come with me?" I said, "[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=102s), you bet."

So then what I did is I never had no money on me, but I had this account that my mom had set up for me in Bank of Montreal, had $60 in it. So I said to her, "Mom, I need you to come in with the vehicle, get this $60." She never questioned me why. She came along, I got my money, and that's all I had to my name was that $60. And then when everybody went to the meeting that night, Russell went home and I went [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=133s) and packed a suitcase and away we went.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=136s)

Wow.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=142s)

I was in Calgary for, oh, I don't know, this was in March, probably about a couple of months. Then I ended up, I got a hold of Glenn, and he had a '68 Chevelle, and he wasn't using it, so I told him I'd buy it from him. I used the vehicle up in Calgary, so that's fine. So I went, I come down the weekend to get it, drove it back, and a month later, [guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=172s) what I did with it? I totaled it.

But then not very long after that, I moved back to Maple Creek and stayed with Glenn for a while. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=186s)

So I think one of the biggest reasons why I wanted you to come on here is that we share a very similar story with Alan Drever. And we don't need to get into details of anything, but you have filed a police report, right?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=200s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=201s)

Yeah, you did file a police report. And I guess what I want the viewers and listeners to understand, so how did Alan have access to do what he did to you? What was the scenario?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=215s)

Well, I don't remember too much of what really happened, but all I know, you know, is Alan had this car from Maple Creek and he was going to be transferring it up somewhere up here in northern Alberta somewhere, I don't know where. But he was going to leave early on the next morning, so he talked me into coming to stay at his mom and dad's house with him, then we'd get up in the morning and leave. Well, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=246s) fine. So we went to go to bed, I figured I'd be sleeping by myself, but no, I ended up sleeping with him and that's when he started.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=254s)

Yeah.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=259s)

And then that was the only time. Now I don't know whether he, and I just never caught on, whether he tried many other times to get a hold of me, but I don't know. But I never had nothing to do with him after that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=275s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm really hoping that he gets brought to justice.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=283s)

I always think, like compared to you, mine is just like a pin in an ocean. Yeah, but it's still super, but I just don't, I should have come forward a lot sooner, so maybe it could have stopped him doing other things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=298s)

No, you know what, he's so protected in there that I don't know if that's possible. Yeah, I just don't know.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=308s)

As far as for priestly visits, I had a couple of times. There was one time I had Wilfred Hope, he came over, he wanted to talk to me. It was after a three-day meeting and we had, some marijuana was flying around. This buddy of mine, a cousin of ours from Edmonton, we were down to Doug Bond, I don't know if you'd ever know Doug Bond or not. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=340s) apparently got shot, but anyway, he had marijuana with him.

And there's these two guys from Vancouver, I don't know what happened to them, but apparently they got tied into some liquor and one of them ended up having to go to the hospital, get his stomach pumped out, that's how bad he was. And anyway, he told Uncle Wilfred about the pot flying around. Uncle Wilfred took him three days before he got up to me.

And how they done that was, they were going to come over after supper before meeting and talk to me. Well, every time I did that, I buggered off out of the house and stuck down to the pool hall, but he wouldn't talk to me. Well, the third day, they were already there when I got home from work.

Anyway, he gave me a big lecture about this, and he said, "You know what, by right standing, we should be going to the cops." And I said, "I know you should be. Why don't you go?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=410s)

And so for our listeners, Wilfred Hope was Morris Hope's father. And so, I don't know how much you can tell from how much you remember from your generation, Dennis, but from my generation, Wilfred Hope had it out for our family. I remember Wilfred and grandpa having quarrels. I remember the huge controversy that was [between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=441s) the two of them. And Wilfred was actually, I believe he was taking the lead at the time or he was helping to take the lead.

Yeah, so the hierarchy on our family, I don't know if we were able to ever climb out of what we were under because we had it coming from all angles. Did you experience some of that hierarchy in your generation, like when you were there?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=466s)

Actually no, to be honest with you. They never really picked on us, but that's because I was friends with Russell.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=473s)

Oh, that's right. And so Russell is, yeah.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=476s)

That's what helped us. Yeah, probably maybe after Russell left and I left, then...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=482s)

Yeah, you were the bad influence.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=486s)

Yeah. Oh yep, definitely. I bet you I said that quite a few times. If something ever went wrong, it probably was for that Dennis fella, it would have been all...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=501s)

Are you still a bad influence?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=511s)

So you talked a bit about the alcohol and the alcoholism. I mean, we obviously know within our family, within the Hopes, alcoholism runs rampant, right?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=523s)

We're not going to deny that fact.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=525s)

Right. But in your opinion, do you think being in the brethren made that alcoholism worse?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=536s)

Oh, definitely. Yeah, oh yeah, big time. And then like after I quit drinking, if I, there's just no way. My mom, I know three times after, you know, I could get ready and come back. I said, "No, mom, I can't. I can't drink that wine." Yeah. Because our counselor, when we went to the center, my wife went as an Al-Anon, I went as AA. And our counselor [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=566s) me, or told us, he said that if the person quit drinking and when they, if they start back up, they start off where they left off. And there's no damn way I want to end up where I was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=580s)

Yeah, because the alcohol is so available within the brethren.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=584s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=585s)

Yeah, and I agree.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=587s)

You know, like I always, I know there's been, I've heard rumors there's been two people from the church that they send away.

But I always say to myself, when they did that and then they go back to church, well, they're just beating the cause here. They go to church and then you have a shot of wine.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=614s)

Defeats the purpose. It is. And I agree. I have to agree with you that I think it's very hard for alcoholics to stay dry inside the PBCC, 100%.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=622s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=623s)

Yeah, if you didn't drink out of the Sunday morning cup, you were the talk of the town and you know, they'd be coming over to talk to you about it.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=633s)

Well, that was half the time, that's one of the reasons why I went to church on Sunday morning.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=639s)

Yeah, there's a few times, more than once, partying all night and come back, crawl through the bedroom windows three or four hours before I had to go to the church.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=653s)

Then I always had, I always made sure that I went to the, we always have a special care-meeting once a month. And my dad used to give me a dollar for them. That dollar somehow didn't make it from my pocket to the basket.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=676s)

So, Tracy, I mean, let's just switch over. Can you let the viewers and listeners know when you left? In my opinion, Tracy was the very first person of our generation to bust the jail cell open.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=698s)

Oh yeah, we have Tracy, but I just said another, just try to interrupt, but I was still living at home and I think, I don't know, 16 or yeah, no, I was 18\. I was in the Jasper hotel apparently, and of course back then the guy that owned it, you'd say boo and he'd kick you out. Well, can you imagine a hundred-pound guy in the bar drunk? Well, that's what I was. He tried anyway, he told me to go and I wouldn't go. So he called the cops. Cops took me to the end. They had just built the new police station. They had just finished. They took me and he threw me in the drunk tank. And apparently I said to them, "[If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=746s) I can get out, I can go away." They said, "Yeah." So apparently I did crawl underneath. I crawled underneath the bars. People always talked about that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=762s)

I've never heard that story. That's hilarious. Oh, that's funny. But so, Tracy, in my opinion, they were trying to make a statement out of you leaving. I mean, I know you never saw a lot of what we saw of you from the inside looking out. I mean, you were just literally scorned from ear to ear every single time that you either were coming in or going out. What was that like for you, being bounced around [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=800s) the beginning like that?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=801s)

Well, the one thing, especially looking back now, my parents protected me from so much stuff. It was unreal, the amount of flack they took for stuff for me that I didn't even know that they did is absolutely unreal. Like I cannot, Dad and Mom, man, I owe them so much for that. But the priestly visits, I mean, they started happening when I started going out [partying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=831s) with some people from Maple Creek. And Dad would never tell that I was gone, he covered up for me as best he could. But somebody invariably, I mean, it's Maple Creek, that's 2,500 people. Anybody from the church leaves, you know, that's kind of like a topic of discussion for everybody.

And then they find out. But the priestly visits were like 99% of the time, the questions were like, "Okay, no, you're out partying with people and there's a [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=861s) of girls there. You had to have sex with at least one of them. Tell us details about having sex with the girls." And that was like, that was all they cared about. They sat there for, and I was like, "Um, no, I wasn't having sex with them. We're drinking lots and having fun, but if I did, I would never tell you details anyways." And we sat for hours waiting for me to give them details.

And it got worse, like especially when I got out of high school or even before that. I was like, there's no jobs in Maple Creek at the time. I had no idea what I would even do for work. I sure as [hell didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=903s) want to do construction because it just didn't do anything for me. So I tried at one point to buy out Rodney's half of the farm so I could at least have a farm to build something on to try to create a future, and the church blocked that from happening.

And then they finally, I finally convinced them that I wanted to go to school to SIAST in Regina for working on bikes and boats so I could start my small engine business up, which is something I've always wanted to do, is have my own business. So that one [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=933s) let me do that for the first year and a half. And I got through the small engine part so I could fix like lawnmowers and garden tractors and stuff. And I was just getting ready to start working on going through another section for learning how to repair quads and bikes and stuff. Then I got a phone call, can't remember the person's name now, and they said, "Yeah, no, you're done." So I had to basically quit what I was doing, tell the instructor that I had to [quit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=963s), I had no choice, and had to go back to Maple Creek.

And so that never went over well. But then I tried to get set up in Maple Creek and every time I try to do something, the answer is no. And they'd let me go like pick rocks for Dudley and do all these menial tasks, but every time I tried to do something, the answer is no, all the time. And so I just kind of got tired of trying. And I worked with Dad a little bit to make some extra money and went out partying on weekends and [eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=999s), well, I got shut up a couple of times, but I didn't really care because...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1002s)

Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1003s)

Ever since Phil Boyer died, the dynamics of the kids in the church completely changed and Sean was all of a sudden the superhero and everybody was demoted. And it was weird. But like Sean used to be my best friend, and then after about a month after his dad died, he wouldn't even talk to me because he apparently thought he was better or something. So I was like, "Well, if you're better, then just get out of my life."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1033s)

And you know what? There's a lot of things that happened after Phil passed away with Morris Hope getting involved in their life. I mean, I have firsthand experience with Morris being over there when he shouldn't have been over there and being in places that he shouldn't have been in over there, right? Like I think when Morris got involved in their life, Sean got very high on his ego and everything changed.

For me, [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1063s) me looking at it from the inside out to where you were, you just, there was just so much bullying that you went through, so much gaslighting that you went through. You were just their punching bag. And I know that they were making a statement out of you for the rest of our generation that was at the point rebelling, right? It was very much you were being made an example of, no questions asked, right? When did you finally get out?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1099s)

It was in '87 or '88, somewhere in there. I can't remember. I think I graduated in '87 and then, so it probably was in the fall of '87 when I, well, they basically told me that they'd withdrawn from me. But I know that going back to one point about trying to make a statement out of me, I know that it was when I got shut up for the first time, it was like a big deal and they were trying to scare all the other kids into [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1130s) know, following the straight and narrow or whatever they call it. And because they've never given me a chance to create a future, I had no reason to stay. So I guess I was always kind of looking to get out, I just wasn't sure when.

And I was so naive back at the time. Like when I did finally get kicked out, and it was on a Saturday morning when they were, I can't remember what they called the [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1160s) when they were handing out the money or at least pretending, yeah, the care-meeting. Apparently, it was after the care-meeting that they, or during the care-meeting, then they announced that they withdrew from me. And I was out partying that night and slept at somebody's place, I can't remember. And I was coming home and then somebody was driving by and stopped me and said, "Hey, did you know that you got withdrawn from?"

"What's that mean?" I didn't really know what that was. Like, so was that another step? Is that sort of like being shut up but different? But that's when I came home and my mom and dad had all my clothes on the doorstep and they said I couldn't come in the house anymore. So I basically picked all my clothes up, put them in the back seat of my car and that was pretty much it. I lived out of my car for a day or two.

And then it was actually Chuck came down, he hooked me up with Rex Ferguson to work out at his farm. And if those two hadn't talked and got me a job out there, I don't know where I would have wound up. So between the two of them, they really helped me out in ways I could never thank them enough for.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1244s)

And I mean, there’s three of you and you've got two brothers that are out. And obviously your middle brother got the worst of the priestly visits. I mean, he went through hell and back. We all know that.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1260s)

Oh yeah. At one point, she was told to tell me that if I was dead, then she'd at least know where I was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1267s)

Right. Like I just, I just want people to just listen to what Tracy just said right there, that if at least he was dead, they would know where he was.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1284s)

Yeah. When I, the good or bad thing is when I left and was out working at Rex Ferguson's for a while, for I think about a year and a half before I got a job in Medicine Hat, I basically didn't talk to my parents hardly at all. Like they weren't allowed to really talk to me because they would get in trouble. And so I just kind of, [okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1315s), if that's how this is going down, then I'm not going to talk to you either. And I don't think I really talked to my parents like straight up for probably four or five months. From talking, living with them to not talking to them at all because they didn't want to talk to me. And every time they talked to me, it was like, "Come back to the church, come back to the church." I was like, "What's there for me? There's nothing."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1335s)

Yeah, yeah. Wow. I just, my stomach always gets so tense in knots when I think of what your family went through because it's so similar. I mean, I have to say, like our family and your family were literally the two on the bottom of the totem pole in there and treated like absolute crap.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1358s)

So Tracy, talk a little bit about what it was like to go to meeting after you knew that they had found out you had done something that they didn't like. What was the atmosphere like?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1370s)

It was, well, everybody was kind of looking at you and they'd like talk to you, but then they were kind of like looking at other people to see if they should be talking to you. So I mean, kind of go back to what I was saying before, it was they didn't want, they were either trying to make a statement out of me, make me bow to their will. I didn't even know how to make them happy because everything I did was wrong and everything was no. And [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1400s) forced my parents to pretty much say the same thing too.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1403s)

Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1404s)

And I know it was just, it killed Dad and Mom both because they both wanted to have me as part of the family and they were absolutely, I mean, they were forced to because when I picked my stuff off the front step, both Mom and Dad were crying and they said, "We were told that we can't allow you back in the house or we'll be withdrawn from as well and probably never get back in the church."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1432s)

But yeah, they sit here and say to this last article that just went out, Richard, right, that it is the family's decision on whether or not they want to have contact with the kids. It's such bullshit. It's not true. It is so not true.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1452s)

Yeah. And from an outsider's perspective, the reason I asked you that question, Tracy, when I first got there in Maple Creek, it was like, I just looked it up, I think it was two months before you were withdrawn from. And to come into a meeting there was such a shock factor because we were newly married, not really thinking about what's going on around in town. And you would see these kids come in and these older gentlemen would sit down on the front row and they would literally [berate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1482s), they would yell at them, they would all but call them nasty scoundrels and the kids would just sit there and take it. And I don't know how they took it because it was the most un-Christian, most ghastly thing I'd ever sat through. I especially remember Darcy.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1504s)

Yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1505s)

And you as well, but it was Darcy that I remember. I mean, they just dressed that guy down and he would just sit there and he would take it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1512s)

He got such, yeah, man, he just got the short end of the stick there.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1519s)

Yeah, well, I mean, this is kind of a classic example of everything that went on with our family and Harry and Morris and, well, Dudley just kind of followed along from what I remember. But Darcy was going to court for one of his own parents and Dudley and, no, it was, I think it was, I can't remember if it was Dudley or Harry, one of the two said to him, "You know what you did, you know [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1549s) were drunk and driving, why don't you just admit it?" And I said, then I actually, I told him, I was like, "Well, he's got the right to prove maybe the cops screwed up. That's the whole point of this court, is to look at it from both angles and make sure that, you know, if he's guilty for it, then yeah. But if maybe he wasn't, then at least he's got an opportunity to say his point." And they totally didn't get it. Like, no, in their mind, that was the way it was and [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1580s) no way around that.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1581s)

And I don't remember if it was Darcy or if it was one of the other young guys that left. Harry and Morris thought it was their, I don't know, their right to appear at every court case like that. And after the court case, it was Harry followed behind this brother as he left the court and yelled at him all the way across the lawn and all the way into his car. And actually, public people came to Harry and told him it was uncalled [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1611s), un-Christian and not necessary.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1613s)

Yeah, well, I actually, if I remember correctly, I kind of yelled at Harry too and told him like, "Maybe just shut the f- up, we've got something to work out here." And he didn't expect that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1625s)

Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1626s)

Yeah, no, they went out of their way to make everybody miserable to make themselves feel better. That's what I remember anyways.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1634s)

Yeah, I agree.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1635s)

They were on such a power trip, the two of them or the three of them, I guess, that they just loved proving everyone wrong to make them look great. In fact, it got so bad in Maple Creek that if you were doing something wrong, which I did fairly regular, that there'd be a whole talk going on and whoever could rat out what I was doing wrong to Morris and Harry first kind of got bonus points. Yeah, and they would move up the hierarchy. And so the whole point, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1666s) I finally did leave, everybody was following everybody to find somebody to screw up so they could rat out their whatever hierarchy.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1676s)

Yeah. And then when they broke a family, suddenly managed to chase you out and they withdrew from you, then they would focus all the attention on your parents. And we would have meeting after meeting about families that have lost a child and how wonderful it was to be in a family that had never lost a child. And that was Harry raising himself up the ladder and demoting anyone who had had a child leave. It was horrific.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1703s)

Wow. Yeah, wow.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1710s)

Yeah, after I was out and there's other kids that left after me, Morris and Harry both become like a target for everything. Like they had all kinds of, let's just say that they had a lot of really bad luck for a couple of years.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1732s)

I recall.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1734s)

One car getting filled with water right to the top. Yeah, there was a lot of stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1743s)

What do you expect a bunch of teenagers who have been ripped apart from their families and have nobody? I mean, it's just horrendous what you have to go through. What do you expect them to do? Right? Okay, I'm gonna move over here to Jen just for a few minutes.

So, Jen is Glenn Hope's daughter, which is Dennis's brother, my other uncle, who passed away this summer. It was the summer, wasn't it? Right. And I asked her to come on just because we had Dennis on here and we had Tracy on here, we obviously were going to talk about the struggles that happened within our family. And somebody who has struggled his entire life was Uncle Glenn. This man, if anybody met him, had, I mean, he radiated joy and positivity and literally wanted to change the world. I mean, he just invoked that when you talk to him. He was a very, very strong advocate for AA.

But his trauma from the Brethren really came in waves. And his most recent wave was just prior to his death. I guess, Jen, like how hard was it to watch your dad's struggle growing up with this?

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1841s)

Hard, obviously. He, like I have to preface with, I don't have a lot of memories because I think there's just a lot of things that just very traumatic that obviously my brain is like, block all this shit. But he definitely struggled super hard. And so in the early days, like he quit drinking when I was 13\. And in the early days, we had a lot of sickness in our family. So [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1875s) younger brother had leukemia and he almost died. My mom has epilepsy and she was in and out of the hospital often.

And so oftentimes, you know, he was kind of like an only parent. But I believe that it was drilled into his head that all of these bad things that were happening to our family was a result of leaving and it's why these bad things were happening, because they left.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1908s)

Yeah, right.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1910s)

And then leading up also to Tracy's death, I almost feel like Tracy's death was a pivotal moment that is possible where maybe that's when he started drinking again.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1922s)

And so for viewers, Tracy is Jen's sister who passed away a few years, what year was it? But it's been what, six years now?

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1932s)

2009\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1933s)

Wow. That doesn't seem, wow, yeah.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1936s)

I know, it feels like yesterday. But yeah, like, and that was my main concern when she passed away. I was really worried that that was going to be a trigger for him because in our earlier days as a family with all the health issues and everything like that, that was drilled into his head that it was because of his choices that that's why all this bad was happening.

So, I mean, I don't know this for sure because my dad just never talked about this stuff. And so it wasn't until, it was probably 2018 where I had a suspicion that he was drinking again. And it was just, it was just a phone call that he made to me and it was very reminiscent of when I was a child. And just because when he, when he drank, he was, he was sad and he was angry. Those were the two emotions that he felt, just [sadness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=1992s) and anger.

And so I just invited them over for Easter supper. We had all our kids home. And so he'd called and I said, "Well, do you and Mom want to come for supper?" And he was kind of crying and I was super confused and his words were slurring. And so like immediately, it's where my head went was I thought like, he sounds drunk. And but the thing that really tipped it off for me, and I mean, he was, we know now that he was [drinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2022s) then, but he kept talking about Maple Creek and it wasn't making sense to me. Like, I don't know a lot about Maple Creek. I don't know a lot about what they went through because it was just nothing that we spoke of. You don't ask questions. You know, obviously, because it was too painful.

But after he called me and he was kind of just talking about Maple Creek and he was crying about it and whatever, so I had to get off the phone with him. It was a huge trigger for me. I figured [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2055s) for myself that him and his drinking was a very big trigger for me, even as an adult. And I called my sister, Rosanne, and I was like, "Hey, so Dad sounds drunk and I don't know if he is," because my dad sober and my dad drunk are very different people.

And so she called him and she kind of got the same sense. And so we sent Vance over, which is my other brother, to go check on him. And he was like, "Well, he was kind of acting not really weird, just he's like he had this weird laugh." But he was like, "There was no booze bottles, you know, nothing." So he's like, "I don't think he was drunk." And then one of his friends, when Dad went into AA, this guy Bruce was like, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2104s) I don't know if he was his sponsor or what, but so my sister contacted Bruce and said, "Hey, can you do us a favor? Can you just stop by the house and talk to Dad?" And so he was adamant afterwards that he's like, "No, that's not drunk Glenn. I know drunk Glenn and that's not drunk Glenn." And so, but it wasn't until 2020 that that's when we found out for sure. And then that's when we knew. And then that's when Dad knew that we knew. But yeah, it was definitely, the church for sure was the culprit for his alcoholism.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2139s)

Absolutely. And you know what, he had made a post on Facebook. This was on February 6th, 2019\. I actually screenshotted it because often, you know, it's kind of how Glenn would talk, right? It would give these little blurbs on Facebook and then they would go away. So anyhow, this was his post, was, "Are the Plymouth Brethren in Maple Creek what they say they are?" And I do think that he really struggled when the Maple Creek stuff doubled up for him. How hard was it for you guys to grow up without grandparents? Because you know, both your mom and your dad were from the brethren.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2182s)

Like, I never, like I told you earlier, like I never knew much about the negativity within the Plymouth Brethren until recently, really. I just thought we were kicked out because they got a fucking TV. And sorry, I'm an f-bomber, you guys.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2204s)

You don't have to apologize.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2208s)

So I was always so angry about that, that we didn't have fucking grandparents because we got a goddamn TV. Like to me, it didn't make sense. And so, yeah, like my mom's mom and dad, I never met them. I've only ever seen pictures of them. I've never talked to them on the phone that I can recall. But they were also out in Ontario, too. So but Grandma and Grandpa Hope, we did meet them on their fucking doorstep for them to reject us. You know, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2238s) it was always telling us to just tell your dad to get right and you can come back, you know.

So, yeah, growing up without grandparents, really, because I mean, aside from, you know, Uncle Dennis and Auntie Paulette and Lara and Jeff, and then meeting you later in life and Tracy and Darcy and Sheldon. Like we didn't have the dynamics of like cousins and extended family. And it was something as a kid that you know, you would have your friends that, you know, they would go hang out with their grandparents or they go spend the summer with their grandparents or they would go, you know, be close with their cousins and we just, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2276s) never got that. It was totally stripped from us and not because my parents, like I know now that my parents left to protect us and not for any other reason other than to protect us. But as a kid, you're just like, "What the fuck?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2292s)

Like this, it's very confusing.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2294s)

Yeah, like super confusing. And especially when you just don't truly understand because it's never ever been really talked about or explained or anything like that. Like I just thought it was the TV. I just thought that that's all that it was. And I'm like, "Dad needed football that fucking bad?" He did. He could have loved his football. Well, he did love his football, though. He did.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2316s)

He loved his football. All football. So, you came across a letter of his.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D9bFlGk247ec%26t%3D2325s)

Yes. And there's a couple parts you want to read. Yeah. So, this is dated April 24th, '91. And this is addressed to his dad. And so I'm not going to read all of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2336s)

There's a couple of really pivotal points in there.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2340s)

So the one part he said, before, it's chicken scratch, you guys. So just bear with me. "Before I left the brethren or even thought of it, I needed alcohol to be functional in the meetings. If I went to any of the brethren homes for a meal or whatever, the first thing I looked for was the whiskey, wine or beer that they were serving. It wasn't until I had a drink in my hand or that he was drinking that could I really enter into any conversation. Then it just came part of my everyday life."

Wow. And so it was, he said it was at the age of 17 when grandma bought him his first six-pack that was the trigger of it all. And that's when he figured that's the only way that he could get through the meetings. And then the other part [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2393s), see if I would have actually done my...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2400s)

It's okay. It's all good.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2404s)

Take your time. All right. He spoke of, "When I ran away from home those five times before I was married, I wasn't running from you and mom. I was running away from the meeting each time. Every time I came back and I said sorry, but I wasn't really sorry. I had experiences in the meeting for the following five years that I will never forget." I do not know what that means. What year did he leave? Uncle Dennis, I have no idea. Do you know, Dennis?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2444s)

What year? '73. I left in March, and I think it was just right around that same about maybe February was when he got kicked out.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2455s)

I think he was living right next door to my dad and mom. Yeah, he was. Do you remember, they used to walk next door and they were playing cards?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2469s)

Your guys were around the corner and Glenn was on right next to him to that house that he lived in. That was Dudley's house and Glenn was buying it from him. And then when Glenn got kicked out and everything, that's when Dudley kicked Glenn out of the house.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2489s)

And he moved out of there. And do you, like Jen, do you ever remember if any brethren had reached out to try and make amends with your dad and your mom?

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2502s)

I don't, I honestly don't think so. Like I said, the conversations were very far and few in between in our house when it came to the church. I do know that he spoke to your dad frequently. Well, not, I wouldn't say frequently, but they did.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2517s)

I remember even growing up.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2520s)

And then his mom and dad, of course. And I don't think they ever reached out to him to come home. I think it was just whenever he would call, they would be like, "You know, come back, you know, like come back to the church." But it's just nothing that they could ever do. And I honestly, I don't know. I don't think there was any major push to bring them back or anything like that. I think it was just literally their family back, you know, like just come in.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2559s)

You just cut out there for a few seconds. That's okay. I do remember, Glenn was often, he was somebody that I turned to when I was struggling. And you know, we could go a couple years without talking and if I kind of hit again one of those waves, every ex-member knows what one of those waves is like, it catches you out of nowhere. And he was the one that I'd reach out to, right? And we would sit and we would talk for 45 minutes to an hour and I would maybe not talk to him again for another couple years.

And I do remember him, I was after my grandpa had passed away, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2590s) so his dad, and I remember Glenn had said that grandpa had whispered to him one time when he went to, and I think Glenn, you can, or Dennis, you can attest to this, that grandpa had whispered to him that there was something wrong in the brethren, right? And that was one of the last conversations that Glenn had had with his dad. So I just think, I really think that your dad carried a lot on [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2620s) shoulders. And he was always, I mean, and he showed it through his AA, right? He really was someone who was an activist. He was always trying to make, when he was in that state, right, he was always trying to find a way to make things better for everybody.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2638s)

Absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2639s)

Absolutely. Yeah. I just, I just don't think that the brethren took enough accountability for what he went through and what your guys' family went through.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2655s)

Yeah, definitely not. I think that, you know, I think that there needs to be like, I don't know, some sort of system for families that do leave. I mean, there should be. And like, I mean, it's just my brain because I wasn't raised in this. So it doesn't make sense to me that you're just going to cut family off and that it's not even the acts of the parents. It's the parents being forced to cut ties with their own blood.

And, you know, [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2685s) me, like I said, I wasn't part of it, but, you know, I do know that Roseanne, the oldest, she has distinct memories of just one day her and her cousin Cynthia couldn't play together anymore. And it was like Cynthia's mom was treating Roseanne like she was a fucking stranger and Roseanne's like six or seven years old. Like I just, and she wasn't allowed, like every day after school she would go to Grandma and Grandpa's house or [Cynthia's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2715s) house or something and she just wasn't allowed to. Just one day she wasn't allowed to. And how do you explain that to a six-year-old?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2723s)

Yeah.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2724s)

No, like I can't even, I can't even imagine how traumatizing that is. You know, like I do know that she's got some feelings towards that. And, you know, it does bring up some harsh things for her. She did go to Grandpa's funeral with Mom and Dad. And she said she remembers, and I don't know if it was Cynthia's mom or who it was, but she's like, "You know, they come and talk to me and they're like interested in talking to me." And she's like, she just [wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2754s) to say, "Fuck you."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2755s)

Yeah, like...

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2756s)

"You turned your back on me when I was just a child and suddenly you're interested in me? You want to have a conversation with me?" And yeah. So you know, she's out of all of us, you know, she was the one that experienced, I guess the most, as much as she can remember for as young as she was. But you know, and she, you know, she would tell me about times where she would only talk about the men in suits. So I'm assuming that this is the priestly visits, guys that would [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2786s) up to the house. And you know, her, the kids, like I guess it would have been probably just Rosanna and Greg would have to and Mom would have to hide in a closet. You know, like, and I don't know if this is after they got the TV or like when the TV or before that they got the TV. That's crazy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2807s)

Yeah.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2810s)

So it's, you know, I have a different perspective of it because I was never in it. I'm just the aftermath of it, you know? And even though Mom and Dad left and I'm sure did it to protect us, obviously, and I'm very thankful for that now, I lost my train of thought.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2831s)

That's okay. There was something I want to add in here when you're talking about landing up on Grandpa and Grandma's doorstep and being rejected. So I actually asked Dennis's daughter, Lara, we were texting back and forth and I asked her, I said, "What was it like when you would try and visit Grandpa and Grandma?" And so this is what she replied back to me. She said, "The biggest thing were the supervised visits. We'd go to Maple Creek to see Nina Gail, which are relatives of theirs or whatever. And I remember my dad calling [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2862s) parents to see if he could bring Jeff and I for a visit. I do really remember him always seeming really nervous about calling his parents, which was weird to me as a kid. Then Grandma Hope would also seem nervous and say she had to call someone first and see if it was okay. Then I remember there'd be some random person hanging around watching us. It was really strange. I also remember a few times we weren't allowed inside, so we'd have to stand outside to visit. And Grandma Hope would always just spend the majority of the time telling us it wasn't too late for us, they'd [accept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2892s) us and we could be saved. As a kid who never went to church, that whole concept was weird to me too."

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2897s)

Yeah, yeah. Her and I were talking about that. We, because she said something about the living room and I'm like, "You got to see the living room? Like I didn't even see the living room ever." I don't even think we went in the door. We were literally on the step.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2916s)

You were supposed to do what I did one time.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2919s)

What?

I was drunk and I was gonna go see my mom and dad and I thought to myself, "Why should I knock? Like this is my mom and dad's house. I can come in whenever I want to." Like I'm in, open the door up and there's a closet just to the front door there's a front closet. I fell in head first in that thing.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2953s)

Yeah, no, it was just, I'm just thinking back to back when I was 10-ish, I guess. I must have got a lot of my Grandpa Hope's mechanical creativity and stuff. But I remember it was always funny because Harry was always supposedly the mechanic of the church and he knew everything. If you wanted something figured out, he was the one to go to all the time. And so I think I was 12 and my dad bought me a little dirt [bike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=2983s). I mean, I drove that thing everywhere. And then I wanted another one and I was talking to one of the kids at school in high school and he had a 400 cc bike, but he said it's in a box. Like literally the transmission is ripped apart, every piece of every bolt out of it. I said, "Okay, that's fine. I'll give 40 bucks for it."

So I brought this box of motorcycle stuff home because it literally filled the back of the truck with just stuff because it's totally taken apart. And I remember Harry telling everybody off, "[He'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3014s) never get that thing going, not a chance." About a month later, I drove up past his farm because I was supposed to be the dumb kid and he's supposed to be the smart one, and I was fixing stuff that he had no idea how it worked. So it was pretty cool.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3032s)

I love it.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3032s)

Kind of what Jen was saying, too, even my daughter's like, "Why can't we ever go visit your dad and mom?" I think I took them out there once when they were five because the church kept flip-flopping what they would do all the time. Over the last 20 years, they'd go through phases where they couldn't even talk to us or they'd get another priestly visit or be talked about in church again, to a point where they were, everybody that's left is trying to get everybody back.

And so I remember Mom inviting us over for a turkey supper. So me and Darcy and Sheldon went over there for a turkey supper and trying to make the family feel like a family again. And then that all, then they decided, no, they didn't want contact anybody that left. And so we kind of went through a [phase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3080s) of don't talk to anyone. And then they went to Winnipeg. I think my daughter was four or five at the time. And they said, you know, I actually, I asked them, I was like, "You know, I want you to meet my daughter." And so we flew out there and spent the afternoon with them. And I felt sorry for Dad because he just kept looking at, because Darcy and Sheldon were both there. And we actually got the last family photo we ever had was there. And he kept saying over and over again, "This is so wrong, this is so wrong."

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3117s)

Like you guys being there was wrong?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3119s)

It was so wrong that we weren't a family.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3122s)

Right.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3123s)

Yeah, and that bothered him to absolutely no end. And he's like holding my daughter and like, yeah, she didn't know who he was at first and then eventually kind of warmed up to him and like all kids tend to do. Yeah, it's hard.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3141s)

It's hard on them too. Like my, and I mean my daughter was the same thing. My boys didn't really want, they didn't really have an interest. It was like they had, there was like, "Yeah, you know what? You're not choosing us and screw you, you're out of our life." Where my daughter really yearned for that. She wanted to have, I did too. Yeah, she just really yearned for that. And I mean, she tried, but it's just, it's hard when you know, they're 13, 14, 15 years old and they're just trying to enter into the life and [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3171s) such an odd separation that is still inside that relationship. And that's what my daughter couldn't get over was, I mean, when she kind of got old enough, she was like, "Yeah, it's too stressful on me, Mom. Like I can't do this because it's not, it doesn't feel the way it should feel."

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3187s)

Yeah, for me, especially the last three or four years, other than both my brothers, it almost, I was kind of laughing at myself, I almost feel like I'm either one of my grandpas. It's like we went to a new country and starting all over again because everybody, all your family's gone essentially, other than the people left that you still can talk to.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3210s)

The cool ones.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3214s)

But like for immediate family, other than relatives and stuff, yeah, as far as my parents. And I mean, every Christmas is tough because everybody's going home with their parents and doing everything. And yeah, it's like I'm starting over again.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3229s)

It is hard.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3230s)

One thing, one thing I'll say about your parents, Tracy, they never forgot it. I saw your mom weep, you know, she, it just never got easier for her.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3241s)

I know before they took all their phones away, so now they have to use cell phones that can be tracked and everything they say. I mean, I used to talk, I talked to Dad and Mom a few different times and we had good conversations. It was like almost like catching up again. But now apparently they can't talk. Like I think my mom even said too, "We can't talk anymore because they're tracking all our phone calls."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3270s)

Yeah, but you know what? If you were to ask them in a news article, the news article is going to say that, yeah, it's every family's choice, which is so not true. No. There's one thing that I wanted to touch on here that is an absolute, I guess it's come up a lot on my lap since I came public with Alan. And I know Dennis can comment on this, is that there was this known fact that Alan's dad, Alan Sr., was supposedly having an affair with Grandma, so Dennis's mom.

And the more and more you dig around with it, the more and more I started getting these little tidbits of information on that, no, it really wasn't an affair, that it looked more like he was forcing himself on my grandma. And that he would bring her chocolates and he would bring her these, he'd bring her all these gifts. And you know, I know that they were both shut up for it. But I guess I just want the listeners and viewers to [understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3347s) whether I'm in other podcasts and I'm referring to Alan's dad, I mean, this is just one incident out of multiple incidents that have come my way of Alan Sr. The only reason I'm referring to it is because Dennis is here and he can attest to this too. But you heard about that, right, Dennis?

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3365s)

Yeah, this is like, I can't even remember how long ago, but like I just heard something about it, like from older people, that's something about my mom, our mom, and all this. And when that happened, now to look back, I'm sure it was, they were shut up for a couple of days.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3384s)

Yeah.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3384s)

I remember having to go to Uncle Dave and Auntie Joyce's for the couple of days and when that was happening, I, it was weird, why did I have to come stay here? And then as I got older and looking back at, oh, that's why they got shut up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3404s)

I mean, I can't disclose everything that's come onto my lap because that's not my place to do so. And the only reason why I'm bringing this up here is because we're all sitting here and that, you know, it's just multiple people that have said to me that they called it an affair, but what it looked like was not an affair.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3427s)

I don't know why, yeah, but all I know that they, yeah, they were sort of shut up for two days.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3436s)

Back to my one statement, I guess. Jen, when Cassandra and I started coming out to your farm, she really liked it because that was her, and she's always kind of amazed like, "Everybody here is a relative of yours?" And she's like, "Wow, this is so amazing."

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3459s)

We love our August longs. And I think that like the first time that our family, and I don't know, Cheryl, actually both you and Tracy were there at that first family reunion. It was in Elkwater, the first family reunion that I went to because the one before that, I was too much of a rebellious teenager and I didn't go with my parents. But the second one out at Elkwater, yeah, that was the first [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3490s). That was the time that we went into Elkwater to go to the pub to go sit down. I don't know, Tracy, you were, I think it was you, me, Roseanne, and maybe Chad and my sister Tracy, and we got kicked out because it was a private function, but they like let us in and we even sat down and everybody's staring at us.

But anyways, I'm like totally going off on a tangent there. But that was the first time that I was ever really around like a big group of people that was like [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3520s). And I thought it was so bizarre because I'd never experienced it. I was 16 at the time and I never experienced that before. Like it's just, it was the most bizarre thing. And so now, like almost every August long weekend, we just have, there's usually about, I don't know, there's got to be about 50 or 60 of us that get together, yeah, spend the weekend together and it's awesome. And I'm so glad Cassandra loves that.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3548s)

Yeah, it's sort of a high point because whenever I tell her that we're going out, we're coming out for the long weekend, she gets all excited.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3554s)

Yeah, probably so important. It's just family is so important, right? And it's not like we sit here and struggle every day out here. We have these waves, we have these waves that just encompass the grief of the loss that we went through. And I mean, I had many, many good talks with your dad, Jen, about that. And I know, I know his heart hurt. His heart hurt not having that. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3584s) I think he felt, I think he felt a little like an outcast amongst his siblings. I think he felt like he was the one that always got the short end of the stick.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3598s)

He spoke about it in a letter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3598s)

Yeah, yeah. And I do, I just think he really, any conversation that we had, he really missed his parents. He really missed his parents. And I think we don't sit here and struggle every single day. It's just these waves come up where you just grieve not having a mother and a father around or you grieve not having those relationships with your nieces and your nephews and your brothers and sisters that you grew up with. You know, like in saying that, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3628s) would you guys, what do you guys think? What would you say if you got to go and address the PBCC now? What would you say to them, Tracy?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3639s)

Uh...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3642s)

And I know, I feel the first thing, I know you've got so much anger still.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3648s)

Yeah, because when we first started, when Cheryl first started talking to me when I saw the podcast and stuff and I started to think, actually sitting down and thinking about the church, I never felt so much rage out of nowhere come up. And I was so mad, like literally wanting to punch the walls mad. And I had literally had to just like tell myself, "Take a step back, what's going on?" And then I started realizing, you know, where it was coming from and all the stuff that was going on. But [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3678s) never felt that much anger ever, I don't think. And it does traumatize you because like still to this day, every time I go into Maple, drive into Maple Creek, I literally start sweating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3693s)

Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3694s)

And when I leave that town, I hit the 121\. It's like I'm doing 140 and I don't care. Like I just can't get out of that place fast enough. Yeah. And this is still like last summer when we drove through there and I was like, "No, I just got to get the hell out of here. I don't want to stop. If I do, I'll probably get arrested for doing something."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3717s)

Yet they claim to have cleaned up their past.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3724s)

Well, you can't, you can't remove, can't change history.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3727s)

No, but do you think that there's things that they could be doing to change things?

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3732s)

No, they're worse. They're worse than when, from what I've seen and my perspective right now is when Mr. Symington was running the church, it still was, I would say 90% actually a church, 10% business because there's a lot of money floating around. As soon as Mr. Hales took it over and went to Australia, it was nothing but, it became nothing but a business. And today it's so much a business, there's not even a church left. Yeah, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3762s), no church left there. It's a business.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3764s)

Yeah, yeah, it's a business operating as a church.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3768s)

Yeah, because I found, I've just found out here now that all people actually have businesses within the church don't actually run the business. They get a salary and all the money goes to Mr. Hales. They're just pawns in the whole scheme of things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3787s)

I agree. Yeah. So I'm going to ask Jen, as a complete outsider, do you think it's important in what we're doing? Do you think that this is needed?

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3797s)

Oh yeah, I totally, I definitely think because if people don't speak up against, I don't even know what to call it. Like, it's so hard to call it a church because that isn't what it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3811s)

It's not. You can call it a cult. We're okay with that.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3814s)

Yeah, yeah, legit. You know, I just, I think awareness needs to be brought to it and I think that there needs to be pressure on them to become accountable at least for all the damage that they've done in all respects. So like, you know, if they want to make good of what they claim that they are, they need to acknowledge that [they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3844s) got some bad blood in there and they need to get rid of them. You know, they need to, I don't know, like they need to change practices.

Like, you know, if I'm not a religious person in any way, shape, or form and I've never even read a Bible in my life, you guys. But you know, I believe that like Cheryl has always said, like, you know, there are people who need church and there are people who need that. And I'm not judgmental against those [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3874s) do need it. But I think, you know, if you're going to be a Christian and you're going to be a godly person, to me, in my opinion, you are a kind, non-judgmental, loving, embracing human being. As soon as you bring business into it, it's just greed and you just want to protect what you have. So it doesn't matter if there's fucking pedophiles floating around, you want to protect them because you don't want to ruin your business.

And [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3904s) Dad died, it took everything I had to not go to Maple Creek and walk into that fucking church because I was so angry. I didn't know what I would say, but I wanted to say a lot of f-words, probably. Do you hold them accountable for your dad's death? Like my dad's alcoholism was definitely derived from that. That's definitely where it started [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3935s) it's where it ended because he had, as a sober dad for like 30 years, an amazing, amazing man. So there was something out there that triggered him to start drinking. And I don't know, Uncle Dennis, I don't know if he ever confided in you, but it just wasn't a conversation that he ever had with us.

So I just feel that, you know, he got deep into the throes of alcoholism again just because of the church. And because of, actually, I'm gonna kind of go back a little bit to that time that I suspected that he was drinking and his sponsor friend, whatever he was, went to the house and he kind of explained to us how when people get old, they get weird about death. And so I think that that's kind of where it led to, is just all the years wasted with not your [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=3986s) family dynamic of, you know, his parents and his, you know, and then, you know, the fact that he lost his parents without being able to really be part of their lives other than a few phone calls every few years. And so I definitely blame them. I have a lot of swears that want to come out of my mouth right now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4005s)

You can let them out.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4007s)

Yeah, no one's judging you here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4010s)

They are useful adjectives.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4011s)

Yeah, they are in my language anyways. And so I just, yeah, I definitely, I definitely blame them 100%. I don't, you know, anything that happened in Dad's later life, there's nothing aside from Tracy's death possibly, but aside from that, I 100% think it was, it's the church. I like, it's definitely that kind of started up again. And unfortunately, you know, he didn't have control with his drinking. Like when we found out he was drinking again, some would say to me, like, "He's an adult, what's the big deal?" No, there is, it is a big deal.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4056s)

Yeah, I know you'd be a lot like me when I was drinking. When your dad drank, like a lot of drinking like in the '70s and '80s, he would phone the odd like PBCC that he remembered from back in church and give them...

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4073s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that...

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4075s)

After he quit drinking, we stopped doing that.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4078s)

Yeah, yeah, because he was like, I mean, the years that he didn't drink, he was amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4085s)

Yeah.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4085s)

And it's not that he wasn't amazing when he was drinking, he was just...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4091s)

Really sitting in his pool of trauma.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4093s)

Yeah. And even in this letter, me and my damn brain, I keep losing my train of thought. That letter had a lot of stuff in it. It did, it had a lot of stuff in it. But while you're finding your spot... No, sorry, it's here. I need to get it out, otherwise it'll leave again. He talked about how, what he was like, because this is his letter that he wrote when he entered himself into treatment. And he talked about what his life was like leading up to that point and how ashamed he was as a human being and how he would have to sneak down the back alleys to go get his booze and how he was no longer a part of the community anymore.

Because for, I mean, this was in his, in [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4144s) the early years when they first moved to Gravelbourg, that he was part of the Kinsmen, he was part of the Chamber of Commerce. I think he was even the president of something or other. But then when he got into the deeper throes of alcoholism, he just became a recluse and he was just, he was just ashamed and he was embarrassed. And he was literally telling the story of what his life was like, and that's how he ended it. Like, it was almost [exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4174s) the way that he was at the end of his life.

He didn't, you know, for us to call them out to come for supper to the farm, there was always excuses. And the excuse was always, "Mom's not feeling well." Like, you know, and it was just because he didn't want to be social. He was too deep in the darkness that being social just wasn't something. And he was ashamed, you know, because there has to be a sense of shame when you're sober for so many years [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4205s) fall back into it and to have some sort of weak point or trigger point. I don't want to call it a weak point, but a trigger point that brought him back into it.

And, you know, but like I was angry that he started drinking again. And so the last few years, I didn't have a lot of contact with them. And not, I never said things to him that I would regret saying. There were, you know, I would just send him like the [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4235s) is the AA poem that is like the courage to explain, yeah. But you know, like I would send him stuff like that, but I would never, I would never tell him what I thought that he was doing was wrong or that he was like ruining our family or, you know, anything like that. Like I never said anything to him, but I think my distance probably spoke for itself.

And I'm not really proud of that, but it was just my way of [coping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4266s) with his alcoholism because it triggered me from my childhood. And I didn't realize how much trauma I got from that until the last three years. Like the day that I figured he was drinking was the day that I pulled away because I was so fucking mad. And I was like, he was, you know, he did so good as a sober person that how could he, in my mind, I was like, "How could he fuck up so bad and start drinking again? Why?" Like, it didn't make sense to me.

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4296s) I was like, as a child, I didn't have the option to leave the house or not be part of the family or not be around him when he was drinking. As an adult, I had that choice. So I took that choice and I separated myself from them. Not like on a permanent non-talking basis, I just, it just wasn't, there wasn't frequent visits. There wasn't, I was scared to just go to their house because I didn't know if he was going to be drinking. And like 70-year-old [drunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4327s) Glenn could be very different from 30, 40-year-old drunk Glenn, right? Like because obviously he doesn't, he probably doesn't have the energy to be even all that angry. I think it was more a lot of sadness than anger, grief. Yeah, yeah, yeah, as an elderly person. But I just couldn't, I just couldn't be part of it. And you know, unfortunately now it's not something I can take back that time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4353s)

But you did what you had to do though in order to be able to preserve your own sanity. This is the part, this gets me really riled up and I mean, I'm just gonna go on a little Cheryl rant here for a couple minutes, is I get so frustrated when I get questioned why I'm doing what I'm doing or why we are doing what we're doing. This has to stop. There has to be some sort of accountability. And I do, I hold the brethren accountable for Glenn's death. 110%, absolutely. There's just got to, like Bruce Hales and his posse has got to learn that if they don't want to come crumbling down, they have got to take a look in their rearview mirror.

Because people, you know, again, yeah, sorry, like, "Oh, well, you're dwelling on the past." No, we're not fucking dwelling on the past because the past is living here right here in the present. It isn't. The past is not the past. The past is still showing up in all these people that it's affected. And this is why I do what I do. This is why the accountability has to happen in some way, shape, or form. I don't know [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4424s) that is. That's why I put it out there to everybody all the time. I don't know how to fix this. But I do know, I reached out to Glenn this spring and he denied my contact. And I knew that whatever he was in, it hurt the shit out of me. Like it was, I hurt so bad that he was hurting so bad. And for the first time, we couldn't help each other. Yeah. And I know Glenn knew what was going on in Maple Creek.

It's just like this has to, at some point, our voices have to be heard in some way without the fucking judgment, without people saying that we're dwelling on the past. This isn't, this is somebody who passed away this year because of something that wasn't fixed or wasn't addressed how many years ago.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4495s)

I just, my heart breaks for your family, Jen. Not only, it's just you guys, you guys had no, there was no grandparents in the picture. You guys fought so much with your mom's epilepsy, with going through leukemia, like everything that you guys went through. And Glenn always had this way to stand up. And he did, he fought hard. This is not a man who did not fight. And that's what I want everybody and our viewers and listeners to know is this man [fought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4525s) hard. He fought so hard against his alcoholism. The thing that wasn't addressed was the wound of the PBCC.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4533s)

And that's the thing is that you know what triggered his alcoholism literally was never fixed. It was never ever fixed. So, you know, the fact that he went 30 years not drinking is a goddamn miracle to have that within you that's never been fixed. It's never been addressed. It's never been, you know, I don't know if there were any real amends made with his mom and dad prior to [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4564s) passing away. Like I think maybe a little bit, but it's still not to the point where there, anything was deep stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4570s)

It's the deep stuff. It's like sitting down, it's exactly why I would love to sit down. I'll sit down with Tim and Arden Bond of Maple Creek. I'll sit down with Bruce Hales. Let's get down and, I don't hate these people, it's about sitting down and let's get to the actual core of why we're doing what we're doing.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4584s)

Because you know, just to touch on like the trauma part of it. So when Dad quit drinking, just because he was a very, very, very, very different man, fast forward, you kind of like, you know, my childhood trauma from his alcoholism kind of disappeared on me. Like I didn't, it wasn't anything I ever really thought of. I didn't talk about like stories about things that happened ever. And it wasn't until he started drinking again that all these memories came [flooding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4625s) back. So I can only assume that that's what happened with him as well.

So that's what I'm dealing with right now currently, is all this trauma that has come up that I don't even know how to fucking deal with it. And now you know, when you're in the throes of addictions, that's what you dwell on, is the things that fucked you up or that you think fucked you up, you know, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4644s)

Yeah.

### [**Jen Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4645s)

So yeah, I just, and so the generational, even though I was never part of the, I didn't get the direct like you or Tracy or Uncle Dennis, like I didn't get the direct like, yeah, that you guys got from the church, but I got the crumbles that came from it with Mom and Dad, you know? And it, you know, growing up, it just kind of sucked because we didn't know, we [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4675s) know what happened. Nobody knew. It was, nobody talked of it. It was like some ominous, weird horror story that you just don't speak of. And I mean, it is now, like I get it. It is, it's exactly...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4686s)

I bet you look back now on Roseanne and Greg and be like, "Okay, I get what, I get, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally." Like it's, yeah, I don't know. It is, it is not, it's, that's what I said, it's a generational issue that they have, they've got to, there's got to be some way out of this mess. And so I don't sit here and we're not sitting here digging up all this stuff for nothing. It's good to talk about it, right? It's one of the [reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4716s) why I asked you to come on, because I knew you were struggling and I know how much healing this has given me. And I hope that that gives you another layer of healing of being able to just actually vocalize it and get it out there on what is actually sitting on your chest, right? But I do, I hope, I hope somewhere, some way, somehow we get somewhere with this.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4738s)

Yeah, Cheryl, I think that Jen made a, in Glenn's words, as I'm sitting here, I'm thinking about it, his words reflected back to almost 40 years ago that to go to a place that called itself a church, he had to drink himself half to drunk to walk in the place. And that never got any better. I mean, look at, look at Uncle Dennis, look at Tracy. I think for 40 years, something that calls itself a church [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4768s) so horrific that you have to drink to make yourself even sit there. To me, that's just such a shocking realization as I sit here, 40 years this has gone on.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4782s)

Yeah, kind of going to what Jen was saying about her dad and other people here that were in the church and left, I kind of look at us as survivors with scars that we don't want other people to see.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4794s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4796s)

And Glenn was hiding, Glenn was trying to hide as much as he could to protect his kids. I'm hiding everything I can to protect my daughter because I don't want her to even kind of know what I went through because, well, she's not old enough to understand. But I'm going out of my way to ensure she never has to deal with it because if the PBCC ever showed up at my door for some reason to want to talk to my daughter, let's just say it would not end well. It would not be a pretty scene.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4828s)

Yeah, I agree. I'm just trying to find an email. I had an email from an insider recently who actually talked about the drinking. I'm just trying to find it to quote it.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4843s)

I have something to say. Go ahead, Dennis.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4851s)

Yeah, go ahead, love.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4851s)

Glenn would always tell me, just before you tell anybody, but he says when he used to preach, when he was still in there and he used to preach, he said he would have a half bottle of vodka before he'd preach, right? Then he'd go to church and stand up. He said, "You'd be amazed how the congregation would follow you." What do you mean? "Well, I'd be swaying back and forth like this, the congregation would follow me."

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4881s)

Talking about the drinking though, I always remember the last three-day meetings I was ever at. It was almost humorous because the meetings would start off in the mornings like a normal preach thing where they're talking about scriptures they knew nothing about, making up stories to make them feel smart. And by the afternoon, the last meeting of the day, which is usually around four o'clock, it was all hell and fire and brimstone and screaming and yelling because guys are just hammered. Oh, they're totally hammered.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4915s)

So I found this email. So I'm not going to read it all, I'm just going to read a bit of it. So this is from somebody that's still inside. "I would say about 80 to 90% of brethren have literally no clue what is really going on inside. Thank goodness your podcasts are public and those on the inside are starting to spread the word. I personally think it's because of people becoming aware of what is really going inside the system and the podcasts are raising awareness. I want to see the [system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4945s) of control crumble so badly. Brethren drink alcohol to numb their consciousness. Otherwise, you think too much and it's too painful. Speaking from experience, I've pushed things away for many years that I don't agree with because it feels impossible otherwise."

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4963s)

That recaps it beautifully. Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4966s)

Yeah. It goes back to what I mentioned before, like everybody that's left, we're survivors and we're just trying to, we got wounds that'll never go away.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=4975s)

Yeah. But I do believe, I do believe that there is healing inside this, right? So, I mean, we all have done enough healing, otherwise we wouldn't be able to sit here and have this conversation. But there is this, I do believe that there's this healing that needs to happen on a much more grander scale that we're all searching for. And it is a partnership within the PBCC to create some sort of this healing, because it comes down to their separation rule, right? [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5005s) is this, I believe the separation rule is only in there to keep the money inside. I don't believe it has any other purpose other than to keep their secrets inside and keep the money inside. I do not believe it has a biblical reason as much as they want to say that. I know in my heart and in my gut and in my soul why Bruce Hales has that separation rule so ingrained right now.

So what I'm saying is that it's just, we all do our own personal healing. We all do. We've all done therapy. We've all tried some way to heal, to stand, right? We have learned how to stand again. That's what survivors do. But there is a grander scale healing that we are asking for. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5049s)

And I think one of the key things there, I mean, they can't change the past and they can't compensate for what's happened. But the least they could do is take responsibility, take some accountability for what's happened. Because at the moment, they're in flat denial about it. Every person that's left who's traumatized and all the things that have happened to them, they put the blame squarely back on the victims. And that's what makes it so hard.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5081s)

The psychological abuse that everybody goes through there, and even the people that are still in the church are still being, you know, you don't dare screw up or, you know, they're going to take everything because apparently now they can do that. But the psychological abuse to everybody that was in the church or still in it is going through on a daily basis is just unreal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5104s)

I think of my Uncle Glenn so many times when I want to throw this all away, you know what I mean? And I mean, Richard and Carman can attest to this, it's not easy sitting here and doing these podcasts. It's not. I mean, we might get on here and we can give an hour and a half of very undivided attention. But when you walk away, it hits us, right? It is not easy having, I mean, I can't even tell the horrific stories that land on our laps. [It's,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5134s) but it is, I think of Uncle Glenn many times when I do want to walk away from this and be like, "You know what, screw it all. Nobody's, you know, how are we ever going to do this?" He is somebody that I think about to get back up and realize, "No, I'm going to do this for him."

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5152s)

I always think too, the people that didn't make it, like Scott Hopkins.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5157s)

Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5158s)

Drank himself to death because they tore his family apart and wouldn't let him see his wife and kids. I can't remember if it was the part where if it got to the part of a divorce or what, but I know that for whatever reason, they kicked him out. I'm not sure why, but I know he died of alcohol.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5176s)

I was his nearest neighbor, so his children were actually staying in my house and he was just down the road drinking himself to death. And I actually went around his house, you know, after they'd taken his body away and I just, you know, you could see the, you know, you could see the trauma he had been through. But yes, it's true, they took his wife and his family away.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5201s)

They have it set up good, like that's what I mean. Like he knows what he's doing, that there's so much alcohol in there. I mean, there's so many people that suffer from alcoholism in there, right? And so then you leave, I mean, I was an alcoholic for years after I left. I mean, thank goodness I had the husband I had. He was literally the one who helped me break that cycle. I mean, it's hard. It is a hard one to break. But when you have that kind of psychological abuse, physical abuse, like every spiritual abuse, all these [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5231s) types of abuses that you go on there and then you've got this alcoholism running rampant through there, when you leave, what is, I mean, it is how we soothe ourselves until we stand back up again, right?

And I just think it's super important for people to find a way to dig deep down and together, us kind of sit together and find a way to bring another layer of healing. That's what I think everybody is asking for. And I think that's why there's so, there's been just a huge response [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5261s) us. I mean, out of thousands, probably how many thousands of emails we've got, we've only had one negative one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5270s)

Actually, talking about Scott Hopkins, an interesting point comes to mind. He had stopped drinking. I used to go to AA with him, actually. But he had stopped drinking completely. And then kind of as a reward for that, you know, the way the brethren think, they sent him and his wife on a trip to Australia, one of those three-day meetings with, I suppose, yeah, Bruce Hales. And of course, it was the worst possible thing they could do. By the time he got back, he was [completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5300s) back to where he started.

Because in Regina, the brethren, you know, there were a number of brethren with alcohol problems and the brethren were generally sympathetic. And so if you went to a dinner or a break or entertained and they were there, you would put all the alcohol out of sight. You wouldn't serve anyone alcohol, you know, out of sympathy with them, you wouldn't want to make it worse, wouldn't want to make it hard for them. But of course, in Australia, they drink, you know, far harder than they do here in Canada. And of course, he went over there and [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5331s) was the worst possible thing you could have done for the guy.

He never, he never pulled out of it after that. That was his last, you know, it just made me think about it, you're talking about your uncle, how he stayed sober for so long and then something triggered it off. Well, for Scott Hopkins, it was that Australia trip. 

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5352s)

And I always remember Scott. He was, he was the most amazing person on the guitar ever, ever heard. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5357s)

Yeah, he was. Yeah.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5359s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5360s)

Well, you know what, I think we're in it here and you know what, I ended in saying that I hold the PBCC accountable for these people that suffer from alcoholism and they never turned and looked in their rearview mirror at what they were really struggling from because I know, I know that they could have helped. Yeah, and we do hold them accountable. Well, you know what, I wish I had something lighter to end this on. We should have brought up one of Richard's memes or something. There's plenty of those that we could have brought up. I should have had one ready over my dad's costumes. Oh yeah, exactly. Uncle Glenn was known for his costumes. Absolutely, he was. They're hilarious.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5406s)

I always remember Glenn's humor. Like he always was making something funny somewhere.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5412s)

He was such an incredible, he was such a unique individual, right? Like he just, there were so many layers to him. Yeah, just incredible, an incredible, incredible man that was just plagued, right? Like it's just, yeah.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5427s)

After Glenn quit drinking, it was a while after where he said to me once, he says, "Yeah, Dennis, when you went to AA, started going to AA and quit drinking, I didn't believe it." He said, "I was waiting for that phone call, but I never ever did get it." He thought I would fall off the wagon right away. I can see why.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5454s)

You've done good, Dennis. You know, like you've really conquered a lot of that. It's, yeah. Yeah. Well, we are very grateful, Tracy, Dennis, and Jen, for joining us and giving us a little bit of an insight into your lives and what you experienced. And you know you're always welcome back.

### [**Dennis Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5477s)

Oh, I'll be here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5480s)

And hopefully, Tracy, we can maybe one day have your siblings join you. It would be...

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5485s)

Yeah, it would be because I know way more, but when I, I mean, I think looking back, it must have been headstrong and finally had my mindset on what I was doing and everything else I kind of went to the wayside and I just focused on what I had to do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5501s)

Yeah, you go into survival mode, right? And you just try and, when I left Medicine Hat, I left that all behind me, never touched it for, you know, 27 years, 28 years.

### [**Tracy Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5513s)

But you don't realize how much anger you have built up, you really don't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5516s)

Right. And it's all stuffed and that's the thing is it's still in there. It's not that, like this, that's what I'm saying is it's super important to bring it out and put it on the table. You don't have to do it all at once, just take a little bit at a time, right? Someone sent me a message the other day, it's like taking small bites out of an elephant. Can't remember who it was, somebody was, I think it was Peter Clarke, he sent me, he's like, "Cheryl, you just, all bites out of an elephant." And that's really what it is, right? It's, we don't have to do this all at once, but it is important. It is important. Yeah. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bFlGk247ec&t=5546s) anyhow, thank you guys very, very much for coming on and we shall see everybody next time. Much love to you guys.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
