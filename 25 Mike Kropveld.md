This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=10s)

Hello everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are back here with Richard and Carmen and our special guest is Mike from Infocult.org.

We brought Mike on today just for the fact that we had a mutual friend who introduced us and I was not aware of this website or charity at all. And I thought it was very good that we brought Mike on and let him explain what his charity is all about and its purpose and what we can do to help support it and how we can utilize it. Mike, how are you?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=51s)

I'm pretty good. I'm just taking the time to actually change my name so that people can see actually my last name, whether they might have an easier or hard time pronouncing it, just so they have a kind of, let's say, our organization tries to be as transparent as possible. So therefore, I'd like to present who I am officially to people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=72s)

Thank you for that. Yeah, if you want to just give our listeners and viewers a little rundown of what the purpose is of Infocult and your part within it.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=83s)

Uh so I start with the second question which is I'm the founder and executive director and Infocult's been around since 1980, uh and so we've been around for about close to 43 years. It's a center for the assistance and for the study of cultic phenomena, uh though principally I would say a lot of our work is around the area of assistance. The mission of the organization is education, to sensitize people to this area and to provide information and study the cultic phenomena in in its broadest [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=113s) of sense. And most of our work, as I say, tends to be frontline service, which is we tend to receive a lot of calls and inquiries, whether it be emails or phone calls, and via other social media, from people who are looking for help and information about this area.

And as we've been doing this for, like I said, about 43 years, we also house one, probably one of the largest libraries on this issue in Canada and also in the world. I say that because our collection is multilingual compared to other collections that exist. We work, as I am in Montreal, most of our work is done in French, but we have a large collection obviously in English because most of the material that has come out on this issue is in English, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=161s) we have also smaller collections in Spanish and other languages as well. 

We offer a number of services, some people might have heard about it, where we run support groups online. We're fortunate in terms of running our services that we have a number of professionals who volunteer their time to help run the support groups which we offer in English, for former members and in French. And we also right now have a support group for family and friends that runs at present [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=191s) in French but we are planning also to start one in English. That kind of, you know, and generally I'd probably say the questions and concerns we get go from A to Z on this area and about groups literally from A to Z as well. And not just groups, but also I think different phenomena. And basically any situation where people feel that they've either been impacted by an experience or someone close to them is going through or has gone through a radical change and they become worried and [concerned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=221s) and are looking for help.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=223s)

Are you familiar with the Exclusive Brethren and the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=228s)

Yeah, I can't say I'm an expert on the group but definitely I've heard about it and have had contact with former members going back a number of years. There are actually some former members here in the Montreal area as well and when we ran 2012, hosted the International Cultic Studies Association annual conference in Montreal in 2012, there were a number of Exclusive Brethren who came and I think wanted to kind of also organize amongst themselves get-togethers as well. So yes, [familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=260s) and have had dealings with former members of the organization.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=266s)

What in your opinion, what is it like, what are signs to look for that if you're in a cultic group? What would you tell people if they were to call you up and they're, you know, a question because questioning, you know, comes along, it's like, well is this a cultic group? Is this a group that maybe is not the best thing for me? What would your what would your answer be to have signs to look for?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=287s)

I'd say one of the primary signs, I guess I kind of use this uh kind of like expression, uh you can have a good experience in a so-called bad group and a bad experience in a so-called good group. So the question what you're looking for is, does this group respond to your needs, your interests, your concerns? How do you feel about it? And the difficulty with answering that question as well, is that you may have joined or getting involved in the group today. But what happens if the group changes over time? [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=317s) the ability to always retain a certain kind of sense of questioning and skepticism, I think is healthy, and is not necessarily negative to be able to ask questions and look at how the structures change. Because there is a reality that groups, I would say, like people do change over time they can change for the better or they can change for the worse. 

So the thing of being able to retain one's ability to question and say how do I feel about what's going on, because maybe many people who are listening to this [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=348s) gone through it, is like you kind of at a point sometimes in a group lose contact with yourself. You kind of doubt yourself and often I've heard from former members when they leave is they say they're going through kind of a difficult time, they're very uncertain but they couldn't exactly put their finger on it exactly what it was. It kind of the what happens is kind of that disconnect that goes on between yourself and that kind of your inner voice and what's happening. 

And so the ability to I think [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=378s) of listen to oneself and the ability to listen to oneself and not necessarily feel guilty or afraid because of the environment of group you're in uh to do that I think is important. But to get back, I don't know if there's an easy way to answer that rather than to be able to ask a lot of questions of the group and like I said, you might like, 10 people can ask the same questions of a group. Nine people can sit there and say this is fantastic, I love what I found. The 10th can [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=408s), that was like a great group, but not for me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=411s)

And so is it a cult or not becomes less the question than is the group going to be good for you and are you going to get something positive out of it? So would one thing, would one question be, um for someone who thinks there may be in a cultic group, what happens if I if I vocally, publicly ask questions? In other words, is the is the group dynamic open to persons questioning the group belief? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=443s) if you're afraid to ask a question, that would be a bad sign, I'm guessing?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=445s)

I I think if you're, obviously it depends on the level of involvement you are in the group as well because one of the things that I think and maybe different groups are function differently but in some groups you have different levels of involvement. I mean I know movements where people go once a year or just like tying once in a while versus those who have really kind of entered in into the kind of the center of the organization. So that varies. But those [questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=473s) I think are as you mentioned are really important. The ability to ask questions and then see how you're responded to. You know, are your questions respected? Are you answered? Are you viewed in a negative way for asking something that might be seen as controversial? I think those are signs of a problematic organization that's not willing to answer questions. 

Uh that I mean that's among other factors, you know depending what you're looking at. You know, it's like how much time are you spending in the group? Has the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=503s) that you're spending increased since you started? Has some of the beliefs or ideas, and this also depends on the questions you ask when you first got in, uh have those things changed over time? And why have they changed over time? How do you feel about it? 

So I guess a lot of the work I do is like encouraging people to raise questions and I think when you're in a movement where you're devoting a lot of your time, your energy and maybe resources as [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=534s), well why can't you ask questions? Why should you be viewed in a negative way about you know asking questions? And if the group is really an organization that is beneficial and going to be positive, I don't see why they shouldn't be able to or willing to answer your questions and respect the fact that you might have difficulties. I mean, in certain movements, which are a bit more traditional, it's easier sometimes to leave. The question then is, is it easy to leave the organization you're in? And if [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=564s) very difficult for various reasons, why is that the case?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=571s)

Yeah, that's a very good point. And I do, I think it's very important that, I mean, we're obviously going to refer to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. I think it's very important that the members that are in there have that capability and know that they have the ability to ask questions. Because I think that is a sure tell sign of how it's received of what really is happening inside there.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=599s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=599s)

Well, yeah.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=600s)

But at some time, I mean I guess I look at it because I just recently had, excuse me, a discussion about a new service for planning. Uh you have some people and I think that's the case with every organization that are what they call physically in but mentally out. And which relates to the question of exit costs. So people stay in groups like your your Exclusive Brethren, for example. You're married, you have kids. Well, you may think you're wanting to leave and you know you're not going to ask [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=631s) questions of authorities because of how that's going to be viewed. What do you do? You know, if you leave, what is the cost going to be to you? And I think clearly, I think it's important to note that the cost is not necessarily implied financial, but it's emotional, spiritual, social. What are those costs going to be? 

And so do you have people within the organization who are really, you know, one foot out the door but for various reasons are staying in the group? You know, and so [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=661s) are issues that come into play. So uh but though if you are somebody who wants to ask questions of authority and leadership, the question always is how do they respond? But at the same time is knowing sometimes how people feel or believe in groups, the thought of sometimes having a critical question is seen as being totally opposed against and almost evil or even thinking of it. And so that if you feel like that when you're in the group about having questions, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=691s) you're possibly not at a point where you're going to be expressing too much unfortunately. 

But that can change over time and I think based on your own experiences too, you can probably relate that at certain times, what you keep throwing behind you, the doubts, the questions that you keep throwing behind, get so heavy, that at one point, there's kind of that breaking point, which kind of was described in the past as snapping, where you just end up saying, "No, that's it, it's enough," and you're out. It can be [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=721s) very small and minor, but it's accumulation over time. And I think that happens with a lot of people in groups as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=731s)

Yeah, I think that's one of the biggest, I guess, questions that I was having. We have all these people that send us emails exactly that, one foot in and one foot out. And it is heart-wrenching listening to them sob on the phone and these heart-wrenching emails. It's just, it is hard. And it is true that there's just those one tiny last thing that when you snap and then you just decide to make that make that break for it. But [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=762s) think it is super important that we bring awareness to um Infocult for people, especially ex-members or members that are inside um in our group, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. How does a current member reach out to you um in secrecy? Like how can there, do you guys honor confidentiality and secrecy?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=783s)

Yeah, that's one of the questions we all get most asked at the beginning of a conversation, is it confidential? And yes, I mean part of it is somebody can call and uh they don't have to give us their name if they don't want to. I mean our goal is not to tell you or tell somebody what to do. It's not our role to say, you know, should you leave or should you stay? That's not our goal. Our goal is to help you make it possible, that kind of choice, cognizant of what the implications are as well as [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=813s) as possible. So you're prepared. Because I think sometimes there's an illusion that once you're out, everything's going to be fine and fantastic. 

Uh the reality, you may physically leave but that's another process now of having to deal with, okay, your whole experience, what was like, what was in, how do you integrate back out into the world at large? And there's a each case in each situation is different and says that's how we function. But people can write us or call us and it's [confidential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=844s) and don't have to give us much information if they want to chat. And actually it leads into an interesting project we were just talking about, about people who are physically in but mentally out. We're trying to organize a situation where people can talk anonymously to each other online. So to be able to talk with maybe somebody who's out with somebody who's still in, maybe have two people who are still in who are questioning talk to each other as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=874s)

Wow that is an incredible idea.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=875s)

So the idea is they are now, the question of working out the dynamics of how to do it and ensure not just confidentiality, but also to ensure that there's no risks involved for the organization ourself and for those participating in it. But it's it's tough. I mean I get those kind of calls too from people who are in and it's like they're married, they've got kids, what do they do? And I've also gotten over the years calls from when we say kids, you know, adolescents [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=906s) want to leave their families, they want to get out of the group they're in. And these are not easy questions to answer because you know it's not like you walk out and all of a sudden everything's going to be rosy. Yeah, there's certain practical things that you may not be aware of that is good to know beforehand in a sense, how do you prepare if possible? Now we're talking like kind of in an ideal situation. Uh most situations tend to be not ideal, you know, people leave, you know, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=936s) of different things and then are stuck. But that's why I think it's important to have the ability to be able to contact organizations and resources that exist that can understand what you've gone through and what people have gone through.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=947s)

Which is one need that I think is kind of poorly met at the moment, um for people wanting to leave, is that that while others who've left previously can offer kind of intelligent, [emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=967s) support and advice, there's often, particularly with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, they tie up their members in all manner of legal paperwork, particularly in relation to their businesses. And then often where there's a family breakup, they will hire the very most expensive divorce lawyers and try and retain, for example, the children of a marriage within the within the cult. Is there, do you offer or do you have any suggestions how people in that situation [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=997s) exploring how they can leave can get legal advice from a lawyer who may, you know, have some background or understanding of the issues?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1001s)

Yeah, we have a thing. It is one I guess of the lack that exists in terms of like an awareness. Uh our last president of our organization is a lawyer who's handled divorce custody cases and can help a bit with situations like that. There are other lawyers that [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1027s) have, let's say, contact with in different provinces as well, who have a knowledge of this kind of phenomena. Because it's kind of an understanding that there's a generalization that the group, if you leave a closed group and are perceived as evil, they will go out to protect what they see as the best interest of the children from the member who is still in. 

So you have to have somebody who understands that mindset implies that because you've left, you're evil, there must be something wrong with you, it's clear you have no justification to have rights to your kids. I mean we've dealt with situations with one woman, not in Plymouth Brethren, but a similar kind of [organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1067s) that they've put her into a psychiatric institute and she unfortunately got a hold of the lawyer that we deal with and to get her out because they basically claimed she was, you know, mentally ill. And from their perspective, they might say she was mentally ill because she left, but clinically she wasn't. And that was also an attempt to get uh control as a custody of her child, which fortunately didn't work. 

But these are situations that as a lawyer, as another professional, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1098s) have to have into consideration that you're not necessarily dealing with in quotation marks a normal family conflict. You got the normal family conflict with the group helping behind, you know, or in supporting. And which means unfortunately sometimes you're going to have witnesses that are going to testify against you claiming that you're a bad person, evil person, you're alcoholic, your drug addict. Actually just reminds me of another case where the mother claimed the father was, it was another [group,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1128s) closed group, that the father was an alcoholic and a pornographer. Turns out he drank a beer once in a while and he had, I think, Playboy magazine in his bathroom. 

But from their perspective, from the group's perspective, it was clear the man was an alcoholic because he was totally against what they believed in. So when you have that system, them is knowing the group, knowing where they're coming from, it can help you prepare for those kind of situations when they [arrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1158s). A lawyer once told me, you can have, you know, and I think it's it's kind of really pertinent, you know, you can have a good case, you can have a great case, it's not necessarily going to win. So it's cases like you're bringing up uh tend to be very complex and costly. And sometimes, you know, it's sad you win because you have more money. Not that you have, let's say, the truth on your side. And so that's something that I don't know an easy way out other than to have.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1189s)

I mean, one thing I'm thinking of is for people who are, I mean, again, talking about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, the process of leaving is likely to be an extended one. And there's opportunity to do things at a very early stage before the group's aware of your intention to leave that are going to make it a whole [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1213s) easier for you from the legal perspective when you finally make that move out. I mean, particularly in relation to business arrangements and financial arrangements, and also in terms of making sure that there isn't any ammunition they can use against you if it does come to a divorce or custody case. I mean, that's something where it'd be really nice to have a kind of a legal checklist. Have I ticked all the boxes in terms of having a really clean [legal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1243s) position when I finally, you know, when the group becomes aware of my intentions and starts to get their own legal team into place?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1247s)

Well, that's, I think you make a very valid point, which is you know, preparing ahead. If you're thinking of leaving or preparing, it helps not to say advertise too much. Yeah. And at the same time, you're under no obligation necessarily to say, "By the way, I'm thinking of leaving." Yeah. You know, especially if you're in the group and you know the [consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1273s) of expressing that kind of view. It's maybe taking the time to check out beforehand what are the potential downside to leaving. And so you kind of, like I said, how do you minimize the risks and problems that could arise? I mean, eliminate totally is hard to say, but how do you minimize it? And you don't want to get into confrontations or arguments either with people. 

And so, yeah, I don't know if this is so much to checklists because what happens with checklists is that people are in different situations often [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1308s) so they can check off this list and there are certain things that might not be on that list that applies directly to them. That's why, you know, the same thing when we're dealing with families or people calling, you want to get as much detail as possible because you know, every situation, though they may be similar, is different. And you know, your response to how you deal with it, the same thing is somebody thinking of leaving and going out uh can vary. You know, if you're not married and [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1338s) just single, obviously there's less hassles than if you're married with kids and tied in with the business.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1345s)

You know, so I think one thing that would be would be generally applicable is it's very helpful to keep really good records of your interactions with the group leadership so that you can produce that evidence in court if needed to say, "Look, I was coercively controlled. Look, they visited me on this day. It was these people, this is what they said." [Even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1368s) if it's just a diary, a properly dated diary, I think that is always helpful at a later date.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1372s)

Generally, it's always helpful if you're in and even when you're out, if you know when you're leaving, to keep a kind of journal because many people who've gone through the group experience when they leave, you know, what day was that? What month? What year? Because sometimes they all kind of roll into one another, you know. And so that's, it's always a good idea. It's the same way when you [leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1398s) uh often it's a good idea to keep a journal as well because you know once you leave, you may be a month or two down the road looking and say, "Gee, things are still tough. There's no change, I'm just feeling as bad as I did." But when you step back and you read maybe what you wrote, you'll find that there has been incremental changes. 

It's just that this kind of magical thinking when you're in the group sometimes stays when you're out of it, where it's like, "Everything's going to be good from one day to the next." I mean, just the reality is not the case. But [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1428s) is change that occurs, it just tends to be slower, you know, over time. So the journal is good to keep in as well as out as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1432s)

And electronic records. I mean, I had the experience leaving the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. I still had the computer they had supplied because all their members have to get computers from the group, which have got their own software on, which is kind of, it's like parental control software, but it also gives them access to your computer. And I hadn't even [considered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1458s) that part of it. And I, a few, well, three or four months after I left and I started publishing a few critical things online, I found that they'd got onto my computer and then deleted a whole section of my emails. So it's always good to have a, you know, if you're keeping records, make sure you have a backup or keep it on a hard drive that you keep in your pocket, because they can be very active in trying to destroy records.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1481s)

True. I mean, that can be the case. The thing is, also, I think you don't want to have necessary people always living in a kind of state of paranoia and fear. I mean, there's a difference between being paranoid and living always looking over your shoulder and just taking kind of reasonable [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1508s) of like steps to ensure that if you're thinking of going, that you're not making it more difficult on yourself down the road.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1514s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean generally what happens for leavers or people considering leaving from the Plymouth Brethren Church is they they get their own phones rather than having a church-issued phone which is monitored. They get their own phone and that gives them some independence of communication. That's one of the first steps.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1531s)

Yeah but it's, I guess, like a saying every situation can be different, you know, because, yeah, depending, because it also depends on your role within the church too or within any group. You know, are you on the bottom rung of the ladder or are you really high up and privy to information and you know and knowing, you know, stuff that's going on within the group that may be perceived as problematic down the road. So how you leave and the impact that will have on the group and how much they may react or not will also depend on that. [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1568s) some people, I think this is a reality, some people in every group, the organization is happy when they leave because they're troublemakers in quotation marks. They ask too many questions. They cause too many problems. So those are not necessarily the ones that they're going to be running after to get back, you know, but can demonstrate, see what happens to those troublemakers, you know, they're possessed by evil and therefore you've lost the grace of God and protection of God and now we're doomed to exist in the outside world blah blah blah, you know. 

So [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1599s) varies too. I mean I mentioned that because it's important to note that people's experiences also within the same group vary and the impact and the impact that it can have on them varies as well. And that can also depend on gender, you know, especially if you don't fit the right gender model that the group espouses to, that can be even more problematic for you while you're in and also when you're coming out after as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1629s)

Yeah, that's very true. 

**Mike Kropveld**

I guess what I'm trying to say with a number of things where I interject is that there's a certain kind of nuance. And because when people hear the word cult, they assume everybody's in the same group is at the same level is being treated harm and experiences is the same thing which is not the case.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1646s)

Yeah. Yeah. That's very true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I want to touch on a subject that I've been very, very curious about. Honestly, it's probably the place where I would put all my time and energy in. Um, it's to do with coercion laws in Canada. What do you, do you think like where do you think that could start? How do we start something that, do you think Quebec is a place to start it or what would be the best province to start something like that? Um and who would you start it with?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1679s)

Uh probably, I guess I would say yeah, probably province of Quebec would be a good place to start since I guess it tend in terms of exposure around this issue it tends to generate a lot of media attention, extreme. And uh a reason I'd say who you approach, I'd probably say based on the previous pre-COVID announcements by the Premier here in the province, I would approach the Premier directly because previous to the COVID, there were [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1710s) coming out about groups that were running basically illegal schools and dealing with the issue of children and his kind of basically astonishment that something like this should happen and be going on in this time, you know, in this time and place in the world. And so I would say approach prime and the premier directly and look at what can be done in terms of, because basically governments, their ability to do something is to make laws. Uh the question with [laws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1740s) obviously with any case is what is the impact and how do you implement it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1744s)

Yeah.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1744s)

It's the same with a lot of things that in in the work that we deal with is is there a willingness on the part of officials to actually implement existing laws when it comes to certain groups? Uh and that's a whole other issue, you know, because I I think there's a great reluctance often. It's still I guess in a certain mindset is that when you say religion, people, you know, kind of see that as a hot potato and a certain kind of assumption which I think people like to hold on to, which [clearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1774s) is demonstrated is not necessarily true, is that religion is good. 

Religion can be good and religion can be bad and problematic. As as I mentioned within most major mainline religions, the exposure of like, you know, sexual abuse etc. uh exists everywhere. But you know, getting people to move on dealing with situations which in a sense go beyond their realm of comprehension, see that's the big thing I guess is [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1804s) people really understand what's happening and going on and then looking at once we do understand what are the steps or what can we do to alleviate or resolve this kind of an issue? Tough question, but I would say get back to it, approach the premier directly and let him figure out who he should be handling it because he's the one to express great concern and astonishment by the fact that there were a couple of groups in this province that were basically running illegal schools and it was like a free-for-all when it came to dealing with kids and education.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1846s)

Another question, go ahead Carmen.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1849s)

I'm just gonna add something, it's like laws I think can be important but one should not see that as the be-all and end-all. In other words, you know, the law will now take care of this problem and everything is like we can wipe our hands and say it's finished. It's a step, you know, and you know, and should not be viewed as now once we get this, if we get this into place, that things will all be fine and dandy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1873s)

Well no, and we all know that, you know, laws aren't always implemented when they should be. Um yeah I guess it's just for me when I look at spread this all on to a table, to me it's like a hole that's missing in the foundation of trying to create a movement of accountability, right? I just feel it's a piece of the pie that's got a hole in it that hasn't been looked at. And I mean, we know in other countries that coercive laws have been brought in, but it's only been on a domestic family situation. It doesn't entail, I don't know anywhere in the world that has a coercive control law on groups.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1912s)

I don't know if they could do it specifically. I think the thing is you take laws the same way you have a law against fraud. You don't have a law on fraud dealing with X group or Y group. You have a law on fraud. So the same question is like if it's coercive control, you take a look at the law and does the situation with X or Y group apply, then you would use the law. Sexual abuse is not like geared to say anything or child abuse. It doesn't have in the law mark that child abuse in groups is child abuse. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1942s) so that's why I come back to the question of a willingness to intervene is to already use existing laws to deal with situations that are there. I mean, a number of cases that are coming up, you know, have come up in the province in terms of fraud, child abuse, sexual abuse etc. are using existing laws. 

But it requires sometimes a more inordinate amount of money and resources because you're not dealing with, you know, Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so family situation. You're [dealing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=1972s) with, is this a policy of a group? And if this is a policy of the group, how do we find out the information that will support an action if we're going to take it against the group or against leadership who have instituted this policy? And you always want to watch out to me that you're not going after the member who's the one who has everything in their name and the leader is basically hiding behind the members doing things that may be considered illegal like you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2002s) fraud etc. uh because I know situations where the leader basically doesn't have his name on anything, but it's in the name of certain members.

 So if there ever came a problem, who's going to get exposed? The member. The leader goes, "Wasn't me." I mean, so how do you prove that? That's why I'm saying you need the willingness to understand what's going on in these situations before proceeding, and then looking at how do you apply the existing laws to those situations. And not to say that it is difficult, but it is and it has been done. You know, there have been cases where you've got youth protection that have taken the time and resources to really build strong cases and groups. At the same time, you've got cases where they've done not so good a job as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2052s)

Yeah. Do you think the Department of Youth Protection offers sufficient protection for children in cults?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2061s)

Probably the easy way to answer that is yes and no. Because I think it's not an individual case. Like I said, I've dealt with youth protection in certain cases where they've done a really good job and taken the time to investigate. In other situations where, "No, no, don't worry about it. We know what we're doing. We know what we're doing." And it doesn't go anywhere. It varies. I mean, like the system, like much of our system is overwhelmed. We get a fair amount of calls over the course of a year from youth protection workers on certain cases. So there is a willingness to at least step out, find out information about a group, uh and try to understand more maybe how to proceed. 

That's something that we're also looking at is how to do more training that's going on a bit more in this province where certain, in turn now, sorry I don't even know the word in English, uh those who, you know, kind of the social workers and those who intervene in cases are becoming more trained and better for capable of dealing with it. The problem is it's a very high pressure job. That's why you want to train as many people as possible because you know one or two people aware of an issue in an area where they don't stay very long in that job position means there's very little continuity that goes on. So those are factors that [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2140s) look at when we propose and working on proposing trainings for professionals is try to get as many people aware. 

And it's it's like every area, you can do a certain amount of training information in one day but you're talking about an issue, like a lot of issues, which you're not going to become really expert or well versed in in just one day. And so you need the backup system where, and that's where it's come up a number of times, a number of times, this gives you [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2170s) bit of a sense of my age too, in 1980-81, the committee for the protect youth protection after dealing with an investigation to a group which they didn't mention in their report but it dealt with the group in the in the Laurentians in Quebec here, uh said after, you know, a number of studies and research uh dealing with this situation we find ourselves constantly back at square one. 

And so what they suggested is the need for more information, more resources and it's a ministerial kind of group [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2201s) get together because you know you're bringing up the organization you were in, well, you know, it can touch on many kind of departments. It can touch on revenue, touch on youth protection, can touch on education, you know, and so and then you know the public policy, you know, just on legal issues as well. And so the issue is you've got to issue them working independently rather than coordinating and that has been one that I think the lack, you know, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2231s) lack in they say here of dealing with some of these groups because it overlaps into many jurisdictions and they have not been working together.

 I mean I've sat around in meetings and it's kind of disheartening where we've had representatives from different government agencies who can't talk to each other because confidentiality reigns. So even even if they're, like I was sitting around with youth protection, social services, police, and nobody can talk to each other because [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2261s) not allowed to. So those are the things that have to be I think addressed when you're dealing with the kind of groups that we're dealing with because they fall into the mandates of different kind of departments and the need to coordinate it would make I think moving on situations much more let's say practical and easy as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2284s)

So so if I'm um interpreting you right, the the crying need is more for education rather than necessarily [changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2291s) in the law. The primary problem is people don't understand the concept of cultic coercive control. Is that fair?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2298s)

Well, part of it, I mean, I don't want to put down the suggestion of not instituting laws. The question then, if you're bringing in new laws, who's going to bring them in? And based on what kind of knowledge do they have with the issue that you're trying to formulate a law around. Now, course of control is a broader one. So it applies, you know, but if you're looking at laws that may apply [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2321s) specific groups or problems in specific groups, I don't know if you're going to get much headway on it. Because I think there will be reluctance. I think you want to look at situations which can be more broadly applied whereby if you're dealing with X or Y group, and you want to demonstrate coercive control, there's a law that we can potentially use to demonstrate that. But I tend to, I often get back when I'm asked that question is like, get people to move on the existing laws.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2345s)

Yes. I mean, you hear so many stories about basically cash being exchanged in these groups. I mean, you hear this story within a lot of areas, following the money is a common theme.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2356s)

Yeah, Yeah, well, follow the money, take a look at what's going on. Is there exploitation financially, people being exploited? Is there fraud? You know, people who are getting money, are they reporting it? I mean, it's sad to say that people are more concerned sometimes about cash than individuals. Rules, but it's a certain reality [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2382s) if the laws exist, why not pursue existing laws? Because you know, once there is I think sometimes pressure put on groups, you know, and on their pocketbooks and how they function, and sometimes when it coming to light in the public light, yeah that can affect, that can affect the change.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2398s)

You know, it may not be the kind of change one desires, but it can affect the change. But it's it's a process because coercive control is is a can be hard to prove. But you know, when it comes to forensic accounting, then you can get an extremely solid case. So that's the maybe their weakness is if they've strayed into criminality in that area, it's relatively easy to to prove, is that?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2427s)

Yeah, yeah I see [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2428s) easier. I mean it's not to just take away from other approaches because ultimately the question I guess behind all this is can you stop some of these groups from operating? You know, and I mean I think some groups have changed. Sometimes I think groups have stopped because the leader has died, the group has kind of split apart. Uh they've been, there's been really public exposure. But for large organizations, the question is, you know, I mean, somebody, a colleague of mine once said, if you look, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2458s) many groups have, let's say, in quotations, those who fought against them, closed down, versus how many of those fighters have been closed down. And I think there's been more fighters closed down, than there has been groups closed down. 

Not to say, and this is always a difficult thing, not to say you don't do it, you know, or try to do something. But, you know, are you putting your energy and resources in an area which is going to be practical or are you going to get the group to circle the wagons and just reinforce even more their conviction [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2488s) separation from the world, uh and you know, so that's what I'm saying. It's always a question of, I mean I I don't tell people what to do, right? When we people call, I say what is your goal? What do you hope to achieve? You know, you know, what are the pros and cons of the approach you want to use? You know, because ultimately you're the ones going to be doing it, you're the one that's to be comfortable with it. But you know, and if what you've been doing for years hasn't worked, why you continue? Is there maybe another way to [proceed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2518s)? Uh so it's not for me to say you shouldn't be doing or trying to close the group down that you feel uh is doing things that are unwarranted, improper, illegal, harmful. But you know, question is is like you know where are best interest put. And that's something I can't answer. That's an individual.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2538s)

I think that's a very, very good point. And I think we've long since realized that just closing the group down is unrealistic. [What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2549s) we do feel could happen and is realistic is that they could reform some of their more extreme policies, in particular the shunning and the excommunication, which isn't essential to their existence anyway. I mean, they could function without it. They can carry on without it. And as you say, I mean, particularly the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, they're acutely financially oriented. And if they were to lose their charitable status or [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2579s) that was threatened, they would gladly throw quite a lot of their principles out of the window to retain that. 

I mean, we've already seen them throw a lot of very long standing principles out for financial gain. So if it came down to it, they had to choose between carrying on with shunning or retaining their charitable status. I have no question the shunning would go out the window. And I think that's a realistic goal.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2601s)

Shunning is a tough one because first of all, it also depends on which country. I mean, a number of groups, let's say, have policy of shunning former members. The question, all we see from the group internally is we don't shun. Does this have an impact in terms of people who are former members posing too much of a risk and a problem for us as an organization? Yeah. At the same time, and in different, you know, I think there's been different cases around shunning within other groups. And generally, that's been considered like, people don't like it. You know, it's not kind of, let's say, something people would approve of. But in terms of like [legally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2642s) moving in and trying to change a group practices, I don't know if that's something that would work, you know, depending on the jurisdiction you're trying it in. 

But I think what your point you're making, which is exterior forces or external problems that are brought, let's say, and sometimes public exposure can have an impact. I'll just recount, this is on a smaller scale, there's a smaller group here in Montreal a number of years ago, run by a pastor, a local little church that had about maybe a dozen [members.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2672s) And he was sleeping with a 10-year-old that he basically claimed he had married. And people in the group knew this. This was kind of common knowledge, but they all kind of accepted it because they lived in this kind of closed environment. Once it became public and there was charges against him, even though he tried to defend himself as having married this 10 year old, everyone except one person left the group because it was kind of confirmation, confirmation from the outside that [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2702s) internally felt was wrong was now confirmed by what came out in the media. And so that had the impact of pretty much like closing and stopping the group. 

So that kind of pressure, depending on the movement can have an impact in terms of change, as well as the reality is having to adapt to changing times, membership, and then other questions that have come up within other closed groups as well, is what's happening to other generations? Are we losing a lot of second, third generation people, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2732s) our young people? Are they leaving? Do they want to belong? Those confront the group in other ways. you know and so you know I don't, you know, it would be up to people like yourself to figure out, okay, what's the best way to to move to try to affect change? And I guess I would probably say how to do it in the least confrontational way possible, you know, so that you don't get people, you know, up, you know, building walls versus like kind of [let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2762s) say like you were saying recognizing that maybe it's our best interest to adapt to changing times. 

A lot of institutions over time have changed. You know, why? Pressure from inside, pressure from outside that affects change over time. The sad part is some people want immediate change. And in some cases, it's a process. And and then it's also a question of when you talk about shunning, in some [groups,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2792s) I know, you know you're supposed to shun but not everybody really shuns. They just keep contact but they don't tell anybody you're still keeping contact. So you know, so is how do you build within those kind of networks as well? You know where people cannot let's say, I can't not talk to my son or daughter even though they left. So you do it on the side, which then indirectly can lead to the person maybe trying to pressure internally or there may be a number of people going [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2822s) a similar kind of situation that want to affect the change. They want to stay in the church but they don't want to see the church the way it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2830s)

I mean, and I have to say I've come up across a couple of those are very, very um supportive of of our movement that we've started but at the same time they want to see it become a mainstream Christian church again and not be this cultic association that they're in right now. I do have to say that I think one of the ways that we have found that's been very healing received by both ex-members and people in is by sharing people's stories. And I think, I mean to obviously people inside there, a lot of it must be very controversial to them. But at the same time, it's really created this huge ripple effect of especially people inside there who have never even really questioned the indoctrination that they were in to start kind of wake up and realize, wow, this isn't right. This isn't right. 

And I think that's the, for us, that is [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2892s) vehicle that we're driving right now is having ex-members be able to come on, tell their stories. Obviously it offers some healing to its on itself, right, um but I do, I, this is a marathon. I don't think that this is not going to be something that is going to be done quickly. I think this is something that takes dedication, persistence, um being on top of things. I had somebody else who, very, very another wise lady who said the same thing that you're saying [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2922s) follow the money. Go to where, like that was very much what she had said. Like it, that's where we need to go to to put pressure on because that is the most easiest fraud to be able to bring up and expose versus all the sexual abuse and I mean horrible abuse that comes through these stories.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2941s)

But I I think I would just underline one of the things you said that I think it's important that if you stick to your own story, you're basically saying this is what I went through, this is what I experienced. I'm not saying you went through it. So you're not basically making a generalization. This is what I went through and people then internally and elsewhere can say, "Huh, I can relate to that." Yes. It's not like I'm being attacked. I'm saying I left for X, Y reason. This is what I [experienced,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2971s) you know, and that I think has a much more profound impact than saying, "Oh, it's a cult, it's dangerous." Yeah, harming people. I think people that they shut off, you know, members are just going to shut off. And it's harder to shut off when you say, "I know, you may have it, you may be having a great experience." Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. This is what I went through. Yeah. And I think people can relate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=2995s)

And I mean, it's it's incredible people who have left like 50 years ago, you know, crying, being able to be, finally we get to speak about this. Let's get it off our chest. And the amount of healing that happens personally for a person is just, honestly, it's one of the most incredible things to watch.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3013s)

Yeah, that's one of the one of the things we found also with our support group because often and I think you probably experienced the same thing with your with your with your show, uh is that people often feel, "I'm alone." Yes. "I'm the only one that went through this." This is what we hear very often. And just the fact that being able to speak out and recognize you're not alone, and then with support groups as well, that uh you know it may not even be somebody who was in the same group but yeah, it's gone through something similar to what I went through.

 I think [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3043s) became very, yeah, you're saying a very healing experience as well as uh kind of like a certain kind of, you know, where you just kind of breathe a bit and say, "Okay, I'm not crazy." Yeah, yeah. Which is kind of what I've heard also from a lot of former members, because "I thought I was crazy because they're telling me I'm crazy for having left and I was a bad person, etc." And so it's very kind of like a really a great relief I think for people to recognize they're not alone and out [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3073s).

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3073s)

Yeah. Yeah. I have another question that someone wanted me to ask you. Um how do we counter the often used claim by cults that any questioning or intrusion is religious discrimination?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3086s)

I think part of it is like, the position we take is you're a religion, you claim to be a religion, fine, let's look at what you're doing. The same way I think you have an ability to question and criticize the functioning and actions of any organization. You know, I mean, why is religion immune to being asked questions? I would think that if you're in a more, I would say, kind of respectful religious organization, you would encourage people to ask questions so that their faith and conviction would be even firmer because [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3117s) getting the answers. So I mean that's the kind of a defensive mechanism when I say it's religious persecution. No, I'm asking questions about how you function, what your activities are, how you treat people, the same way I would ask that of any organization, the same way to ask that of the government, you know, so why is this considered anti-religious? 

I think that's kind of a nonsense kind of response. It basically says to me, you're not willing to answer any questions. And what have I asked you that is considered persecuting and opposed to your right to exist? Because our position is very clear. If you're a religion and you state your religion, you have a right to believe in what you want. You have a right to form around your religious belief. You do not have the right to do what you want. That's another question. And so those are the points that I would make.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3152s)

Wow. Yeah. Could you say something about, there's a lot of controversy about the use of the words, the word cult. And of course, that's even more confused when you get to the French because the words sect and cult interchange between French and English more or less. Can you, yeah, just just give us a comment on that terminology please.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3175s)

Oh yeah, there's some people that really like it or they're kind of like glued to the term and that we all know what a cult is. I mean cult in English is sect [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3204s) e in French. And people really, people really do screw that up because sometimes they'll say sect and then they'll say that in English, but a sect in English is not the same thing as the term cult. Sect is more a group that's separated from the main or a splintered off from a main group. Uh as you can people can find on our website, we don't list, we don't really do yes or no so because it's a label. And the question ultimately is, you know, when you use that label, what are you hoping to [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3234s) and find out? 

You know, what's the question behind it? People often want to know is X group or Y group a cult? And the question I often, sometimes I learned years ago, is now you're calling for that. Uh whatever, I would tell you the group is a cult, is everything okay now? And you're just going to say thank you very much, you're going to leave. And people say, "No, no, no, because I'm concerned about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Let's deal with your concerns. The person in a in a so-called cult, because often families have already told their parents [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3264s) relatives, "Hey, you're in a cult, why do you leave?" 

Nobody joins a cult. Cult has taken on such a negative connotation that, "Yeah, what do you think I'm crazy? No, I've got into cult. You don't know what you're talking about." So right off the bat, if you're using that to talk to somebody, you've created a wall which is limiting your communication. And so ultimately you want to deal with why do you want to know that and how is it going to help you? I've gotten cases where people call and say they want to know that is X group [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3294s) Y group a cult because they're in a divorce proceeding and so they think they can go in front of a judge and say X group is a cult, give me the kids. Yeah, not going to work because ultimately it's going to what are they doing, what's the impact on the kids? So you want to get down to what are your concerns? 

You know, the cult label does help for former members because it kind of puts in a framework around one's experience that helps understand the negative implications of what they went through. But from [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3325s) in terms of is it a cult yes or no is because the side question is it a religion yes or no? Or is it a cult? If the group is like I said before is incorporated as a religious group, I basically say it's a religious group. What are they doing and what's the impact? There's a lot of I guess labeling that goes on and I think one has to be very cautious and know the limitations of that word, especially today, you know, when we first started, when first I, we get into the whole [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3355s) of our name as well, which is Infocult. When we first started, cult had a much more neutral kind of definition was like, you know, people who follow a person, belief or an idea. Yeah, no negative. And in that period of time, people would sometimes talk about cults and destructive cults, to basically indicate, these were the harmful groups. 

But over time, the reality is this cult has taken on totally a negative term and becomes almost like a stop [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3385s) stoppage to talking to somebody. That's why for me it's like what do you hope to know and how is it going to help you? You know, and ultimately if it is a cult in your mind, how does that change the situation? You know, and if it isn't a cult, how does that change the situation? You know, because ultimately you wanted to know is like is it harmful? Uh that's what people want to know. Yeah, you know, it's hard to say yes or no, you know, because you want to know it [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3415s) obviously depending on the group. What we tend to look at is what is the potential risk? And looking at the structure of the group, is the risk or potential risk higher in this group because of X, Y factors compared to another group which, let's say, is maybe open, more tolerant, democratic, respectful, versus a group that's more closed, intolerant, no respect for criticism or other people's opinions, run by a very tight authoritarian structure. 

Then the more you get to those extreme end, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3446s) more potential risk there is for individuals. And depending on the group, is the risk higher for women? If you happen to have a guru or a leader who likes to sleep with the women or sleep with the kids? So you're looking at all these factors in each group. So it's where do you place the group on a continuum, for me is much more helpful than putting all these groups who are a cult in one basket, and all these groups who are supposedly not a cult in another, because that's problematic too, because [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3477s) have a list, you know, what kind of list? Is it inclusive? You know, so I'm always, like we mentioned on our website, we don't have a list of groups and of cults, and we have no plans or intentions of doing it and we explain a bit why, you know. But it it is an area of controversy. Uh people don't like that, you know, our position of vis-a-vis that and because for some people it is very clear what is a cult and what isn't, and it's not that, it's not that actually a clear division, it's a [spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3507s).

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3508s)

Yeah, that's how we see it though. And recognizing I think, you know, if you want that kind of simplistic answers, you're falling into a certain kind of mindset, in my opinion, which is cultic also, which is now we know what's good. Now we know what's bad. Life should be so easy that we can find things like that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3524s)

It might be interesting to actually do the exercise of actually drawing a spectrum and with certain criteria and seeing where different groups fall along that spectrum because it's sometimes very helpful. I mean if I'm talking to people about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, they're small groups, they're not very well known, so then you have to find some comparisons. So what I often say to people, well they're quite similar to Jehovah's Witnesses but they're more strict in these areas, but they have the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3563s) shunning practice and so on. So it's actually helpful rather than just putting them all into a bin to say, well, there's these groups here, they all have similar practices. And then if it's a group that people know of, then that educates them about the group they don't know of.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3577s)

I think it's helpful because that way you get into more precision about discussing certain structures, behaviors, and so that's more helpful in saying they're more closed than, for example, like the Jehovah's Witnesses [send](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3593s) their kids to public schools, Exclusive Brethren don't. So you're looking on the continuum, you're putting them a bit more to the extreme necessarily of the Jehovah's Witnesses on certain practices. And Jehovah's Witnesses will talk to people outside the community, will hang out with others who are not members versus, let's say, so that helps to explain more structurally rather than yes, no, good, bad, etc. And I think that would be probably more helpful in getting people a more clear idea or a clearer idea where like you're saying placing the school.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3628s)

Um I also wanted to, I wanted to just share your website just so I can show people where they can um help support your cause because I'm sure um you are in always in need of donations uh.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3647s)

Yeah, we, like any organization, needs funds and just like we do as well. Exactly. I would and for those that are interested, uh we try to be as transparent as possible. So our annual reports, our financial statements are all, I think, yeah. So we try to, like I say, be as open and upfront as possible because we're often, we're obviously dealing with an issue where we see most groups are kind of closed and not transparent. So we don't we want to be as [transparent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3677s) and open as possible as we can be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3679s)

Yeah and there's an excellent video here for people to watch. Let me just move my little thing here. Um there's an excellent video but I really wanted to, um so here's the contact information for people and I wanted to go to the donate. So the donate button is definitely just at the very top here. And there's different ways of donating and when, what do your donations go towards?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3707s)

Amazing. Yeah, like I say, you see our financial statement. Most of the funds go to right now, there's there's myself who's playing full-time and I have two other people working with me part-time uh in our operation. And then the rest is like our office and the rest of the funding goes to pretty much smaller items like phone, you know, electricity, but most of it is just for the staffing of having the organization run. But like I say, you people look at the financial reports, they're on site [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3737s) because we do get government funding, these have to be kind of reports that we also send it to the government as well as because we're a charity, this has to go to Revenue Canada as well. It's all like public information. 

Yeah, which is an interesting note, if an organization is a charity, people may be interested to know. If you're in Quebec, organizations that are registered, it's public. You can find out their status by going to the Regisseur des Entreprises. If there are charity, information on their funding [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3767s) money that they claim at least publicly to have is public information and is accessible through the Charities Division of Revenue Canada. There's an amazing amount of information that people want to look that is available and is kind of accessible to the public.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3784s)

Yeah and I, we have very much done that with the charities that are inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Yeah.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3792s)

So you see where the money, where the money goes to and what your contributions go to.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3797s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean we're we're we're very concerned recently because the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church had a fundraiser and from the presentation of their fundraiser and the donation forms they put out, it appeared that they were sending the funds to an overseas endowment fund in Australia. And when you look up that endowment fund in Australia, on their government registration for that endowment fund, it says they're not entitled to issue tax receipts. But yet on the donation form in Canada, it said they'll give you a tax receipt for your donation, which [seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3840s) very inexplicable.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3841s)

The Canadian, no if you donate it to a Canadian institution, they will give you the tax receipt. Yeah, then they, depending on, I don't know the legalities, are sending their money to another organization. Charities sometimes do that. The charity in Australia, for example, doesn't have to issue a tax receipt necessarily. But the charity in Canada would probably issue a tax receipt for your donation.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3863s)

So the question then becomes, is the Canadian [charity,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3870s) are they allowed to send those tax receipted funds overseas to a non-charitable organization? And then the problem is it then becomes a very complicated financial question to unravel all these sort of international network. But it's a good question.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3888s)

I don't know, in terms of law, but charities, but sending money to a non-charitable organization. I don't know, you could ask Revenue Canada, you know, what are the rules and regulations about disbursement of funds that come in? And how that works. But I do know that there's a number of charities that raise money for causes outside the country. So, but in terms of the legality of anything, that's beyond me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3918s)

Yeah. We really need a charity expert to help in that kind of following the money trail, because when it gets to international financial transfers, it's complicated to follow. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3938s)

So if there's anyone out there listening that can help us on this, we would welcome your expertise.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3943s)

Yeah that's that's an area like me off with with the same thing is that when you hear about offshore tax shelters and money diverted to this company then then diverts it to others I don't know, you really like you're saying need somebody who really knows the ins and outs of how that works, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3961s)

Yeah. Well Mike I really, really appreciate you coming on. I think this was a very much needed podcast. And I'm yeah, I'm just in awe over your knowledge. And it helps me change some perspectives I've had and kind of where my arrows been pointed might get changed into a different direction. It was very informative.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3989s)

Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3990s)

Thank you so much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3992s)

The invitation. And Mike, you've been dedicated to this work for what, 40 years or more now?

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=3997s)

Yeah, well, that's a whole other story of explaining. I mean, shortly I got involved in this in the 70s because of a close friend's experience in Unification Church. To make a very long story short, the experiences we had and it's a story in itself, we ended up kidnapping, deprogramming. This is epic 1970s, 80s kind of story [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4022s) kidnapping, deprogramming our friend out of it. And another friend of ours, for Canadians who may know him, Josh Freed, who's a journalist and a friend, wrote up the series of articles on our experience, which is subsequently published into a book and an award-winning film called Ticket to Heaven, which is all still available online. That generated a lot of publicity, which got me interested in other people at the time to try to put something together. Like I said, long story [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4053s) probably less than a minute, which took up a whole book when it was written by the journalists.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4059s)

Well, we'd really love to just thank you for your dedication, because I'm sure you've helped countless numbers of people. And you've made an awful lot of lives better in the course of your career, so more power to your elbow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4072s)

Thank you. Thank you.

### [**Mike Kropveld**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4074s)

Very much, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcUmjSACwA&t=4075s)

Thank you so much and thanks everyone for, oh yeah, go ahead.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
