## Summary

For a community of compassionate and caring Christians, the PBCC businesses tend to get the opposite reviews from former non-community members. Matthew's story isn't anything new to us, but still is heart wrenching to listen to. The comments on social media, messages, and emails sent to us by former and current employees all have the same theme - it's a toxic, misogynistic, and racist environment to work in. In Matthew's case, having an 18 year old daughter of his own was the catalyst that made him leave. He couldn't imagine his daughter being treated the way these PBCC members treated others.
What started out as an incredible job, Matthew quickly realized that all they wanted him for was his expertise and not to maintain dignity or a safe workplace emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. The workplace became very toxic, with PBCC members being caught taking pictures up girl's skirts, alcohol everywhere, and misogyny he couldn't bear to witness. Accountability was not given to the girl who was violated, but rather, she was let go, and the perpetrator got to keep his job. He was told another girl was only hired for her looks. He quickly realized they did not value women at all.
Matthew spoke his mind and asked questions! He takes us on his 2 year journey of homophobia and racism, alcohol in the workplace, getting ready for Dean Hales and how he actually ate with them. In his words- he never saw any signs of the values they speak of and reiterates he would NEVER work for another PBCC company ever again. He sends a potent message after recording this episode on how much they disliked ex-members. It's nothing new to us but Bruce definitely isn't showing his flock how to have care and compassion to others that have left like they say they are.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=5s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl, and today joining us guests are Ben Woodbury and Cassie Davies. All three of us are ex-members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, or Exclusive Brethren. Today we have a very special guest, Matthew, joining us from Sydney, Australia. Welcome, Matthew.

You, Matthew, just recently resigned from a PBCC business and he's here to tell us about what that experience was like. But first of all, Matt, we just want to check in and see how you are doing, since this just happened a few days ago. How are you doing?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=41s)

I'm doing fantastic. That's awesome. Really good, yeah, really good.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=46s)

That's perfect. So I guess one of our very first questions we would like to know is, what was the ultimate reason for you quitting your job with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=58s)

Just a toxic, very toxic culture inside that business. It's horrible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=66s)

And were you aware of their religious affiliation when you were, were you made aware of it when you first joined?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=74s)

I was, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=76s)

And how did they describe that to you?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=78s)

They just told me that they were Brethren. I wasn't aware of the Brethren, I'd never heard of them before, and I was just told Christian, basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=90s)

Yeah, so not necessarily how exclusive they were.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=94s)

No, no, no, no. I wasn't told any of that stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=97s)

And when you first started working there, in your earlier days, did you notice any red flags right off the bat, or was it something that kind of grew as you, the more time you spent there?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=112s)

It grew the longer I spent there. It was very good at the start. The business, yeah, it was really good at the start. The business had put in a new plant, of which I'm an expert on, and they needed my expertise to start off with. And you know, I bought a whole team on. So they were very nice to start off with. It was a very nice, good period, say for the first six months or so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=143s)

And then what started happening?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=144s)

Just lies and a lot of deceit. There was favoritism. You know, there's some, a lot of staff were protected, should I say, community members.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=159s)

Like the PBCC members that worked there were protected?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=162s)

Correct, correct. Extremely protected.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

And that is a general feedback we do here. It's a very biased atmosphere to work as a non-community member. It's biased towards members. Yeah, we do hear that a lot.

### **Matthew**

Oh, it's extremely biased.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=188s)

Can you give us any examples of that?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=190s)

So, one example, a gentleman that works there, I won't mention any names, was accused of taking photos up another young lady's skirt.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

A community member?

### **Matthew**

Correct. And he was taking photos up a young girl's skirt. She was a PBCC member also. The young girl resigned, and the young gentleman remains in the business. In any other business, heâ€™d be fired..

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=234s)

The other way around.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Oh my God. You know, Matthew, this is not the, I haven't ever shared this story, but this happened with my sister. She came to me and showed me screenshots of a male Brethren married guy grooming her. He even sent her a dick pic and asked her to meet him out the back. So she worked for my dad, and essentially, he was off for four weeks, and my sister went back to work. He ended up saying that, like he appeared back at work, and my sister [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=265s) to my dad and was like, "Why is he back here?" And he said, "Oh, he's a householder, you're not. So we're going to find you a job somewhere else." So totally discarded the victim's plight and went and put this known abuser back into work. And she was, you know, discarded, his own flesh and blood. So this is not an unfamiliar story.

### **Matthew**

Unbelievable. So, that young gentleman remains in the business. Nothing, there was nothing, nothing happened.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Protect the brand, right?

### **Ben Woodbury**

Protect the brand. Protect the franchise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=305s)

And you know what? This is how the sexual abuse happens in there, right? It's because these people get away with shit like this. I mean, and that's not even small. I don't want anybody out there thinking that this is small, but in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, it's small.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=323s)

So we weren't supposed to know about that. That was very, you know, there was a big secret there. It just happened to be another non-community member female that worked in the office who the young girl confided in, and you know, she told the rest of the guys outside in the warehouse, I guess.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=346s)

That's sad.

### **Cassie Davies**

It's so sad that it takes outside members that might not even walk the same Christian faith to stand up and go, "This is not okay." And you know, the Brethren pride themselves on being this testimony of, you know, "peculiar people zealous for good works." They're anything but that. And this toxic male culture is so rife within every Brethren business. And like, we're in totally different areas and businesses, and it's the same thing.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=378s)

It's the same thing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=378s)

How long did you work there?

### **Matthew**

Two years.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

You worked there for two years?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=385s)

Yep, just on two years.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=387s)

And did you ever witness any kinds of racism?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=391s)

Oh, absolutely. I once wanted to hire another gentleman that had worked for me in another business, and he's from Sri Lanka.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=411s)

Okay.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=412s)

And I did mention that to my boss. I actually recorded this. And his reply was, "I don't hire Indians." And I said, "Excuse me?" He said, "Yeah, I don't know if an Indian..." This is what I replied to him with, "He's not Indian, he's Sri Lankan." He said, "They're the same."

### **Ben Woodbury**

Oh, this is how uneducated they are. This is what happens when you're stuck in a cult.

### **Matthew**

It's unbelievable. I said, "He's not Indian," and he just replied with that, "They're the same. I don't hire Indians." And since then, to be fair, there has been, I think one Indian there, but that was early on, and that was the response that I got.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=462s)

Well, the only reason he'd be there is because they desperately need his skills.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=468s)

Yeah, yeah, correct. Which is, and that was apparent, that became apparent to me about 12 months in, is that's the only reason that I was there. They put in a new plant, and I was an expert on the plant, and they needed me. I also took a team of 13 guys with me, so they needed that. And then once I'd got things sorted out for them, they were quite happy for me to move on.

### **Ben Woodbury**

I mean, [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=498s) all of that, Jesus, that's like a work cover case waiting to happen. You need to name and shame this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=508s)

Were job advancements and salary treated fairly amongst everyone, or were PBCC community members treated differently?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=515s)

I'm not sure.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=518s)

Okay, you didn't know that. Yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=519s)

I'm not sure what the PBCC guys got paid. I do know I got paid extremely well. And I now understand, oh, I wouldn't say extremely well, I did get paid well. But I have since spoken to other people that have worked in community businesses, and I believe that they pay over for us because it's very hard to put up with their quirky... it's very different. It's not like working for a normal business.

### **Ben Woodbury**

You're allowed to say it's very hard to put up with their toxic [environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=549s).

### **Matthew**

Well, yeah, that's exactly the issue.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=554s)

Yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=555s)

We did have other women work there, and this is one of the things that led, I sort of got to the point, it sort of got to boiling point a week or so ago, and the way that women are treated within their businesses is just absolutely disgusting. Just pathetic.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Is that non-Brethren and Brethren members?

### **Matthew**

I think both, but more so the non-Brethren women. There were two that worked there. So many times I've seen them crying, and you know, there were sexist and unfair comments made towards them. And I'm a father, I have a daughter. I just, you know, that sort of got on my nerves after a while. I couldn't put up with it any longer. It's not cool.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=607s)

Can you share what some of those comments are?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=611s)

One of them, I won't mention the name, she was hired to help out in the office. And she started to get involved in some other stuff outside in the warehouse, helping. And the comment was made, she was told that she was to clean and do the laundry, because we had facilities there to wash clothes and whatnot. And she was hired to cook, because they used to cook for us on Fridays, and clean. "That's it. Don't worry about anything else. That's what you're here to do." And I thought it was super rude.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Wow.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Very sexist.

### **Matthew**

It is.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=651s)

But that's what the women there are for, though. That's what you're raised for.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=653s)

This is how they treat women in their wider circle, right? Like my mom was just there to cook and clean, and you girls could vouch for that.

### [**Cassie and Cheryl**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=661s)

Yep.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=664s)

Yeah, that's just, as a father, my daughter's 18, like that's unbelievable. I would hate for somebody to treat her like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=675s)

Yeah. Did you witness any forms of homophobia?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=678s)

Oh, absolutely. Many times, many, many times. On one occasion, I went into Sydney, the CBD, to look at a job with the operations manager, actually, who is a community member. And it was last year during Mardi Gras, and there were all flags, you know, Mardi Gras signs and flags throughout the city. And it really made him angry.

### **Ben Woodbury**

I can [imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=715s).

### **Matthew**

Yeah, he went on a rant then, bragging about, I think he mentioned something about the schools, their OneSchool Global, and how, you know, because it's part of their curriculum, I think, these days here in Australia, that children are educated about this stuff. He told me that they went to court or something, and he was very, very proud of the fact that it's not part of their curriculum. They don't have to teach their children about that because it's not, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=746s) know, not what they believe or whatever.

### **Ben Woodbury**

The hypocrisy with that is that whilst they are a minority, a very small minority, they are the first to squeal and scream when somebody's discriminating against or has a question about their 16th-century beliefs. But they are quite happy to attack another minority, be that racial, be that sexual, you know, be that a gender orientation. They're the first to squeal, though, when anybody questions their [toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=789s) community.

### **Matthew**

As a matter of fact, you were actually mentioned.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Of course.

### **Matthew**

Yes. Because I did ask one of the older gentlemen there, I questioned him about what his thoughts were and what he knew about the ATO raids, because that was quite the topic of discussion the last few weeks on the warehouse floor.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=816s)

I mean, the audit, the standard audit.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=818s)

Yeah, the standard audit, the regular audit, the regular surprise audit. Yeah, that was quite the topic of discussion. And I questioned one of the older gentlemen there about it, and he said, "Ah yeah, there's a lot of people trying to cause trouble for us at the moment." And he said, "There's this Ben guy," excuse my wording here, Ben, he said, "You're a faggot."

### **Ben Woodbury**

[It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=849s) doesn't surprise me.

### **Matthew**

And he just went on this whole rant about homosexuals and the trouble that is being caused for the community by a couple of, he mentioned some other fellow too that's from New Zealand, I think.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Oh, the one that they chemically castrated.

### **Matthew**

The one that they actually told me chemically castrated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=873s)

Yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=873s)

He actually told me that. He actually told me that story and told me that he asked the doctor for that because he wanted to not be gay.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, because of course we didn't want to be gay. You taught us all our lives not to. We had to overcome the fact that we hated being gay, it was the biggest thing ever. You taught us all our lives that we were better off to die than to be gay, so of course we didn't want to. We knew the cost of it, losing our beloved family and friends. So of [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=903s) we didn't want to be gay. But this sounds like a very uneducated person, and probably the type of guy that would take a kid that reports child sex abuse. That's the type of person that would be like, "Oh yeah, you know," the girl that had a photo taken up her skirt, he'd be the type of guy that would be like, "It's her problem. What did she do to ask for it?"

### **Matthew**

Ignorant, uneducated, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=929s)

I know who Matthew is referring to right now. And this same person that he had a conversation with actually had another community member go and stay with him, and he did nothing about the sexual abuse that had gone on with her too.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=944s)

There you go.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=945s)

Yeah, there you go. She had talked to him about it. I went and asked her, I did ask her the story, and he didn't do anything. And I think what she told me is that his counselor, his counselor-lawyer, had told him not to get involved in it. Which, as your, that is your responsibility as a priest who's taking care of another person who's come from another country over to Australia to take care of. That's your job. That is your job as [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=976s) new priest taking care of them, is to report that kind of stuff. And he still didn't. So I wasn't surprised when you told me this story that it was this guy who had called Ben and Craig Hoyle a faggot. Not surprised, not surprised at all.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=989s)

Yeah, well, at the end of the day, these faggots don't harbor abusers. We don't. And the sex that we have with other people is consensual. Have a think about that.

### **Matthew**

Crazy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1003s)

Yeah. Did you ever witness like alcohol at the workplace or people coming in drunk or hungover?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1014s)

Every day. Absolutely. Every day. They had alcohol there, oh, cupboards full.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Wow.

### **Matthew**

Cupboards full. We had one of the ladies that worked in the office, her job was to keep that sort of stuff stocked up. And she'd often tell some of my staff and myself, you know, she just spent five, six thousand dollars on whiskey and gin and whatnot to fill the cupboards upstairs. And you know, often on a Friday afternoon, you'd see members of the management team or the sales team strolling around with a glass of whiskey in their hands. You know, like they think they're someone special.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1070s)

Would they ever be drinking and then going on tools?

### **Matthew**

No, no, no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1074s)

Would they drive home, though, or did they have someone to drive them home?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1080s)

Oh, they drive home. They brag about drink driving. I myself sort of stopped drinking 12 months ago, actually, just as I started at their business, maybe two years ago. Sort of gone on this health journey. And they try and push it on me. We'd have work functions and, "Have a beer, have a beer, have a whiskey." And like, I remember one time I said I'd have one, I think it was the first Christmas party. "Alright, I'll have one." I said it to one of the, well, my manager, and he went and poured me a whiskey. And when he brought it back, the whole glass was straight whiskey, and he just put the tiniest bit of ginger ale in it. I said, "I'm not drinking that." He said, "Yeah, you'll be fine. Just use the app Waze, it tells you where the police are. Just use Waze and you'll get home safe. We all use Waze, we never get pulled over." And I just said no. I tipped it out in front of him. I said, "I'm not drinking that. I'm going to drive." And the rest of them just, yeah.

### **Ben Woodbury**

It's a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1142s), from what I've seen, it seems as though it's a super alcoholic culture.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Very toxic.

### **Cassie Davies**

Yeah, it's very... And this is the thing too, Matthew. Like, you have this culture, right, at breaks or dinners or whatever they want to call them, where if you don't drink, or somebody who doesn't, they push it on you, like what you experienced. But even more so, to the point where you do it just to shut them up. Like even to the women. I know some women that have spoken to me that they were the same. They [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1172s) did, and it was the men that were like, "Oh, why don't you just have one? Maybe you'll loosen up a bit. Maybe you won't be so, you know, up yourself." And it's a very, very toxic drinking culture. And then look at the accidents that have happened.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1186s)

That's what I was going to say. I wanted to ask, did they talk, so these most recent accidents, I'm like, do you know about them? So they've had some pretty devastating accidents just recently. I was wondering if they had talked about it at all.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1197s)

Not to me, no. I hadn't spoken about them. Actually, I did ask the old fella about them, and he said, "Oh, I've seen one in America."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1207s)

Yeah, the one that killed that, yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1210s)

Yeah, and I asked about that, and he just said he wasn't a community member. I said, "Okay."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1217s)

Oh, yes he was. Yes, he was. His dad wasn't, but he was.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1222s)

Okay. I didn't go any further with that. I did ask him, and he just said, "Oh no, that wasn't a community member." I knew that it was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1228s)

And I think he's, what you're referring to, the Clayton Hughes one, where there was, yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1235s)

I just, yeah, I just left it at that. But this is classic, right? They just wash their hands of anything they don't want badly attached. Like anything that will affect their image. "Oh, they're not part of us."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1248s)

So he probably won't be for much longer. They'll just turf him out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1253s)

Yeah. So you were there just recently. So was this alcoholic culture still going when you left?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1259s)

Oh, absolutely. Yeah, the Friday before I left, one of the staff from upstairs in the office was walking around with a whiskey in his hand that afternoon.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1271s)

Yeah. And so I just want to remind the listeners and viewers that there was just a very, very tragic accident that just happened, when was that, Cassie? Like just over a week ago?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1283s)

Yeah, I think it was the 3rd of April. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1286s)

And so this drinking is still happening post-that accident.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1293s)

We don't know whether that accident was...

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

No, exactly, I know. Exactly. But what I'm trying to get at is that any kind of those accidents should shake them up inside there and clean up where they can clean up, right? Not at all am I insinuating that that accident had alcohol related to it, not at all. But I'm just saying that those accidents that do happen should make you look at your lifestyle.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1319s)

Yeah, 100 percent, 100 percent. And also, you know, I'm very open about having therapy, and I was talking to my therapist about it. And he said that it's a known thing in psychology that it's a form of self-harm. It's a form of self-harm where you have to drink to a point of disassociation from your reality. And that is the case when you're in such a toxic environment that is the cult, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### **Matthew**

Unbelievable. I never once heard them talk about their religious beliefs or anything like that, ever. To me, it doesn't seem like a very religious organization. It's a business. They make money. That's how I see it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1369s)

That's a pretty powerful statement coming from you, who's never been in it, that you never witnessed them being religious.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1377s)

What's that testimony there?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1379s)

Yeah, I was going to say that, Cassie. Like, they have this whole thing, Matthew, where they're like, "Oh, the testimony, you know, you're going to be a good image to the rest of the world." Yeah, okay, there's some feedback for you.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1390s)

Yeah, what image did you get, Matt? What image did you get?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1394s)

The ignorant and alcoholic image, basically.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Wow.

### **Cassie Davies**

It's really sad because we've got family members that cannot see out of it. Like, cannot see a world out of it. And it's so sad.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Within the Brethren system, right, within that world, we were all from different tiers. There's a distinct pecking order, like Animal Farm, you know, "all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others." Did you notice that? Like, did that flow over into the business?

### **Matthew**

Yes, I did. I did. You could tell who was, yeah, they clearly treated people differently. And you could tell, you know, that guy thinks he's better than that guy. Which is another thing that actually blew me away. Like, I don't understand why you're any better than me or I'm any better than you. I don't get it.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah. And did you ever hear the name Hales?

### **Matthew**

Oh yeah. Early on, very early on when we first started the manufacturing line and opened the warehouse, Dean Hales, I believe, came through. And it was a big, it was a big deal. "Oh, Dean's coming, you know, everything's gotta be perfect." And I made the comment, "I don't give a... who's Dean? He's nobody to me." "Oh, he's very important to us." And it was a really big deal. He was a shareholder in [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1485s) business at one point, I believe.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Of course.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1488s)

When they were profitable, no doubt.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1490s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that was a super big deal that he was coming through. And I said, "I don't care. I don't know who this guy is." And they weren't too happy when I said that.

### **Ben Woodbury**

No, I can imagine. You're slandering their royal family.

### **Matthew**

Just that, yeah. But other than that, I didn't hear their name really. No, not too often, if at all. Actually, one of my colleagues asked the boss about Bruce Hales. He asked, "Who is he?" Because obviously he's been in the papers and on social media a bit lately with the, what are we calling them? Audits. And so my colleague asked the boss about him and who is he and whatnot. And the response was, "He's like our Pope. He's like the Pope to us." That was the response that my colleague got about Bruce Hales when he asked who he is.

### **Ben Woodbury**

They clearly aren't very in touch with the outside world. Like, they'd understand that's not actually a cool brag.

### **Matthew**

We actually had a laugh about that because, yeah, that is [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1572s) cool.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, I mean, so he harbors kiddy fiddlers too.

### **Matthew**

Yeah, yeah. One thing I should mention about working in a Brethren business, I'm not sure if it's the same across the board, but they don't invest in their people. So I've been around a little now and managed different businesses and whatnot. And, you know, an important part of any business is putting something into your staff or educating your staff. There was no training or no education [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1610s) the non-Brethren staff members there whatsoever.

And often, you know, there may be, I think, what's it called, UBT? Yeah, they might do like a seminar or something, and the Brethren community staff would be a part of that and zoom in. But there was never any training or development for non-Brethren staff at all. And it was [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1641s) apparent. The Brethren community, so the management in that business anyway, in the New South Wales branch, the Melbourne branch was very professional. In the New South Wales branch, people were just put in roles clearly because they're community members, not because they had the skills to perform that role.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, yeah, that happens all over. Like, I had somebody in here in my shop actually recently saying to me they just quit, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1671s) two kids came out of school and were put immediately above them. And you know, you could just tell that they were favored community members and had no idea, no experience, no education. And what you say about education is so accurate because they don't believe in education. They believe in sending the kids to school because they have to, giving them the basic education, and then stopping it there.

And like you say, they bragged about editing the curriculum and making it work for them. Well, it's the same thing. They only want them to know [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1701s) works for their bigger molds, you know, their ecosystem, their cult. So they don't want them questioning anything. They don't foster critical thinking. They turn it inwards. They don't want you to critically analyze anything outside of yourself because then that means you would question the cult, right? And then you wouldn't be there. And that's why none of the kids have educations or accolades in terms of academics. They don't go to university because they don't want you to question what they [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1731s) you. So that's why you'll see that. Unbelievable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1736s)

How did your exit out go? Like, did it go well or was it, did it get heated?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1747s)

In the end, it seemed as though it was going to be quite heated, but it went well. It was quite, you know, they were, yeah, look, I'd say it was fine. They were happy to see me go because I think they don't like people speaking out against them or pushing back. They don't like people pushing back on them.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, correct.

### **Matthew**

I'm quite a strong personality. They don't like that at all. They just want you [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1777s) say yes, just go to work and do as you're told, basically, where I don't work like that. So they weren't very happy with that.

### **Ben Woodbury**

And I think they're going to find that very hard in the 21st century to find people that actually go to work like that. People go to work for what they believe in. You're at work, right? So you want to make sure you have the same values, ethics, morals. And they're finding it very hard. I know this firsthand. They're finding it very hard to find people. That's why they have to offer [such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1807s) glossy pay packets to put up with that environment.

### **Matthew**

Okay, yeah, it makes sense. And that's what I was saying earlier. I got paid well, and I now understand why. It's because they need to pay people well to put up with them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1824s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1827s)

It was very hard working for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1833s)

That's what I was going to ask next. I wanted to get into that. How did it impact your daily life working for them?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1838s)

It's just frustrating. I've been doing this, I've been working in the same industry for 20 years, just come just over 20 years now. And everything has to be done their way. It's not necessarily the right way, or it's not the right way at all. It's not the most efficient way. It's just their way. They're not receptive to any ideas. They don't take ideas from you. Everything must be their idea, and that's it. They don't [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1868s) to hear it. Just do as you're told and we'll pay you, basically.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's for someone like myself, it's very frustrating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1882s)

There were obviously women community members working there. How would you suggest they were treated? Did you notice how they were treated while working there?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1893s)

No, because I didn't work directly with them. A comment was made to me by one of the management, actually. They were young girls, when I say young girls, yeah, straight out of high school, basically 18, 19\. They both moved on, they both left quite a while after. I was walking through the warehouse with my direct report, and there was a box, and it had one of the young girls' names on it. And he looked and he went and sort of made a funny noise. And he said her name and he goes, "She was so..." what did he say? He said, "Ditzy. What did you think of her?" And I said, "I thought she was a nice young girl." He said, "Ah, she was only hired for her looks," and then sort of just left it at that. I said to him, "That's disgusting. She is the age of my daughter."

### **Ben Woodbury**

Wow.

### **Matthew**

And he just didn't say anything after that. I said I found that disgusting.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

How old was he?

### **Matthew**

He was my age, 40\.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised, right? You've got somebody there photographing up a girl's skirt, and they make the girl leave. You know, she would have been made to resign. And this is the culture that you're dealing with on a wider... relate them to... related, actually. Even less surprising, unfortunately. Even less surprising. That's unspeakable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1983s)

Wow, wow, wow. I'm just trying to go back to other things that have happened when we've had other people come on and talk about workplace. What was the workplace safety like inside there?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=1994s)

Say for the first year, year and a half, it was almost non-existent. There wasn't, there were no talks of workplace safety at all. Just recently, in the last, actually, I'd say 12 months, they've really started to have a major, I'm not saying major, focus on safety. But up until that, there were no cares about safety, really.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2020s)

Yeah, yet they still drink. They still have alcohol there, and they drink. So this alcohol drinking happens while they are in their work hours, right?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2031s)

Absolutely. Yeah, definitely for a couple of them, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2038s)

Wow. And are those ones higher up on the ladder in the workplace?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2043s)

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, they really only started focusing on the safety because there was an incident. Someone got hurt, and there was an investigation, which is why the major focus on safety.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Like an investigation with WorkCover?

### **Matthew**

Yeah, yeah, WorkCover.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2066s)

Wow.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Was any of the harassment, like the sexual harassment or anything like that, reported to WorkCover or reported to...?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2068s)

I don't think so. No, no, no. Once, I know when the guy was taking photos up the younger's skirt, that was dealt with internally. Like I said, we're not supposed to know about this. Another female from the office told everybody. But the MD came to site, and he spoke to whoever was involved and dealt with it. They dealt with it internally. So us non-community members weren't supposed to know about that one.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Of course. Don't affect the image.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

So with that, how old was the person that took the photo, like the guy?

### **Matthew**

Yeah, he's a young guy as well. Yeah, okay, 20s.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

And was he like higher up in the Brethren world? Is that why he was let off? I mean, it doesn't really matter because they're all let off, essentially.

### **Matthew**

I'm not sure with that one. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2130s) was higher up, like his family name was higher up in the business.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Well, there you go.

### **Matthew**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, his relatives were. So yeah, at the time, his uncle was my boss. So yeah, and I believe a shareholder now. So I guess that did affect the outcome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2158s)

What did you notice around the workplace when they would have their meetings? So when they would be off on a Friday or off during the week, what was the preparation for that that you would see from the inside there? And what did you witness when one of those things would take place?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2178s)

Just a lot of excitement, basically, from them. And there'd be a lot of talking. Now, I presume these meetings are of religious significance, but all that was ever spoken about was the copious amounts of alcohol that they'd be drinking with their guests from overseas.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2200s)

Wow.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2202s)

Bragging, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2205s)

And I mean, this is not the first time we've heard this, right? Like, we get the same reports from clear across the entire globe. Everybody says the same thing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2219s)

And I was talking to somebody recently, like an academic about this, and they're like, it's such a juvenile, undeveloped, almost brain mentality to be bragging and boasting about. Like, it's something kids in high school do about sneaking alcohol, having so much alcohol, or you know, the car doing a burnout. Sort of that schoolyard mentality. And you keep, and I was like, "Oh my God, yeah, you're so correct." Like, you see the way it sort of spills over, and [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2249s) people hold on to this.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2251s)

And that's their only outlet.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2252s)

Yeah, I guess. I was about to say that. Looking from the outside looking in, it's one of the only things they have, I can see now. Like, they don't have anything else, I guess. They're so afraid. And they're just not allowed to do anything else, really.

### **Cassie Davies**

And I guess it's the same with the women's side of things. Like, it's their house, their interiors. Like, that's all they care about. The [fussiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2282s) of the house or, you know, at some points, it's their outfits. Like, they don't really have anything else. Like you said before, you didn't notice it as an evangelical Christian sort of religious group. It was more about...

### **Matthew**

All, yeah, yeah, at all.

### **Cassie Davies**

There you go.

### **Matthew**

And actually, I should mention, like with the alcohol, my boss, my original boss there, he'd always try to push alcohol on me. I'd, you know, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2313s) something well at work and, "Oh, here, take a bottle of whiskey home. Have this, and take a bottle of whatever you want, take this." And he'd often ask me, I'd come into work on a Monday and we'd be chatting, and he'd say, "How was your weekend, Matt?" "Yeah, good, a good weekend." "What did you get up to?" You know, "I've done a few things with the family." "Oh, did you get on the white powder? Did you have any drugs?" I don't take drugs, I never have taken drugs.

### **Ben Woodbury**

But he would, they really judge people.

### **Matthew**

Yeah, super unprofessional. I don't know why he would ask that. Why, I presume maybe because I have some tattoos or I don't know. But that was, and it wasn't only just said to me, this particular thing has been said to several other people within the business from the same person. And he would ask, "Did you get on the white powder?" or, you know, "some drugs, did you take something on the weekend?" "No, I didn't. I still drink."

### **Ben Woodbury**

I didn't even... maybe he wanted some.

### **Matthew**

[Maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2373s), maybe.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2374s)

But also, they have this worldview that if you're not in the Brethren, this is standard for how you live your life. So they have this view that if you're outside of the Brethren, you must be doing all this crap to survive. Like, this is how you live your life.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2394s)

Yeah, that's their narrative. And they kind of, you know, they need supporting evidence. "He's got tats, drugs, hand in hand, smokes." You know, like if you...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2406s)

Leave, also, that's the narrative they give you. You end up on drugs and you end up on blah, blah, blah. And sorry, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've never had a drug in my life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2415s)

I've never touched that shit. The thing is, they have this drug problem inside there. I mean, that's a whole other podcast on its own that eventually will come out. It will come out. The drug problems that they have inside there is just insanity. Some of the insider stories that we get is just...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2435s)

Alcohol is a drug.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2436s)

Oh no, it's more than alcohol.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2438s)

We're talking like... I actually said that to my manager at the time. I said, "Look, I've never taken drugs in my life with the exception of alcohol and cigarettes." I used to be a smoker, actually, when I started there, and that was extremely frowned upon. And I said, "You take drugs. You drink every week and every night." And he just, "Alcohol is okay." And just sort of just played it off as if it was not a drug and nothing to worry about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2469s)

Yeah, they do more than alcohol in there. Yeah, they do much more than alcohol in there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2475s)

But I think what this really highlights is the narrative that the Brethren have of the wider world, of ex-leavers or people, you know, that might be of different color skin. They're all in the same, you know, Sri Lankan, Indian, whatever, they're all in the same basket. Gays, the people that have tats. It's a narrative, right, that's set out in your brain. And even us as leavers, I can remember leaving and seeing somebody with tats, I'm covered in them now, but I'd be terrified because of the narrative.

And you used to have things [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2505s) my parents or my dad used to always say to me, "You're going to end up in the gutter pushing up drugs. You're not going to... you're going to end up in a â€¦" Well, and they don't. And today, like recently, I met up with a relative that left, and he was like, what they were saying in there is that you're being paid by a very wealthy 'out' person for every person you help leave. That's why you look like you're doing well. Far be the thought that I [am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2535s) where I am on my own merit\!

You know, it can't, it doesn't work in their narrative because you can't succeed out there. You're taught all your life, you'll never succeed. And so for them, money equates to success. So for anybody to be doing well, no, it can't be on your own merit. And that's where that whole narrative comes from. That's why they were probably asking you about whether you took drugs. Because you had tats, like, "Oh, you're an outsider, you're worldly, so you do drugs."

### **Matthew**

That's what I presume. And one of the other gentlemen that was asked the same thing, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2565s) he's covered in tattoos too. So there you go. More so than myself, he's covered.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah. But we know as ex-members, that's what you thought in there. I thought people with tats smoked or did drugs or were part of a gang.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2582s)

Definitely part of a gang, definitely.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2585s)

You just triggered on the racism thing that was asked earlier. I do just, I think not last week, the week before, I'd asked this older gentleman again, I can't remember what made me ask the question. Oh yeah, anyway, about interracial marriage. He said, I can't remember how it came up. I didn't ask, it came up in some way. And he said, "We do not believe in that." And I said, "What do you [mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2615s)?" And he said, "We don't believe in blacks marrying whites." I said, "That's disgusting." I said, "You guys have a presence in Jamaica, I believe, also." I think Jamaica and somewhere else. He said, "Yeah, we do, but we don't believe in, or we don't condone," or whatever the wording was he used, I can't exactly remember.

### **Ben Woodbury**

And you know why, Matthew? I've done a bit of investigation as to why, because I get asked this on my TikTok all the time, like, why don't they have interracial... why is it such a predominantly white community? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2646s) I found, I've asked a lot of ex-members that have left, and older people, that one of the "great men" said, "It isn't comely." And looking it up, looking up the reference to that, found it where it says that, and what it means is, "it's not pleasant to look at." I'm like, the whole, like you unpack that, there's a whole generation now of people believing this in a modern 21st century where it's not even thought of. And you've got people saying it's not pleasant to look at.

It's infuriating because you've got these people that are the first to cry out, you know, religious discrimination when you question their prehistoric, medieval beliefs. And yet, they're the first to tell you why we don't have black and white marriage, why gays aren't allowed, you know, why we chemically castrate people that think about wanking. You know, they're the first, why women don't work, why women aren't educated, why men aren't... you know, they're the first to lay down these rules, yet the first to squeal. It's unbelievable.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

How do the people in the black Brethren communities feel about that? I guess it's a tiny... I know only two or three families.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Girls, like what are you... there's not very many.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

There's very, very few.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2728s)

And I just wonder, I mean, I feel devastated that that comment from your boss, that they don't employ Indians. There are Brethren that are Indians. There are Brethren, right? Like there was a Brethren that moved, that was put out...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2744s)

Yeah, Cassie, he is so uneducated, that guy, and so ignorant, he wouldn't even know that. That was where they're from. They don't step outside of their country. They're not allowed to travel overseas without permission, let alone know where India is. He probably doesn't even, he probably went to year 10, do you know what I mean?

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2760s)

But how would they feel about that? I mean, hearing that is just devastating.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

How they were treated all their lives, like, I know, yeah. They were treated terribly, and then they had to move out.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2773s)

They had to all abandon India. Yeah, it was terrible.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2777s)

But on the same token, I remember a local priest, he was my priest, we saw someone, like, there was a couple that was, you know, she was slightly colored and he was white, and they're both South African, now married. And his comment was that, "Oh well, you know, they've got trouble because they didn't follow the rules." Like suggesting that because they got married, an interracial marriage, is why they've got problems. And he said [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2807s) right to me. And I was just like, and I was on the cusp of leaving, so I was like, "Oh, this is, if I need it, that's my seventh reason," you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2821s)

Crazy. So, I mean, I guess you were saying earlier that you weren't really around the young women. And I just wanted to know if they had ever talked about wanting to get married or if they want to do anything else with their life, or if there were dreams that they couldn't get to, or if they had talked to any of the other female non-community members.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2838s)

I believe they talked to another one of my colleagues, and he'd asked them, you know, "What are you going to do? Are you going to stay here? Or what would you like to do with your life?" And her response was, or one of their responses was, "I know once I get married, I'm not allowed to work. Once I'm married, I'm going to stay home and have kids and whatever. I won't be working."

### **Ben Woodbury**

And that, like, as a father, it's disgusting.

### **Cassie Davies**

Were there any, like, did you notice any people, like young rebellious kids wanting to leave? Like, I talked to the people that I used to work with that were non-Brethren, and they're like, "We always knew you wanted to leave. You were always so inquisitive about the outside world." Did you notice that?

### **Matthew**

None of the guys that worked with me, no. Not at all.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2895s)

And were interactions with the women very discouraged? Like, was there a clear sort of separation from having much to do with the women?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2910s)

The Brethren girls, yes. They were basically just kept in the office. They didn't really have too much to do with anybody else outside.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2922s)

What about the eating and separation thing? Did they drink with you guys? Did they eat with you guys? You talked about a Christmas party, how did that go?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2930s)

I will say on that, they're very good in that regard. We would eat. The business would do lunch for us on Fridays, and they would eat with us.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

They'd eat with you?

### **Matthew**

Absolutely, yeah.

### **Ben Woodbury**

You've got to understand the family name and the family dynamic behind all of that. They could get away with that. And probably because they're Sydney-based or Melbourne-based and they're higher up in the Brethren tiers, they could get away with that. There were Brethrens that threw like Christmas parties on yachts and boats for their works. And like my cousin, where he used to work, he used to send me a Christmas party photo, and then you got Brethren, non-Brethren on a Christmas party boat. Whereas, you know, I snuck into my colleague's house for lunch one day and got [caught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2977s) and nearly excommunicated over it. So yeah, it does depend on family names.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2985s)

And we should just reiterate that who Matthew worked with had a little bit of pull and hierarchy within the PBCC.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=2995s)

Yeah, so they would do lunch on a Friday and eat with us, some of them would. And then, yeah, like we'd have, early on, we would have team bonding sessions once every three months. They're stopped now, but they definitely would drink with us. They didn't worry about drinking with us, that was for sure.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3017s)

Yeah. Did you ever see breathalyzers hanging around? Would they ever use a breathalyzer?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3023s)

Absolutely, absolutely. Definitely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3032s)

I don't know what to say. It's just, it makes me just sad.

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, but like, Cassie, Cheryl, are you surprised by any of this?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3042s)

No, I'm not. It just, it hurts. It hurts. It's just sad. It's sad because it's another cookie-cutter workplace environment.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3048s)

Yeah, these stories aren't unfamiliar, you know, and that's the sad part.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3056s)

Yeah, and I think I feel sad that it's actually deteriorated so much since I was in there. Like, I've been gone 20 years nearly, and it certainly wasn't that bad. Like, the alcohol in workplaces was not as, yeah, I know that wasn't back then. And I feel like the deterioration around that is just tragic. It's just so bad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3084s)

Is that legal? Like, I know for where I am, you would have to have, you couldn't have, like, you'd have to have, I guess that's when you're selling it, though.

### **Matthew**

Is it legal? An RSA, like you'd still have to have a responsible...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3098s)

Not if they're all serving themselves, though. It's only if you're serving it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3103s)

Yeah, I guess if you're charging for it, you'd have to have a license.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3108s)

The illegal part is driving.

### **Ben Woodbury**

You know, and there's great work ethics, right? Yeah, but your comment, Cassie, about it deteriorating, I don't know, or is it we're just more aware now because everybody's telling the stories? Like, everybody's coming forward and sharing their stories.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3123s)

No, no, I think it's deteriorated because where I worked in a very Brethren business, it's actually now one of the most profitable, and we didn't have alcohol in the workplace.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3137s)

Oh no, yeah, I see what you mean, the alcohol. I thought you were talking about...

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3140s)

I'm just talking about the alcohol part. The other stuff was all there, very much so. I mean, I remember being admonished many times because, you know, we'd speak to one of the guys, one of the non-Brethren community fellas in the workshop. If we ever got, we'd be, you know, trying to have a small little bit of a conversation at the odd chance that we got, and you know, within seconds, within minutes, the boss would be right there, you know, "Haven't you got work to do?" or [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3173s) know, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3175s)

I do think it's depending on what family. Like, I left eight years ago, and I worked for five years prior to that for Lester Martin, and it was not like that. It was a workplace that should have been able to get away with a lot, and they did in terms of homophobia and sexism and ageism, but they never ever, like, I don't ever remember having a drink at work, probably because I was more too scared to. But there was never any alcohol. I think it's definitely the more bully, [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3205s) of bogan-type businesses. And you'll probably see that when you figure out who they are or whatever.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3213s)

Yeah. Let's talk about bullying. Did you see it? I mean, I know we've kind of touched on it here and there, but I just want to actually ask you right outright, did you witness any bullying?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3223s)

On some of the women that worked there, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3225s)

Yeah. Would you ever work for a PBCC company again?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3230s)

Absolutely not. No way.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Yeah. Has it left you with any sort of like triggering or trauma? I know you've only just recently quit, but a lot of people that have worked there before have said this to me, that for a while it's taken them a bit to not look over their shoulder or feel like Big Brother is watching.

### **Matthew**

No, because if everything was done their way, I guess I didn't have really any say in too much. So they didn't really, and if you just did it, they left you alone to do it. They weren't so much watching all the time. And I guess I'm hearing that more from women anyway, rather than men.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Okay, yeah.

### **Matthew**

The women that were there [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3285s) bullied, definitely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3286s)

Did you ever witness any illegal things happening, in terms of business? Like, say somebody illegally setting up fraud, like purchasing fraud or a buying fraud, or were you not in that...

### **Matthew**

Bragging about evading some sort of...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3305s)

We've had other people reveal stuff to us where they clearly were forging things. Did you ever come across, or any of your colleagues come across anything that was shady?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3321s)

Yeah, look, the business that I worked in bought us a bottle of alcohol every year for your birthday or work anniversary, depending on how many years you've been there. And one of the guys, he told me, because he didn't drink, so he asked the question of, so it's the women that work in the office, their job to get the gifts, the alcohol, the chocolates, or whatever. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3351s) he asked her, "Oh, could I just get a gift voucher or some money? Because I don't drink. So, you know, I'm allowed to have a bottle of whatever to the value of, I think it was $100. Could I just have the $100?" And she said, "I'll ask the owner, the boss." And she asked, and the response was, "No, because I can't claim cash on tax or money on tax, but the alcohol I can."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3379s)

Is that right? Okay, claiming an alcohol purchase on...

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3383s)

It's a gift. Yeah, it's a gift.

### **Ben Woodbury**

But that, it speaks volumes of the toxic environment of a work culture. You value the write-off more than you value the employee.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3395s)

The ten dollars you're getting back on tax over the correct, you know, over the work ethics of your colleague or your staff. Come on.

### **Ben Woodbury**

That's not unusual. I have worked in non-community businesses that do the same thing and will write it off.

### **Matthew**

But to tell the guy, so actually the response was, "No, because I can't write it off on tax." To tell him that and not give him the money is like, what's a hundred dollars to a business that's turning over, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3425s), a few million a month?

### **Ben Woodbury**

But also, he's getting back ten dollars. Like, if you're spending a hundred dollars, the GST you're claiming on that is ten dollars, and that's what you're fighting over. Come on.

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3441s)

I wonder if he'd asked for $90 instead.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3452s)

But that's all that I sort of saw. Like P\&L statements, anything financial is strictly Brethren. Nobody, I didn't know my cost for the production line that I run or nothing, which is crazy. I constantly complained that I don't know my cost, "How can I run this efficiently, blah, blah, blah," and was just, "Don't worry about it."

### **Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, nobody's involved in any of that. And that makes sense. In the work environments that I've experienced, it was the same thing. There was a non-Brethren, non-community member accountant, but I remember there were frustrations there as well in accessibility and things like that. So yeah, it's very...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3502s)

And did that make your job hard to do by not having that information?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3507s)

In any other business, it would, because I would have had to do reporting, and there would have been questions asked had I spent too much on something. But there were never any complaints, so it didn't really make the job too hard. Because there was nothing said about it, and if there was, I'd say, "Look, I don't know what my costs are," and it was just left alone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3533s)

Yeah. What would you say to those non-community members that are still struggling and suffering working for a PBCC business, that are tied into the money they make?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3547s)

Oh, you'd say that's... I don't know, just get out. I don't know because that's the hard thing, right? Especially nowadays, the cost of living is like, and that extra money helps. Yeah, I don't really know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3570s)

Would you say that you paid a price for getting that extra money? Did you suffer?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3578s)

Yeah, yeah. Just, it was just very frustrating. A less strong personality would suffer, I guess, and it would bother them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3595s)

Yeah. And you know, I don't come on here and bring people who've worked for PBCC businesses for nothing, right? This kind of stuff happens in workplaces all over the world. We have all this kind of stuff. The thing is, it's the sexual abuse stuff that happens, it's the racism, it's the homophobia. It is all those things that in a normal business, when that has been brought to it, it would be dealt with right away, and you wouldn't see it again.

Just like they had that [work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3625s) safety issue, and then it was dealt with, and then there were work safety things put in place. That's what needs to happen when it comes to all the other issues that are brought up in a PBCC business. And I bring people like you on because it is important. They have this facade and this face that they show the world, yet we have so many people that drop comments in our podcast, on our social media, that have had so much [trauma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3655s) by just working for them as non-community members. And it is sad. I've been talking to somebody else that's been working for a PBCC company who, it's just horrendous some of the things that you hear. So I don't do this to just, you know, say, "Oh yeah, well, everybody's workplace has this." I do this because these are people who are saying that they are highly compassionate Christian people who are running these very successful businesses. Well, they're very toxic [businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3686s). They're very toxic businesses.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3688s)

And I did make that comment to our human resources manager on my exit. I had a phone catch-up with him because I said to them, "Look, I'll have a few days to think about it, and then we'll catch up on the phone. I'm not coming back." And he said, "Well, I'd rather do a meeting here and have our ops manager, my boss, present." And I said, "Listen, he can be present on the phone. I'm not coming. Once I leave this business today, I will not return."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3716s)

Yeah.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3717s)

And he said, "Okay, no problem." And then he called me the day before, and he said, "I'm just making sure you're right for the meeting tomorrow morning." And I said, "Yep, I am." And then I had a discussion with him about the toxic culture. Now, he's a non-community member. And I said to him, I explained the culture and exactly how toxic it was. And I said, "I'd like my boss to be present tomorrow because I want to bring this stuff up, because [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3747s) involved in a lot of it, and he breeds this culture."

And I was told by the human resources manager, "Matt, I think you're taking the meeting tomorrow in a different direction. This is about your resignation, and I'd rather not hear about the other accusations." I said, "I have some examples from current staff members that I'd like to bring to the table tomorrow." He said, "No, I don't want to talk about that. If you want to address these issues, you can email me separately, and I'll have a look at your email."

### **Ben Woodbury**

[Wow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3777s). Because he knows that he, as a non-Brethren member, will then have to say something or do something about it, and he'll be held accountable. And he doesn't want to be held accountable in front of these people because he knows what the outcome is. There's no response, there's no outcome from it, right? There's like, what, the kid that took, the guy that took a photo up a girl's skirt, what, he's slapped on the wrist with a wet noodle?

### **Matthew**

I literally mentioned that to him because he's the human resources manager. I said to him, "You know, everybody knows about this [incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3807s)." And he didn't want a bar of it. He just said, "Send it to me in an email. The meeting tomorrow is not to discuss these issues, mate."

### [**Cassie Davies**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3815s)

Please put it in writing. Please put it in writing.

### **Ben Woodbury**

If he's going to forward it to them, he would never forward it to them. It means discussion, it means being held accountable, it means he has to do something about it, right?

### **Matthew**

So, yeah, but he's received it. Yeah, but who's holding that to account? You know, he's not audited. It's, that's where it...

### **Ben Woodbury**

If it needs people like yourself, Matt, to come forward and speak up like this for them to be held accountable, and I guess it's the purpose of Cheryl's podcast. That's, it's great. Thank you. Thank you, Cheryl. Thank you, Matt.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3848s)

I really appreciate you coming on, Matt. Was there anything else that you wanted to discuss?

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3853s)

I don't think so. If I have anything else, I can email you or something.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Sure, email us. We will do something about the email, though.

### **Matthew**

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3863s)

Since the recording of this podcast, Matthew sent a note regarding an important thing that was said amongst multiple PBCC members at work, with their wish that all ex-members never existed. He was shocked at these comments and what they implied.

Well, we really appreciate you coming on and sharing your experiences. I invite anybody who has worked for the PBCC to email us at info.getalife@proton.me, and [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3893s) will do just exactly what Matthew has done here. If you don't want to show your face or reveal names and business names, we're fine with that. I do think that this is also a movement that needs to be started up again. We had Christine back on the podcast, it was at the very beginning. I can't remember what podcast it was, but anyhow, we had Christine on way back at the beginning of our podcast, and we've had tons of people reach out and talk to us. So I think it's important that people like you, Matthew, come on and we hold these people accountable, especially for the alcoholic endeavors that they take on inside these businesses. So thank you so much.

### [**Matthew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3932s)

Thanks, man. Okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDawAryPDNo&t=3934s)

Until next time, everyone. Much love to you all. Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848â€“1882) â€“ Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882â€“1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903â€“1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953â€“1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970â€“1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987â€“2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002â€“present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** â€“ A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** â€“ The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** â€“ A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
