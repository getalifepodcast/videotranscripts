## Summary

Former school trustee Steve Simmons explains how a huge OneSchool Global money laundering operation could have put up to $100 million into Gareth and Charles Hales’ pockets.
We hear how PBCC leader Bruce Hales played a key role in the illegal operation that took charitably donated, tax receipted funds intended for the school.
The brethren now face an “Aberdeen” level crisis. Their “Man of God”is shown to be a morally bankrupt kleptomaniac. OneSchool Global, whose values claim to be “Integrity – uprightness, honesty and decorous conduct, governed by the Holy Bible” now appears to be a key player in a global crime syndicate.
With Bruce chronically and perhaps terminally ill, and his sons engaged in a deadly battle of succession, this crisis will plunge the already crumbling PBCC into chaos.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=53s)

Hi everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl and with me today is Richard Marsh and Steve Simmons from New Zealand. Welcome guys.

Today's podcast is a rather important one so I guess my message is to buckle up and we're going to just jump right in. Welcome Steve, thanks so much for coming on here and about to explode a very, very dramatic story. So I'm going to hand it over to you right away so we can dive right in. Just introduce yourself and let the listeners know where you're from and dive into what you're going to share with us.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=91s)

Good, well I'm Steve Simmons. I'm from Auckland, New Zealand. I was closely involved in what I regard as a pretty big scandal involving an office fit-out company called Unispace, which was apparently owned by Gareth Hales and Charles Hales, the sons of Bruce Hales, the leader of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC).

Most of the story relates to work done by Unispace for OneSchool Global, which is the schooling system in the [Plymouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=130s) Brethren Christian Church. That's got close to 10,000 students worldwide, I think, spread across something like 135 campuses. This story covers a period of about six years from 2014 to 2020, which is when Unispace was sold, and I think it's time it was all brought out into the light of day.

All the significant players in this story claim to be Christians, and not just any common Christians; [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=163s) claim to be the only true Christians. As such, you'd think it would be reasonable to expect that the word of God, the Bible, would, particularly the words of Jesus himself, guide them in everything they do.

One thing that Jesus said, I think it's in John 3 verse 20, Jesus said, "Everyone that does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, that his works may not be shown [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=193s) they are. But he that practices the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they've been wrought in God." So on that basis, I think the players in this story, I don't think they should have any issue at all with it being brought into the light to show that their works have indeed been wrought in God.

I was actually advised to get a lawyer to vet what I planned to say before I spoke about it publicly. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=223s) thought about that fairly hard because I know from first-hand experience that the brethren are very litigious and don't hesitate to take legal action to silence anyone I think might be about to reveal anything incriminating, especially if any of the Hales clan is involved. And as we well know, money is no object. They use the very best lawyers, not necessarily the most ethical and honest, but the most ruthless.

Then I thought, well, I'm only going to say what I believe is the truth, and if I do that, I think God will stand by me. So if Bruce Hales and the brethren want to take legal action against me for speaking about the truth, speaking about facts, [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=275s) that have happened, as far as I'm concerned, that'll be irrefutable proof that they've got no connection whatsoever with Christianity.

No doubt there'll be an attempt to spin the story as opposition to God and to the testimony or whatever. I believe the body of the brethren will come around once they know the facts. The brethren in this Auckland area where I live, they know my character. They know that I'm not seeking prominence or and I'm not vindictive. They know that I generally stand up for what's right. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=314s) as far as I'm concerned, let them try to bring legal action against me. They might find they're up against a God with truly unlimited power.

I'm happy to leave it to anyone watching this podcast to judge for themselves whether or not what's happened is in accord with Christian principles and whether or not the persons involved were acting like Christians should. I've been trying to get this all out into the light of day for the past 10 years, [since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=345s) it first came up. There was an attempt to scrub it up a few years back, but it turned out to be nothing more than a whitewash. Probably my persistence in trying to have it all looked into is a really good part of the reason why I was shut up four years ago and then excommunicated two years ago.

I believe everything I'm going to say is supported by evidence and witness and facts. I've got a lot of [evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=375s) and witness facts on record. And at the same time, if I say anything that's false or defame anyone unfairly, I'll gladly make a public retraction and an apology.

I guess it's worth doing a bit of an intro to the entities and the personalities involved because the story can get quite complicated. So the school and the trusts, the brethren schools, were started I think in the mid-90s. At first, they were basically just [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=409s) loose structure to support homeschooling. Gradually over the years, they became more and more like proper schools with buildings and full-time staff and so on.

I think there were 15 campuses in New Zealand and up until a few years ago, all the New Zealand campuses were operating under the name of Westmount School. I think they're all OneSchool Global now. There was a separate local trust for each campus and that usually had trustees from each of the cities or towns that were part of the campus. So each campus may have comprised three or four or even five [towns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=453s) or cities, and generally, I think there were trustees from each place on the local trust.

The Auckland campus had students from Papakura and Pukekohe, and our local trust was called the Hillsborough Education Trust because when it was first set up, it was based in a suburb called Hillsborough. I think we had about 11 trustees at the time I started the story. Some of the trustees on the Hillsborough Education Trust have been there since its inception, including my first cousin, Neville Simmons, and his brother-in-law, Greg Mason. As well as being founding trustees of the local trust, they were both on the national Westmount trust, which was like an umbrella over all the New Zealand campuses, and I think they may have been also trustees on the global trust too, but I'm not sure about that. If they weren't, they were certainly very closely involved in all the major decisions and the direction of the schooling worldwide.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=531s)

In 2005, seven members of the PBCC admitted to a one million dollar campaign to try and swing the New Zealand general election in favor of the right-wing National Party. They also hired private investigators to stalk Prime Minister Helen Clark. The plan backfired when it was exposed a few days before the ballot and tipped the election the other way. The press dubbed the guilty brethren members [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=561s) Secret Seven. They included Neville Simmons, Greg Mason, and Andrew Simmons.

Newspaper reports at the time also said that Neville and Andrew Simmons had a long-standing business relationship through their office furniture business, Aspect Interiors, with Bruce Hales and his Sydney office furniture business, and that Greg Mason's firm, Pump and Valve Specialties, also had a business relationship with Hales Brothers Pump Business in Sydney.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=595s)

The global headquarters of the brethren school was in Sydney, and Bruce Hales was the ultimate authority for everything relating to the brethren affairs, but of course, he had quite a team of people working under him. John Anderson was one of the most prominent. Some of Bruce's sons, I think especially Gareth Hales, were also very much involved in the whole brethren schooling system. It had been set [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=625s) by Bruce's father, John Hales, in the early 90s, and Bruce and John Anderson had been the main driving force in turning his vision into reality.

I became a trustee of the Hillsborough Education Trust around 2004 after one of the other trustees moved out of Auckland. I was technically responsible for the finance and IT, but I ended up being a bit of a [dog's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=655s) body, and I put in thousands of hours over the years, never charged a cent for it, as did many, many others.

So then a little bit of a background as to Unispace and the key personnel. Unispace was an office fit-out company headquartered in Sydney. I think it sort of grew out of the business that Bruce Hales had started back in the 80s called Archway House, and then a bunch of other office fit-out companies around the world were merged to make one big global organization called Unispace.

There was one in Auckland called Aspect Interiors, which was run by [Neville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=702s) Simmons and his brothers, Andrew and Jack, and that was one of the companies that became part of the Unispace group. So I don't know how the actual ownership structure went, but outwardly at least, it was just one big organization. If you looked on the Unispace website, it was, you know, the offices in New York and London and Paris and Auckland and Sydney, whatever.

As far as I know, when it was sold [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=732s) about 2020, as far as I know, it was sold as a global business. So obviously Gareth Hales and Charles Hales would have been the main shareholders and directors, but I'm fairly sure that Neville Simmons, and perhaps Andrew Simmons to a lesser extent, were fairly high up in the management of the whole thing. Either Neville or Andrew seemed to go over to Sydney pretty much every week.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=761s)

Just to clarify, are you saying that some of the school directors were also directors or part of the management of Unispace?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=772s)

Yes, that's clear. Yeah, that's definitely, yes. Okay. So yeah, I think it's quite likely that Bruce Hales himself had some financial interest in Unispace. Even if he didn't, I'm sure he would have been very closely involved with what was going on and would have given the boys a lot of advice, known closely what was happening all the time.

Unispace was, they were chasing large corporate customers like government departments and banks and so on, and they did a lot of multi-million dollar fit-outs. Seemed to be really going places. In Auckland, they rented offices near the top of a waterfront tower with a fantastic view over the harbor. You know, it was pretty swish. Good on them. I have no issue with any of that. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=831s) yeah, as you say, they were, you know, here we had Unispace directors and the guys at the top of the school, they were the same people, which is interesting.

So in Auckland, we built a brand new two-story classroom block. You can't, not a very good photo that, I'm sorry, it was just taken off the website, but it was quite a nice building, a two-story all solid concrete tilt panel and [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=861s). You can't see at the left of that image, there's a big hall as well, which was part of the same project. So we built this new block in 2009\. It opened, I think, cost about five million dollars.

Prior to that, the whole school had been cooped up in a small building on an adjacent property, which was very, very cramped. When the new block opened, it was for [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=891s) senior levels only, and the junior classes kept on using the old school, which dated back to around 2000 or whenever. You can see there, the blue is the new piece of land with the senior block and the hall on the right of the main block. But then in red, the red circle is what we used to have as the school, and those little buildings in the semi-circle or [quarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=921s) of a circle shape, that was housing all the years from, I don't know, year eight to 13 or thereabouts. So it was very cramped.

Anyway, so we'd all moved in and settled down into this new block. It was going right, and towards the end of 2013, Neville Simmons told our trust that all the schools worldwide were going to move away from the traditional classroom model. They'll start using this new self-directed learning model, in which students are given projects and study guides and so on. They have a little bit of time [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=963s) a classroom with teachers, but then they're left to sort of work at their own pace and in the manner that best suits their individual style.

So you might have some people who might prefer to sit with their feet up in a La-Z-Boy, or some might prefer to work at a desk on their own in a little cubicle, or some prefer to work in a group. You can kind of choose your style [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=993s) find a little place to do that. So the main practical component of this change was going to be that every campus in the world would have a large modern learning center with all these different workspaces and resources in one place.

Three campuses had been selected for the pilot learning centers. There were two in New South Wales, I believe, and Auckland. None of this is documented because Neville didn't want discussions about the project to go in the trust minutes for some reason. The trustees were in no doubt that this had come from Bruce Hales. You know, he was 100% behind it. It may have even initially come from him, I'm not sure as to that. And of course, it went without saying that the project would be done by Unispace. There was never any question about that. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1054s) obviously the conflict of interest, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1058s)

So just to go back a little, it would be very abnormal, wouldn't it, for, you know, in a normal school trust situation, for someone to request that a whole new project is put in place without anything being recorded in the trust notes and minutes of the meeting? Is that right?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1080s)

Yeah, and I think it's actually, it's probably almost bordering on illegal. I think trustees have an obligation to record, take minutes of everything that's discussed, everything that's arrived at. I think it'd probably be a legal requirement.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1109s)

Yeah, that was my understanding. The minutes of a trust meeting are actually a legal document. Yeah, the de facto legal document. So yeah, that's, sorry, carry on. That's interesting.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1125s)

Neville didn't provide any quote. There was never any quote provided to the trust for the job, but Neville, all he would say is that it was going to be a good deal. And finally, he mentioned a figure of about $300,000. Actually, my son-in-law heard him say, heard Neville say early on, just privately, not in a trust setting, at a private setting, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1156s) they were going to do the project at cost anyway.

But so if any of us, there were sort of several layers in the trust. There was the very top dogs, and then there was a sort of a middle layer of people who were with sort of titles and things like that who didn't actually do a lot of work, perhaps, but they were there to provide the trust with their [wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1186s) and so on. And then there were two or three of us that actually did stuff.

Anyway, if anyone, none of the trustees had any, if any of us had had any doubts about giving the job to Unispace without getting alternative quotes or without even knowing the price, we were just too scared to ask, I guess. Because raising any question about it would have looked as though we were going against Bruce Hales. So we just sort of acquiesced and [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1216s) along with it.

So the plan was to start demolition work as soon as the school finished for the year. This is 2013, and in New Zealand, the school year finishes early to mid-December. And then the idea was that the whole project would be largely completed by the time school started again early in February. So the trust immediately sort of consented to the project going ahead, and the demolition started just before Christmas.

Then there was a bit of a little break over Christmas, and then a couple of weeks later, early in 2014, Neville and his family went to live in the States for a couple of months. Just a day or two before Neville left, he emailed me the invoice, which was [$648,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1272s) plus GST, having told us the job was going to be around $300,000. And it was going to be paid in three stages. The first payment was due about the end of January, from my memory.

There was a note to phone him, so I did. This was a Saturday, I think, and he explained that he and his brothers, Andrew and Jack, they were also shareholders or whatever of Unispace, they would each make [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1306s) donation to the school of $100,000, which would bring the total price down to something like $350,000. And of course, he didn't put that in writing. He couldn't put it in writing. It just had to be a phone message, so I suppose so it could be denied if the shit hit the fan or whatever, or I couldn't afford it to any authorities.

I was a bit stunned, to say the least, but I sort of sat on it for a day or two, and then I told an older trustee. He was like the chairman, he was the [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1345s) father of the trust, or the grandfather, I guess. And he immediately hit the roof. He said, you know, as far as he was concerned, that's illegal, and it would expose the trust because the IRD in New Zealand was actually doing a bit of an investigation into various brethren entities and things at the time. And he thought it might expose us to scrutiny that we didn't need. So he asked me to call a special trust meeting.

Neville had left Auckland with his family in the meantime, so he wasn't present. I think the trust meeting was on the Monday, and I think Neville had left on Sunday. So all the trustees were, I said, you know, the facts of what had happened, and all the trustees were very, very concerned, mostly as to whether or not it was even legal, not so much whether it was fraudulent.

From my point [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1412s) view, one of the main worries was that the trust had actually very little cash in hand. The running costs of the school had been steadily climbing. We were still paying off our new building project, and earlier on, we used to have fun days pretty much every year, and some of them we raised like two million dollars. But they sort of started to fade away a bit, those really big fun days.

By this [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1442s), a lot of brethren were starting to sort of feel the pinch because there'd been the global recession about 2008-2009 in there, and it had sort of, a lot of brethren had to sort of retrench a little bit. And there wasn't the levels of money sloshing around that there had been earlier. So I was actually, well, I was concerned about the [legality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1472s) of it, of course, but my main concern was how we were going to even pay for it.

Anyway, the trustees decided to ask Michael Powell about it. He's a smart accountant from Hamilton, and he's very clued up about tax and charity law and so on. So he came up to another special trust meeting we had a couple of days later to speak about it. And he told us that in his view, it could be contravening tax law [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1502s) trust law, because the trust was actually legally required to act in the interest of the beneficiaries, which of course are the local brethren. And the trust hadn't even asked for any competitive quotes.

In the meantime, Greg Mason, that's Neville's brother-in-law, he's also a senior trustee and also a co-leader of the brethren assembly in Auckland along with Neville. Neville and Greg had [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1532s) a cozy relationship there as the sort of co-leaders, joint leaders of Auckland. Anyway, Greg had obviously got in touch with Neville and explained what was going on, and Neville must have filled him in on some of the inside story, no doubt as to what the Hales' reaction would have been.

Neville and Greg would have probably [known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1563s) what the Hales' reaction to it all was too. And so Greg's a pretty savvy politician, and he quickly changed from being one of the loudest voices protesting about it to strongly advocating for it to go ahead. Wow. So anyway, like talk about changing horses in midstream, it was just as slick as you could imagine. Yeah, he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1593s) going that way, and then he was going that way. But anyway.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1595s)

So just to kind of clarify for people who are not familiar with the brethren system, in each congregation, and I imagine the Auckland congregation would be what, quite large, what, several hundred? There were five or six hundred brethren at that time. So in each congregation, there's an informal one or two brothers who, in brethren terminology, take the lead, but they're like the spiritual leaders [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1625s) the congregation.

Those persons will be in direct touch with Bruce Hales about all the spiritual, and for that matter, financial matters of the congregation. And they would be the people who exercise spiritual authority within that congregation. They provide the connection to the global leadership, which is the Hales family. And so these people, Neville Simmons and Greg Mason, they had a finger in the Unispace pie. Or at least Neville did. Greg didn't. Neville did. Neville was a Unispace manager or director. He was also a school director, and he was also, you know, a de facto spiritual director, if you like, of the Auckland congregation. Is that the situation?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1679s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Obviously, unlike most churches around, the spiritual leaders, there's nothing official about it. They're not appointed, and if they step out of line, they can get demoted quite quickly, and somebody else will slide in. But the new person won't be appointed formally or anything else. It's just a totally informal thing, [isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1710s) it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1711s)

But they wield very considerable power over the congregation.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1716s)

Yeah, exactly that. Yes, the brethren would be aware that they are in touch with a man they regard as infallible, and therefore, you know, they do have a lot of power. So anyway, there must have been some bit of frantic activity going on behind the scenes because, you know, we hadn't got any [alternative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1746s) pricing, but Unispace was going to have to get the job, you know.

So anyway, somebody came up with a bright idea that we can just get a couple of other quotes from two other companies. It's not just any other companies. We didn't just sort of look on the internet or in the yellow pages and find a couple of other office fit-out companies to give us quotes. So there were a couple of other businesses in New South Wales, office fit-out companies, but they both had strong connections, links to Bruce Hales, to UBT, to OneSchool Global and so on. They were owned by the Brethren.

And one submitted a price, from memory, it was just slightly below the Unispace price, and the other was a bit more expensive, which was quite a coincidence. But neither of them had, they hadn't even come across to Auckland to visit the site or spoken to any of the trustees or anything, you know, it was just a...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1819s)

A box-ticking exercise.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1821s)

Oh, and then the trust got a letter from OneSchool Global, or from, I think from Mark McKenzie, who I think might be Bruce Hales' son-in-law, recommending that because Unispace had a branch in Auckland, they had the experience and expertise to do the job. They'd already started work on the project and so on and so on, and that we should use Unispace. So here was like a directive to the Auckland Trust from the main driving organisation in Sydney that Auckland should use Unispace to do the Learning Centre project.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1870s)

Extract from the minutes of the Hillsborough Education Trust meeting, March 2014\.

“Project 20 team leader, Mark McKenzie, has provided a peer review on our Learning Centre project, including costs, etc. He has confirmed that it is very comparative to the recently completed Darkes Forest project. Aspen Interiors has provided an alternative quotation for our Learning Centre project. GCM to forward peer review and quotes ASAP with recommendation trustees should review and acknowledge with urgency.”

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1914s)

See, so all of that is, it kind of meant that we were, you know, we were under pressure to just carry on, resume the project. The project had been stopped, and we were just basically put under pressure to resume it. So all the trustees, except for Maurice Clist, the older brother, and me, they all voted to just resume the project, tell Unispace to carry on.

Mainly because everyone knew that Bruce Hales was closely involved in the project. It came from him. He was sort of linked to [Unispace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=1962s), you know, and everyone knew that Bruce Hales was basically so close to the Lord Jesus that he could hear his heartbeat, so he couldn't be wrong, you know.

And then actually one of the trustees, a younger trustee, he just suddenly resigned at that time. He didn't say why. He just said that he, something like he had other commitments or whatever. I was fairly sure that he resigned because he just didn't want to get involved in this sort of shambles. And he confirmed that [later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2003s) on, like several years later, he confirmed that that was the reason why he'd got off the trust.

So they finally talked Maurice around after a bit, so I was the only holdout. Like I was holding up the project being resumed just because it just didn't smell right to me, the whole thing. In any case, the trust just literally, it didn't have the money to pay for it. So, which to me is a, you know, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2033s) one of the main points in righteousness, is that if you don't have the money to pay for a project, you don't do it.

So anyway, a lot of pressure was put on me, and of course, anyone that has never been pressured by having the Hales name dropped, it's a bit hard to describe, but the pressure is pretty intense. So anyway, in the end, I really had no option [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2063s) to agree to it being restarted. And I did that, but under protest. So they finally restarted the project around the same time as the students went back to school in early February.

And obviously, that was quite a lot of hassle because the workmen were working in the building while students were trying to learn, and it should have been ready for them by the start of the school year. A few weeks after the project had been restarted, an invoice arrived at the school from Chubb. They looked after the school's fire alarms and sprinklers and so on, and they used to do a regular inspection because it's like a school. They would come, I think, every three months or so and just check all the sprinklers and the fire alarm call points and all that sort of thing.

And their bill was usually, from memory, it was somewhere around two [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2125s) three hundred dollars per time. And then a bill came in from the same company for close to three thousand dollars. The office lady forwarded it to me to check. If it was an ordinary invoice, she'd just approve it and process it for payment, but she forwarded it to me to check. I thought, what's going on here?

So I looked into it a bit further and I realized that it was addressed to Charles Simmons, who's Neville's son, who also worked at [Unispace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2155s). And so I thought, ah, okay, this is a Unispace bill, not a Hillsborough Education Trust bill. And okay, so it's for the fire plan or something or other. And then I remember seeing in the invoice that Neville had sent me, there was a, like it was itemized a bit, and there was a line item for the fire plan for the new learning center.

So I thought, oh, I'll look that up and see what they charged us for it. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2187s) in the invoice from Unispace, the fire plan was just under nine thousand dollars, three times the cost price. And I thought, what the hell is going on here? Neville had assured the trust that the pricing was going to sort of, you know, be a good deal and whatever.

And I mean, I, as a trustee, I worked diligently, as diligently as I possibly could, to sort of keep bills as low as they could be. And you know, if I did any work for the [trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2230s), I either didn't charge them at all, like if I provided items, I either gave it to them for free or I charged it on at cost. You know, I just wasn't expecting these sort of margins. I was just, I was wild.

So then I thought, oh, I wonder how all these other items stack up on the Unispace invoice, things like carpet. Because there was an Auckland brother that supplied [carpet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2260s) of the kind that Unispace was putting down in the learning center. Not sure if they used him or not, but anyway, so I asked him, he actually happened to be a trustee as well. So I asked him how much carpet for this many square meters would cost.

From memory, it was something like 15 or 16 thousand, that's what he would have charged the school. And Unispace charged something like 51 thousand [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2290s) the carpet, same carpet. And it was the same with all the items, like the chairs. My brother-in-law, also in Auckland, he supplies office chairs. I don't know if they were using his chairs or not, but the chairs total bill for the chairs came to something like over a hundred thousand. And you know, there was something like, I don't know, there may have been 100 or 120 senior students, and there was over a hundred thousand dollars worth of chairs in this [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2320s) learning center, apparently.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2322s)

For myself, sitting here, and when I used to talk to my mom, man, she would be frantically baking all the time for this school. And I think the hard part for me to swallow in this whole ordeal up until this point is that how many wives and sisters and, like there's everything is always supposed to be going to support OneSchool Global.

And then here you have these people [literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2352s) marking things up three, four times a month that they're supposed to be, while everybody else in the community is frantically trying to come up with that money and not even know that they're trying to come up to this money for this kind of a project. It's just absolutely so hypocritical of the demands that they put on.

I just, like, I just remember talking to my mom and she was so stressed out. I mean, she loved to do her baking, but I mean, she had health issues and she'd be sometimes making 18, 19, 20 of these one loaves of bread that everybody liked just for money for OneSchool Global. Like this is just so, it's just not right. Not right at all. And it really makes me angry.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2395s)

Yeah, it made me angry too, believe me. And it's not like these guys were sort of, they weren't just ordinary middle-class people. These were all multi-millionaires already, you know. They were all very, very wealthy, very, very comfortable, lived in beautiful homes, drove beautiful vehicles, had, you know, had an office near the top of this waterfront building, whatever, you know. And [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2426s) as you say, yeah, brethren like slaving away, yeah, baking days and all that sort of stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2435s)

And that's what, anyway, right? That's what they use that Campus\&Co front for. It's funding OneSchool Global, it's funding OneSchool Global. Yet here we have a prime example of where all these hard-working, free labor of the sisters and the people are, I'm like, just completely devoted to this, having no clue where their money is being supplied to, where it's not even going to the school. It's going to [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2466s) outrageous project like this that, yeah, and I'm sure this isn't the only one example that we're just now witnessing and bringing forward. I'm sure this is happening everywhere in some, you know.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2479s)

It happened everywhere, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2480s)

It breaks my heart. It makes me just want to cry inside of just like, I just again, I just think of my mom and how bad her health was, but yet she would sit there from first thing in the morning all day long preparing all this stuff that it's just, I wish that I could just go and just drop off this information to all of them and be like, you're not really supplying your children and your grandchildren with this school, you're actually putting it into the [pockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2510s) of multi-millionaires.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2511s)

That's exactly it. Yeah, that's exactly right. You've expressed my feelings exactly. So anyway, there was a local brother in Auckland, and he was a quantity surveyor. That was, he was trained and qualified as a quantity surveyor, and I asked him to help me just work out the a realistic value for the whole job.

He came around, and we went around after hours and went through the work, [putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2542s) the ceiling in, the air conditioning, the carpet, the, you know, the wall linings, the furniture, and everything. We went through it line by line. And, of course, we could have got volunteer labour to do a lot of the demolition work at least. But Unispace did the whole lot, you know, and charged for it.

We worked out that we could have done the job to the same standard for about $120,000 if we'd used volunteer labor. Bear in mind that the invoice was $650,000, and we worked out that we could have done that job for about $120,000.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2583s)

Unbelievable.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2583s)

If we'd used volunteer labor. And then if we'd paid someone to manage the whole job, it might have come in at sort of $150-odd thousand. But if even if we hadn't used any volunteer labor, we probably could have done it for under $200,000, like perhaps $180,000 without volunteer labor. Obviously, this is, it's in New Zealand dollars I'm talking about. So which is, that probably equates to about $600,000 in Aussie and maybe Canadian [dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2613s), but somewhere around half that in greenbacks and pounds, I don't know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2619s)

Let's reiterate to the listeners, the bill from Unispace was over $650k.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2625s)

Right. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, there was that sort of rebate, if you like, which was a personal thing. It wasn't a Unispace thing. It was an implicit arrangement that Unispace Auckland's directors would make donations to the school, but we'll cover that in a minute.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2645s)

Yeah, we'll cover that after.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2646s)

So, and then somewhere along the way, I found out that the other two pilot projects in New South Wales, they'd cost about the same in Aussie dollars. So they're about $650-odd thousand Australian. And apparently, there hadn't been a murmur over there. I think it was actually in that note from Mark McKenzie, when he, to our trust, telling us to go ahead, he said that there was a project [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2678s) Darkes Forest that cost about the same.

So I was getting pretty wild by this stage. And so I talked to a couple of local brothers. Obviously, I couldn't talk to Greg or Neville. So the next sort of tier down in the leadership structure in Auckland, there was Peter Bishop, who has a very large construction company. Like construction is his, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2709s) in his blood. And he was the rising star in the Auckland leadership.

And then Brian Johnson is another one. He's a little bit older than me and lives quite close, but he's also responsible. He's got a successful business and very good at marketing and general business advice. A lot of people ask him for advice and so on. Anyway, they were both pretty [shocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2739s) by what I told them. And Brian suggested that I ask Neville for a face-to-face meeting to lay out my concerns, get him to explain what was going on.

Neville had just got back from the States a week or so before. This was somewhere in mid-March. So I phoned him just to ask if he'd agree to a meeting, and he just got really, really angry with me. He just, he said it's none of my business what margins Unispace makes, and he threatened to put a stop to the job. And finally, he just hung up on me.

Then over the next few days, there was obviously something was going on behind the scenes. I could sort of just sense it. I had this sense that [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2794s) that there was a, you know, a guillotine swinging over my head or something. David Heath, one of the trustees from Pukekohe, he was fairly high up globally as well. And he phoned me up and he sort of got stuck into me for interfering in the project. It still wasn't finished by the middle of March.

In early April, we used to have a trust meeting at the start of every month. And so in the April trust meeting, we used to have it first thing in the morning, like 6:30 or something. We had dealt with the usual business of the trust, and then Neville stood up and he started just absolutely [getting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2836s) stuck into me. He just absolutely shredded me. He was so livid, he could hardly even control himself, and he accused me of all sorts of things.

This is in front of a room full of, there were about 15, there were 11 trustees, but then there was the sort of management team and the CEOs and various others, and the secretary. There would have been at least 15 people in the room, I think. And he used Mr. Hales' name, and he was basically saying I was [opposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2870s) to Mr. Hales and to the position, to the local brethren, I've been disloyal to the trust.

And then he had a plane to catch. And so after saying his piece, he got up and left. And as soon as he'd gone, Greg Mason stood up and he carried on where Neville had left off. He obviously had been primed up beforehand, and both Greg and Neville, they can be absolutely brutal if they want to take somebody down. And they both really excelled themselves in their brutality that morning.

One point, Greg, he said, "Mr. Hales knows all about this, and he's very angry." I mean, all the trustees remember him saying that, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2919s) is important. I'll just refer to that a little bit later on. But none of this was actually, like it wasn't, I wasn't singled out for all of this. It was put out as being general and that all the trustees, but because everyone knew that it was all directed at me.

But all other trustees were just sitting there, and they're just [shaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2949s) in their seats, you know, because several of them told me later that they've never, ever witnessed a brutal takedown like that morning. It was obviously intended just to strike so much fear into every trustee that not one would ever dare to raise a question about it or anything with any connection with Bruce Hales ever, ever again.

I was just so shattered [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=2980s) that that I hardly ate for a week, literally. I just couldn't get food down. I didn't go out to any meetings for about a week. Up until that point, I regarded Bruce Hales as essentially a godly man, even though there was stuff that was, you know, I couldn't work out how it fitted into Christianity. But this man whose judgment I respected, he was very, very angry with me, you know, and it shook me right [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3010s) my foundations.

From that point on, I knew I hadn't really done anything wrong. All I'd done was I was trying to stand up for the brethren who I represented as a trustee. I was representing and acting on behalf of the community, you know, and here was this man who I respected, just very angry with me for doing that. You know, so [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3040s) that point on, I realized that he wasn't what he claimed to be, basically. I realized that he wasn't even a man of God at all.

I was pretty hacked off, of course, too, that not one other trustee, not even Maurice Clist, who, he would have been in his 70s by then, and he was a good, solid brother. He had mana. Mana in New Zealand is like, it's a word for [respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3073s) and gravitas or something. Maurice was a successful businessman, and he couldn't be pushed around, but he never stood up or said anything at the time.

Actually, to be fair to him, he was the only one. He came around, I think later that same day, he came around to my work, came [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3104s) to see me, and he just tried to comfort me and just reassure me. And he was the only one of the trustees that did that at the time. So I really did appreciate that, actually.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3116s)

Steve, we understand exactly what you're saying, but for people who've never been in the Plymouth Brethren, and people who maybe think they're like any other church, should perhaps kind of emphasize the terror and the fear that goes when the name of Bruce Hales is invoked. Because if you're deemed to be up against Bruce Hales, you're on the very [verge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3146s) of falling over the cliff, being shunned, withdrawn from, losing your family, losing everything.

It's a huge, this wasn't like a business criticism, this was a spiritual criticism of you and the other trustees. And in reality, criticising Bruce Hales would be deemed far more serious than even blasphemy inside the church. The belief in Bruce Hales, that he is the man [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3176s) God, that he's in direct communication with Christ, that he's infallible, is absolutely central to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

And so the thought that Bruce Hales is angry with you just strikes terror and dismay into the heart of any person who is a true believer in that system. And I can fully relate to your experience of being so shattered that you couldn't [eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3206s) or you could barely function, because we've all experienced that at the point where you know the guillotine comes down and you're deemed to be a traitor, not to God, but to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church leadership.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3222s)

That's exactly right. Yeah, the terror, it's indescribable. It's a deep, deep terror that, yeah, it really, really strikes into your heart. And I mean, it's trained into you from birth that the man of God is sacred.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3240s)

I mean, you know, as a child growing up, if I misbehaved, my mother wouldn't say, "Well, what would Jesus do?" My mother would say, "Well, what would Mr. Symington think of that?" Yeah. So this name was used like the name of God to bring you into compliance.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3264s)

Yep, that's exactly right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3267s)

And then you have, like, there's such good Christians inside there, right? You're talking about Maurice Clist, who here is your average, great, down-to-earth Christian who just gets overridden by the fear of Bruce Hales in him. And that's the part that just breaks your heart, right? When you know there's such good people in there that are just overridden by fear of the man of God, instead of being able to stand up and be [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3298s) humble Christian that they know that they are.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3300s)

Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's definitely true. Anyway, to get back to the story, the project was basically completed sort of early April or thereabouts, and we were supposed to have been making progress payments all along the way, but we hadn't. And we got to April, and of course, the trust didn't have any money. No money.

So what happens? Well, Maurice Clist and I, and we were the only two trustees that had held out against the project. None of the other trustees were in a position to loan money to the trust for paying bills or anything else, apparently. You know, Neville and Greg, they weren't going to be lending money to the trust. So Maurice Clist and I, we loaned the money interest-free to the [trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3361s) to pay for this learning center project done by Unispace at exorbitant margins.

And by the time we paid for the whole, settled the Unispace invoice, we'd probably between us put a loan of probably close to $500,000 to the trust, interest-free. And, you know, not one of the trustees that had been clamouring for the job to go ahead back in February, they weren't able to put any money in to pay for the project.

After the Learning Centre had been finally completed, I think it was sort of mid-April or thereabouts, we had an opening celebration in the Learning Centre. I think it was on a Monday night after the prayer meeting, and all the parents of the senior students were invited, and the trustees, and [anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3415s) involved with the school. And one or two guys even from Sydney came over that were involved in the global system.

I'm not sure who arranged it, but there was like, Chivas Regal alcohol, and you know, and there was top-shelf whiskey and stuff and all sorts of fancy food. Somebody had gone out and apparently they'd spent about four and a half thousand, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3445s) think, on food and drink for this evening. Wow.

And so everybody came, and the bigwigs talked about, you know, what a fantastic job Unispace had done with the Learning Centre, what a, you know, how brilliant it was, and great the design and so on. And it was, I mean, it was good, it was a nice environment. But they played a promotional video which they'd obviously got made to ensure that Unispace got the jobs at other [campuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3479s) around the world. The whole evening was just like a just a dirty big Unispace promotion.

A few days afterwards, the trust was asked to refund whoever had purchased the food and drink for the evening. I think it was four and a half thousand or something or other. The trust had to pay that, even though it was just like a blatant Unispace promo. And that was like a final kick in the teeth.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3508s)

And so is your impression that, you said this is a pilot project, do you get your impression this was kind of the show home for all their, for all the other campuses, so they could use that to promote, you know, basically repeating the scheme all around the globe?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3526s)

Yeah, yeah, it would have been a show home. There would have been that element to it. Also, it was just, they wanted to iron out any problems that might might have come up, I guess, and see what went wrong, see what went right, what needed improving and so on. And then I think these first three pilot projects, they probably would have been used for six months or so, or several months anyway, just to sort of let it settle down.

But yes, there would have been the element of, this is [Auckland's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3556s) thing, it costs $650,000, you know, this is Darkes Forest, it costs $650,000, whatever, you know, it's setting the scene for what was going to be charged.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3570s)

Yeah, setting the price elsewhere around the world.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3573s)

Yeah. A few months after the project was finished, we had a fundraising day at the school to help pay for it. And the Simmons boys, I don't know if it was one of them or all of them, I can't remember now, but they made a like a pledge, if you like, of a hundred thousand dollars. And of course, everybody thinks, you know, those boys are so generous.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3604s)

So this is publicly in front of the whole congregation? Yeah, yeah. Without saying they had actually taken it out of the school's pocket in the first place.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3622s)

Exactly. And they eventually donated the other $200,000. I think it was actually, I think it was about 18 months or even maybe two years afterwards that before the final amount was was donated, and we had to kind of harass them a bit to get it. And I think it was again, it was given at a fun day, so it looked as though it was, you know, them being generous.

And Maurice Clist and I, we didn't get our money back for the best part of two years. Not, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3652s) think we may have got a little bit of it back before then, but we didn't get a final payout for about two years. And then even then, it was only able to be repaid because the trust sold a block of land. I think probably both of us would have lost at least twenty thousand dollars in interest over that period by lending the money to the school, which was just financing a scam.

Yeah, nobody's, you know, and I don't, that's part of being a trustee, I guess, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3682s) know, you just do what you've got to do. I'm not moaning about that, but it's just that kind of, you know, it's one more, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3692s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, I was a school trustee in the Regina campus in Canada, of course, long before this, but yeah, if you're a trustee, you end up, you seem to end up paying a lot of the bills for some reason. So I understand the process.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3707s)

I hope everybody's sort of understanding we're actually still only about halfway through the story. Yeah, no, keep going. So about in, I think it was May or June, so not long after our learning center was finished, Bruce Hales went over to the UK, and there were a couple of big education strategy meetings, and he was present at them. But there were trustees from [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3737s) over the world that were there.

It was kind of intended to provide global direction and, you know, so everybody was working to the same end. And of course, the learning center directive or the direction or whatever you like to call it, was one of the main things that came up. So this is self-directed learning.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3759s)

I mean, if you go on OneSchool Global website and their recruitment advertisements, it's all over self-directed learning. It's their kind of hallmark.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3770s)

And of course, the learning center is the core of the self-directed learning. Yeah, that's the means to the end. So and anyway, at this meeting, Bruce Hales, he clearly, unequivocally stated that learning centers at every campus all over the world, they were to be done exclusively by Unispace. Oh, wow. No question. Unispace is owned by two of his sons. No conflict.

And so here he is, the leader of the church, ordering his followers worldwide to award his company, or his son's company, millions of dollars worth of projects at grossly inflated prices. And then he went back to the UK a couple of months after that again. I'm not sure why, but there was another big education meeting over there that time too. And one or two of the senior trustees from our campus were there.

I can't recall exactly who, I think David Heath from Pukekohe was one of them. But whoever it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3840s) gave our trust a bit of an overview of what had happened when they got back. And I clearly remember the trust being told about some brothers in the UK who had the utter temerity to get competitive prices from other companies other than Unispace for their learning centers.

Bear in mind that Unispace's prices were, you know, very high, and it would have been pretty easy to get prices cheaper. And probably a lot of these [trusts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3870s) were financially straitened, you know. And these brothers had sort of, they'd looked at the price given by Unispace for the learning center and they thought, you know, that seems pretty high, I'll just do what I should do and get a competitive price from someone else.

Anyway, this whoever it was, the senior trustee that was telling our trust about it, he said it had come up at Mr. Hales's second visit to the UK, and he said the brothers who did that could count themselves [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3900s) fortunate to be still in fellowship. 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3906s)

Wow\! So in other words, they were threatened with excommunication.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3911s)

Excommunication for being so wicked, so, what's the word, like so devoid of all moral principles and everything else as to, yeah, as to get another alternative price for a project for the community which they were serving. Not even fit for Christian fellowship. 

And, you know, I gather that they, no doubt, they went through the same feelings, if you like, as I had after my smiting. But, you know, they probably put their tail between their legs and slunk back into their little holes. And, you know, nothing immoral, nothing unrighteous, but they'd basically been almost, they've been dangled over the precipice of excommunication just for doing that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3963s)

To just really reiterate that, that here is someone who claims to be the man of God, right, direct conversations with God, the Lord, whoever he claims it to be, but yet is using his authority to make sure that his sons make this extra money. Like, let's just literally, I hope everybody that is inside there that is still listening to this at this point in time on this podcast, I want you to sit and [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=3994s) sit with that.

Man of God. I mean, from anything that I understand of Jesus's story, right, and I mean, I walk with big crutches with that, but my understanding would be that we're here to help people. We are here to make things easier. We are not here to make the most money possible. Money in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has replaced faith in Christianity, and this is the prime, [prime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4026s) example of where this has been replaced. So if you truly want to stay and be a Christian, I suggest that you exit out of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and find yourself a church that honors and gives credit to answering to God and Jesus, not to a man.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4047s)

Absolutely. Yep.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4049s)

Yep. Not wanting to have a reading here, but there's a scripture that speaks about, "by his poverty, we are enriched," speaking of Jesus. Well, in this case, you could say that in the case of Bruce Hales, by his enrichment, we were impoverished.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4067s)

Exactly. That is witnessed to, because I actually, I spoke to one or two of the other trustees later and reminded them of that, and they recalled it clearly. Is that in the meeting, in the minutes, sorry, of the meeting, I assume that there were minutes taken of both those meetings that Bruce Hales was at in the UK.

There would have been minutes taken, but what was that in the minutes, or was it never put in the minutes, or was it scrubbed from them afterwards? I've got no idea, but it could be that there'd be a lot of brethren in the UK that were at, or from all over the world, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4108s) were at those meetings that would have heard Bruce say that, firstly, that the jobs were to be done exclusively by Unispace. And secondly, the way that those brothers were so shredded for getting alternative pricing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4124s)

You think, like back when I was in there, right, like what happened to the practices of community coming together and getting a job done? Like it's just, to me, it just doesn't make sense that this would have, why would it, if it could have been done at a much, much lower price, why wouldn't have that happened?

To me, that's what they try and hold their whole foundation on, is that it's this community that's there to help and give compassion and care to everybody and everything. Back in the 90s when I was in there, like that would have [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4154s) a community that would have come together. It would have been built together. All that blood, sweat, and tears would have been put in by the community itself to come together and not only save costs but build that community feeling that they base themselves on.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4170s)

Yep, like a barn raising in the Amish community. Yeah, the whole community comes together and lo and behold, the barn goes up in a day or something or other. And yeah, about a year after all this had happened, a directive went out from Sydney that all the older trustees with experience and financial substance, they had to get off the school trusts and be replaced with younger trustees.

So it was a little bit baffling at first, but the reason for it became pretty clear to me that the older trustees with experience, they were going to get in the way of this sort of thing. So he wanted younger trustees on who would do his bidding, if you like.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4226s)

Yeah, more easily manipulated.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4228s)

Yeah. So all the older trustees on the Auckland Trust, except for Maurice Clist and me, they all resigned, including Neville and Greg. A couple of younger ones remained on, and then a couple of other younger ones were put on. Maurice and I were put under a huge amount of pressure to get off, but we both refused to resign.

I refused to resign because I was the finance trustee, and at that stage, I was paying all the staff wages, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4260s) was doing all the tax returns, the GST returns. You know, there was an enormous amount of work that I was still doing as the finance trustee, and there's no way that I could have just resigned. The place would have descended into chaos. No GST returns would have got presented, the staff wouldn't have got paid.

None of the new trustees knew anything about it. So I just said, look, I'll resign when this system's in [place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4290s) to make the school keep running. Maurice wouldn't resign because he still had money, I forget the reason, but I think it was partly because he still had money loaned to the school at that point.

But they were so desperate to get rid of us that Greg Mason even made a public announcement at a fundraising day that we'd both resigned. And he sort of thanked us both for our service and gave us gift baskets. We got called up to the stage and so on. And this [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4320s) like, we hadn't resigned, we had refused to resign, we weren't resigning, but they made a public announcement that we had resigned.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4327s)

They had your obituary and your funeral, but you're actually still there.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4333s)

Yeah, we were buried, sort of being buried alive. And we knocked on the coffin lid and said, "Hey, let me out, you know, I'm not dead yet." So it would seem anyway. So then three months after that, the next directive came out from Sydney. This time it was about the junior schools. Up until that time, there'd been, you know, J1, J2, or whatever they are, I don't know, year one, year two, year three, year four, in separate [classrooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4363s) with a teacher for each classroom.

Anyway, the new thinking was that if we had, similar to the learning center kind of thing, a big room, and teachers could share the responsibility and they could devote more time to children that needed additional help and so on, and that the brighter ones could work at their own pace and so on.

So anyway, so there was this plan that in our older block, which had four separate classrooms and [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4393s) hall, that the walls would get knocked out between the four classrooms and it would be made into a, you know, fancy like a junior learning center type arrangement, open plan school room. Open plan and yeah, and sort of bright colors and different sort of pods and different areas that kids could go to learn according to their style and so on.

And of course, no prizes for guessing who was [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4424s) to do the work. So the trustees of the Auckland campus, who now, there were probably about, may have been five, I think, probably younger ones plus me and Maurice, hardly any of them had much in the way of business experience. Some had no equity at all, like zero equity mortgages. They all had mortgages. They all obviously enthusiastically took this up. It was another pearl of wisdom from Bruce Hales himself.

And this time around, [Unispace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4454s) said they needed $35,000 or thereabouts just to provide the quote. What? Yeah. So this is, this is not, all you get for paying this $35,000 is a quote. Apparently, that was in line with the normal sort of corporate practice those days. So that got rammed through, and then money was paid to Unispace for the quote.

And the quote came back just under a million dollars to, you know, to take three walls out between four classrooms and pretty it up a little bit. And then there was some secondary work in the yard and so on to be done later on. And the total price was about $1.3 million. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4510s) whole, we built the whole junior school a few years before for somewhere around half a million thereabouts, I think, maybe $600,000, I don't know.

The quote came in just right at the end of October, a couple of days before the end of October, I think, with along with a message that they needed the go-ahead within about a week. They needed the trust to give them the go-ahead about a week later so that they could get everything in place ready to do the job again over the Christmas period, have it ready for the start of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4540s) next school year.

So you know, here's a quote, a million dollars in this the first stage, $1.3 million for the whole project. You need to reply within a week, you know, get it happening. And of course, you know, all the trustees, "Oh, just yeah, okay, well, we'll just better go. It came from Mr. Bruce, you know, we'll just go ahead with it."

Actually, even Maurice, he was [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4571s) of willing to go ahead with it, but I just said, "No way. I just will not agree." I said, "The trust has got absolutely no money to pay for that. No money. Who's going to, you know, who's going to underwrite this project? Who's going to put money up?" You know, even if we did have a fun day and raise the money, who's going to pay for it in the meantime? Because the younger trustees, "Oh, you know, if we build it, the brethren will, you know, step up and pay for it," and whatever, whatever.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4602s)

So I said, "Look, I cannot agree with this. But if you want to go ahead, I suggest that two or three of you trustees go around." In any, all the previous fun days that we'd had, there was about 90 percent of what we raised, or 85 percent of what we raised, came from about 15 householders. Like there was [most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4632s) of the brethren would give, 85 percent of the brethren would give about 15 percent of the total that was given, and the other 15 percent would give the 85 percent of the total. Follow?

Yeah. And so I said, "Okay, so there's about 15 brethren that, you know, that we could count on to basically to fund most of these projects. Why don't you go around, tell them what's in mind, tell them it's come from Mr. Hales, that Unispace is going to do the job, that's going to cost a million or $1.3 million all up, and see if anyone's prepared to give or lend money to underwrite it, you know, until there's been a [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4678s) day to pay for it or whatever."

So they did. They did that. Two or three of the trustees went around to the wealthy brethren, told them what was going on, and asked if there was any money available. And not one of them had any money to spare at the moment. You know, they were building a new building, or they were building a house, or they had a big tax bill, or whatever. You know, there's, "[Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4708s) to be able to help you know, but not really in a position to do anything at the moment, I'm sorry."

So they reported back, of course, and oops, well, yeah, there's no money. So that was a bit of a dilemma. So we went back to Unispace and said, "Look, sorry, but we just literally haven't got the money to do this project." And then one of the trustees called Peter McIntyre, he basically did all the [donkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4739s) work around the school, and he maintained the yard and all that, kept it all looking really, really nice. He was brilliant at caring for the property.

And over the Christmas period, he and a couple of others, they got stuck in, just pulled the walls out and painted it, put carpet down, and got some furniture and whatever. And we got an area that was basically in line with Mr. Hales's vision, which we've done ourselves with volunteer labor, and the total cost was [$35,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4770s).

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4773s)

I'm really, I'm really bad at math, Steve. What's the ratio of what it actually cost to what Unispace was going to charge?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4782s)

Well, it's about, they were going to charge about 30 times as much. But we paid Unispace $35,000 for a quote, and then we did the job for about the same price as we paid Unispace for the quote.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4800s)

But you never got a refund on the quote? No, of course not. So just, it would be funny if it didn't actually happen, wouldn't it?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4814s)

This is brethren's money. This is, as Cheryl was saying, this is, yeah, this is all the sisters doing baking. Anyway, I'm trying to keep myself from, you know, it's hard though because...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4829s)

We have family in there. We all have family in there, and for me, that's what makes it personal. That's what makes me emotional, is that my heart breaks for all those women in there that have no clue. They sincerely, like my mom, when I, this is back when I used to talk to her, she would have sincerely believed that all that money that she was, she was like, it was the highlight of her day was to be able to provide for the children going to school.

And I think that's what breaks my heart and makes [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4859s) so emotional about it, which I think every single one of us should get emotional about it, because that's where the change comes, is that it's just heart-wrenching. It's heart-wrenching to know that they are using their members to line their own pockets, and these members don't know.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4878s)

Couldn't agree more. Yeah. There's a lot more I could bring forward too. In my role as trustee, there was, towards the end, there was just so much waste, extravagant spending and so on, but I could go on for hours. But I'm just going to focus on this one thing at the moment.

But the other thing to remember, it wasn't only the actual campuses that Unispace [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4912s) fit-outs for. There were a lot of other brethren entities, like brethren-owned entities such as the UBT offices and the national school office, which was like, not a campus, it's where the whole New Zealand school system was run from. They had their own staff and so on.

But at the campuses, there was at least a [local](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4942s) trust which had to be persuaded or coerced or threatened or whatever to give the contract to Unispace. But in all of these other entities, the decision-makers at the top of UBT, for example, or UBT accountants or whatever, they're the same people as at the top of Unispace. Like they're all in the, it's all part of the same circle.

So if UBT decides they want a new fit-out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=4973s) they give the thing to Unispace, well, there's just nobody to say, "Well, hang on, you know, don't you think that price is a bit steep? We could get that a bit cheaper by doing this or whatever." You know, but the brethren, of course, are giving to UBT all the time through their computer rentals and phone rentals and whatever else there is. And then UBT is giving it to Unispace, and it's all just in the same big circle.

For the new, in New Zealand, the Westmount national office had a whole floor in Peter Bishop's big glass edifice in Auckland. And while the building was being built, Peter Bishop's team, they were partway through fitting out the level for the national school.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5022s)

The brethren, the brethren school, OneSchool Global in effect.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5026s)

Yeah, yeah, but the national, this is the national headquarters, if you like. It's the umbrella organization over all the actual campuses, right. And like, it was the fit-out that they were doing was just a standard commercial-grade fit-out, nothing wrong with it. Neville Simmons walked in one day unannounced and he just said, "Rip it all out. No, no, not having that. No, sorry, rip that out."

And there was nothing wrong with it, nothing [shoddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5056s) about it. It's just Unispace was going to have the, was going to do the fit-out. Not just an ordinary commercial-grade fit-out, it was going to be a Unispace fit-out, thank you. And the foreman, who was a brethren man, probably late 30s or about 40, I don't know, he was just spitting tacks because not only at the incredible waste of brethren's money but the arrogance of the way Neville just came [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5086s) and just said that, you know, "Pull that out."

Like this is just, I think this is shocking stuff. I think any reasonable-minded person should stop and think, well, you know, how does this equate with spirituality or Christianity or even just normal decency? As far as I'm concerned, it's not spirituality, it's just avarice. It's just shameless love of money, lust for power.

As we know, as Cheryl was just saying, that like, it's just a non-stop pulling at the heartstrings of the community all the time by the continual references to providing for the potential and, you know, the wisdom of John Hales in setting on this deliverance from the world and so on.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5133s)

They'll get the, they'll get the school children out on stage in little choirs singing songs, and they'll get children to stand up at the podium and ask everyone to give money. And everyone feels that the money they're giving is benefiting the children, of course. Well, actually, a vast, a very large proportion of it is siphoned directly off into the pockets of the brethren Christian church leadership.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5163s)

Wow, yeah. 

So my wife has blamed my son Braden many times that he influenced me away from believing in Bruce Hales's infallibility and the rightness of the brethren position. I mean, she's sort of blamed me for believing Braden and so on, but I've told her every time it was nothing to do with Braden. This massive fraud scheme back in, you know, starting in 2014 and carrying on for the next few years, it just made me realize that Bruce was, he's nothing but a con man.

He's intelligent, he's capable, he's smart, but he's morally, he's just bankrupt. I, you know, I've got no hesitation in saying that. I've got no evidence, I've seen no evidence that he's anything other than morally bankrupt. My life changed [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5224s) the time Neville and Greg gave me that verbal thrashing in the trust meeting.

Like for a year or two, I basically, I ignored them. I was just cold and aloof whenever they were there. If they ever spoke to me, I just, you know. And Greg kind of realized that he'd been pretty rough, and I actually like Greg. He can say sorry, and he did. He came and sort of made a bit of a half-baked apology to me. [Wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5255s) really an apology, but it was a sort of one.

But I could tell he was in a bit of a bind because I'm sure he actually felt bad about the way he'd spoken to me. But how could he apologize? You know, he had only been passing on what Bruce Hales had told him to pass on, you know, and his loyalty to Bruce came first and his conscience came second. So we're about two-thirds of the way through the story, so there's still more to come.

Yeah, keep going. So fast forward to early 2018\. One night after a meeting, Brian Johnson came up and told me that he and Peter Bishop had been told to look into the whole learning center Unispace matter and report back to Bruce Hales. And so that came as quite a big bombshell to me. I never expected it would ever, you know, long since sort of [given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5311s) up expecting it would ever get looked into.

So they asked me to write up a one-page report on it. I said, "Look, I doubt if I could fit it on a page," but I had a go and I got the most important details down. Came, ended up almost two pages, but it was only skimming over the main points. But I included in that report that I'd lost, completely lost my faith in Bruce Hales from that point on, even though I knew that it was a report [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5341s) to him, you know.

So I think Peter and Brian, they spent quite a while on it. They spoke to other trustees in Auckland and around the country and so on. Probably most of the campuses in New Zealand had got Unispace Learning Centres by then. And they also spoke to Neville, and Brian told me that he'd been very uncooperative and arrogant.

So there was a bit of a review, which I wasn't any part of. I don't know what went on, but the upshot of it was that Neville was thrown [under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5372s) the bus. He was the public fall guy for the whole thing. It was made to look as though it was all him, and he got taken off. He'd been on trusts all over the place, probably 20 different trusts, and he got taken off them all. He moved back from the front row to the third row. He suddenly got, and he went around with a bit of a sad face for a bit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5397s)

I wanted to stop here so I can explain to the viewers and listeners what that comment that you just said was. Because there's many people have talked about this on podcasts, TikToks, little short videos. Steve just mentioned that Neville was moved from the front row to the third row. So for anybody who doesn't understand that, in the meeting, when you go to meeting, when we go to church, all the men sit in the front row, in the first few rows.

And so you're placed on the first, [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5427s), third, fourth row according to your hierarchy. So when he's referenced to Neville going from the front row to the third row, it would have shown everybody in that locality how he was being demoted. So he is being put on timeout. It would have been a clear, clear stance that they would have made to everybody else in that city, town, wherever he was at, that this man is no longer regarded as front-row material and straight to Bruce Hales. He's being taken away [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5457s) that position, just so everybody understands that. We, many of us who are on TikTok, we get these questions, right? And so this is a prime, prime example of what happens when you get used as a scapegoat or get involved in something that eventually Bruce Hales needs somebody to make a point that this has been taken care of. It will happen within the front rows and in the rows of the brothers that are inside the meeting. Yeah, go ahead, sorry.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5494s)

Yeah, Neville, he made a bit of a public acknowledgement in Auckland a few months later. He didn't say anything at the time publicly. He just moved back and, you know, put on a bit of an undertaker's face and so on. And he finally made a public acknowledgement, but there was not a single mention or reference to scamming the brethren or anything. All he acknowledged was that he'd put his judgment against, over [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5524s) matters, up against Bruce's. He'd told some people his own opinion instead of Bruce Hales's opinion. So that was made to look as, publicly, that that was what it was.

Neville, he had to repay some money to the, like part of the resolution of this matter was that Neville repaid some of the campuses some of the money that had been ripped off. And Peter Bishop told me actually that Bruce Hales himself had suggested the amount that Neville should repay to the campuses. I think to Peter and Brian, he'd said, you know, "Do you think this much would be fair?" I don't know what the amount was.

But I gathered that they both sort of gulped a bit. They both thought it should have been like two or three times as much. And Peter just mumbled something like, you know, "Whatever you [suggest,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5574s) Mr. Hales." And so that was what he paid.

Neville's never apologised to me or to the brethren for what I believe is avaricious and despicable behavior. He's actually met with me three times, each time supposedly to sort of apologize to me, but each time all he did was explain his position. He never said sorry. Each time I said to him, "Do you realize that at that trust meeting, what you said destroyed my [faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5610s) in Bruce, destroyed actually destroyed my faith in the testimony?" You know, I said, "I couldn't eat for about a week. It like, it really hit me hard."

But even then, he could never, he just could not say, "I'm sorry, Steve." Wow. You know, he can't, Neville can't say, "I'm sorry." Greg can. After this came up, all the other trustees all of a sudden got brave, you know, and sort of, and they all came, and people were coming up to me after the meeting and calling [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5641s) to my home and, you know, in tears almost about the way that they hadn't supported me at the time and whatever, whatever, you know. They were all, you know, kind of ashamed, but I accepted their apologies.

But I found out a little while later that, I wondered why this matter had suddenly needed to be reviewed. Suddenly, I found out the reason why, and that was that, I think the reason why is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5671s) Michael Powell, that accountant in Hamilton that I referred to that came up and gave advice to the trust, he had apparently written to Bruce and they'd set out a whole lot of concerns that he'd had, including financial concerns, probably as to some of this sort of stuff.

Included, his own accountancy firm had been taken over by UBT and had become UBT accountants, but he still worked there at the time, I think. And he was aware of [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5701s) a bit of dodgy stuff going on in the various brethren entities. And so he'd written to Bruce, and I think he might have, I'm not sure, he may have said something in this letter that he felt that as an accountant, he had an obligation to go to the authorities over some of this stuff. You know, I may be wrong there.

So all of a sudden, of course, there was this threat that he'd go to the authorities and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5731s) it would all get looked into. And so there'd been a flurry of activity to try and, you know, make it look as though it had been cleaned up and so on. But in the meantime, Mike Powell had been given a legal document, like UBT or someone, I think it was UBT, engaged lawyers and they drew up a legal document for Mike to sign.

And he had to withdraw everything he had written in his [letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5761s) to Bruce, and he may have even had to deny it was true. And part of the document was that he would pledge to never breathe a word of it to, you know, he would be bound to confidentiality for the rest of his life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5774s)

And let's just reiterate that Mike, this Mike is an accountant with, he's inside the brethren. He's not what we would consider a worldly accountant. This is an accountant within the brethren.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5786s)

Yep. Yes. He just didn't feel that he could, he didn't feel that he could sign that. I may have this detail incorrect, but this is the gist of it. He was threatened with excommunication if he didn't sign it. He's a very social guy. He enjoys the social life, enjoys his family and his friends and so on. And he figured the price was just too high, and so he signed it.

But it had come right down to the wire. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5816s) brethren in Hamilton had actually come together on a Friday night in the main hall to excommunicate him. Like, this is how it's done in the Brethren. You have a meeting with the whole congregation present in the main hall, and the matter's brought forward that, you know, this person is guilty of this, that, and the other thing, and we can no longer walk in fellowship with this person.

So they'd come together specifically for the purpose of excommunicating Michael Powell for not signing this document. They waited for ages and ages, but the persons who were handling this matter, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5857s) were waiting for them to come, and they never turned up. And finally, a message came that Mike had submitted, and so the brethren went home, you know. And he had escaped the death penalty by, you know, he had come within a whisker of being dropped over the precipice, you know, for not signing this thing.

So he did sign it. So that, you know, he, and as far as I know, he's abided by what he said. You know, none of what I'm saying [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5887s), he hasn't gone against what he said he'd do, as far as I know. So he's gagged.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5892s)

Gagged for life on the subject, legally gagged.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5896s)

Anyway, yeah, he's gagged. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So then, so after my son Braden was withdrawn from in 2019, I was pretty unhappy about that whole, about Braden being withdrawn from. And I started raising my concerns about various things that Bruce was implicated in, including the whole Unispace saga, which in my mind, it was still outstanding. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5928s) obviously that all got relayed back to Bruce, and he desperately didn't want any of this stuff to come out into the light.

And Peter and Brian told me that he denied having anything to do with the learning centers or knowing anything about them. Like Peter told me, "Bruce says he had absolutely nothing to do with the learning centers. He left it to his boys." And I said, "But you know, he said this." And Peter said, "So what, are you calling Bruce Hales a liar?"

Well, it's not true. I don't know, I'm not saying he's a liar, but what he's saying is not true. But and of course, you know, that made Bruce very angry when I wouldn't accept his assurances that had nothing to do with it. Same with other, look, I raised several pretty damning matters, including the way that you'd been treated, Richard. That whole thing, I, you know, I raised that.

And they said, "Look, that, you know, [made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=5991s) inquiry of the brethren and where were you from?" I can read, yeah, okay. They'd made inquiries there and that you had been rightly, you know, there was no question that the withdrawal was totally justified and so on. So, you know, I was just shut down for all that.

But anyway, they obviously didn't want any of this to come out. So there were three brothers in Auckland that were serving me, if you like. There's Peter Bishop and Brian Johnston and [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6021s) older man called Robin Suckling. Initially, they started a bit gently. They were sort of trying to persuade me that everything was actually all right. There were reasons for it and explanations and whatever, but I just wouldn't accept what they were saying because it didn't line up with the facts.

Their attitude got increasingly threatening, and then about a week before I was shut up, I was called to a meeting in Peter Bishop's glass building that we saw before. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6054s) basically, they called me there and issued me with an ultimatum: either I accepted that Bruce had done nothing wrong, or I'd be shut up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6066s)

Wow.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6067s)

Yeah, so I didn't accept it, and so I got shut up. One of the things that I kept raising was the way that Greg Mason had said in that trust meeting, "Mr. Hales," he'd used Mr. Hales' name, he'd said, "Mr. Hales knows all about this, he's very angry." And you know, I said that proves that what Bruce says, that he didn't know anything about it, isn't the truth.

Anyway, so they got Greg along to try and resolve this in my mind, if you like. And he apologized. He took very, very low ground, like, you know, he was just, he was crawling on broken glass on his belly, basically. He couldn't get any lower. You know, his whole attitude and everything, you know, you just felt so smitten.

And [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6117s) claimed he had no recollection of ever saying it, no reason, no idea why he would have said it. I was just gobsmacked. Like in 2014, he was one of the top two or three leading brothers in the whole of New Zealand, and he was in Sydney all the time, spoke to Mr. Hales on the phone every week at least. And he would have been sort of late 40s, probably, maybe pushing towards 50, I don't know.

But he was like, he's a responsible brother with his own business and everything else. And [somehow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6147s) they're expecting me to believe that a mature, responsible man in the confidence of Bruce Hales, had a lot to do with Bruce Hales, that he'd stood there in this trust meeting, he'd just made up a story about Bruce Hales being very angry just because, whatever. And he'd yelled it out to me in front of a whole room full of other mature persons. He couldn't even explain why he said it or had no recollection of saying it or, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6175s)

Yeah, you know, the whole plan with that all was, right, it's like, you know, they just don't like, nothing can get pinned back on Bruce. So he's got his men on the front to be able to change the narrative whatever way they need to change it to keep him, you know, away from it all.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6193s)

Yeah, he's squeaky clean. Yep, other people have to take the fall all the time. Yeah, yeah. So obviously, I want to make it quite clear in all of this, I've got nothing, I've got no issue with schools being pleasant places for the kids. I have no problem with any of that. And I don't mind businesses making a good profit.

Someone can make a hundred million dollars ethically and righteously, well, good on them. I, you know, that doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm not against anyone making money. I'm not against [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6223s) schools being pleasant places. You know, what I am taking issue with here is the way that Bruce and other people in his sphere, they used his supposed infallibility and his authority over the brethren and the continual appeal to provide the best for the oncoming generation. They used that to enrich themselves.

Yeah, and as you've said, Cheryl, the brethren responded to these things. They rallied, provided the learning centers, they provided the money to build these learning centers and so on. And so much of the money has just gone, you know, gone back to these wealthy people.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6270s)

I mean, is it fair to say this is classic money laundering, whereby the money is given for a charity, and of course, that means the government's chipping in 30 percent? And in addition to that, the government in many countries is also heavily subsidizing the schools. So there's a whole contingent of government money going into OneSchool Global, and then Bruce Hales has got this kind of golden tap on the side which he opens wide.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6300s) so a lot of the money that goes into their charitable funds is actually coming straight out, laundered through, I mean, I call it a twin-tub washing machine. Like your OneSchool Global is the first tub, Unispace is the second tub, and then all the cash comes out squeaky clean straight into Bruce Hales's pocket.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6319s)

Okay, it's an interesting thought. Yeah, it's probably a three-tub because most of it initially goes into UBT and then into the school and then into Unispace, but anyway.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6336s)

Yeah, I mean, actually, we should mention there, because a lot of viewers may not know what UBT is. UBT is the financial wing of the church. It's owned by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and it manages all their finances and has fingers in, you know, all the brethren businesses as a consultant and a provider of IT equipment, computers, phones. It's a huge global business affiliated or owned by the church. Is that fair?

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Money laundering 101\. The type of money laundering used by OneSchool Global/Unispace is called TBML, Trade-Based Money Laundering. The Canadian government gives this definition: "Trade-Based Money Laundering is the process of disguising proceeds of crime and other illicit financial flows as legitimate trade transactions."

In the case of OneSchool Global/[Unispace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6401s), there are two reasons to disguise the origin of the funds. Firstly, the funds have been donated to a charity and therefore include approximately 30% tax refund from the government. Secondly, the donors believe that all their donations are used for children's education. To see how TBML works, we will take a starting figure of $80 million to be laundered from tax-exempt charitable donations into the pockets of the criminals.

The first step in any money laundering scheme is to divide up the sum into many smaller transactions, small enough to fly under the radar. OneSchool Global has about 135 campuses, so by splitting the 80 million between them, each campus only has to launder about $600,000. TBML doesn't work for commodities that have a known value, so it is no good selling each campus a school bus for $600,000. The tax inspector would smell a rat.

However, building projects are ideal for TBML. There is no way to know from the school trust accounts whether the price charged for a building or redevelopment project is sensible or not. The self-directed learning (SDL) project provided a perfect opportunity to launder a huge sum of money. Every campus would need a large and expensive redevelopment of indeterminate value. But TBML does not work with competitive bidding.

A genuine competition for the job would immediately expose the extra sum being laundered through. So Bruce Hales used his spiritual authority to enforce a Unispace monopoly on the SDL projects globally. This having been established, all Unispace had to do was calculate a sensible cost price for the job, add $600,000, and push it through. Anyone who objected was cut into the profits or threatened with excommunication.

Repeat the formula 135 times and voila\! $80 million has been laundered from tax-exempt charitable funds donated for children right into the pockets of the Unispace directors. Everything is invoiced, the books all balance, and if nobody squeals, they will get away with it. So who was committing a crime in all this?

The victims, the ordinary grassroots brethren, were inadvertently defrauding the government by claiming tax relief on donations that are not actually used for charitable purposes. OneSchool Global and its local trusts were defrauding the brethren by not getting competitive tenders, unknowingly assisting Unispace in perpetrating a massive financial fraud on both the Brethren and the government.

The Unispace directors and PBCC leadership cooked up the whole crooked scheme and were the ultimate benefactors, abusing their religious influence and godlike powers of excommunication [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6611s) both eliminate dissent and to stimulate extraordinary levels of giving from the Brethren. What are the red flags for this type of fraud? There are two very distinctive features of TBML that stand out in this case.

One, conflict of interest. Many of the school trustees were also Unispace directors or had family or business connections to Unispace directors. All the OneSchool Global management was under the direct controlling influence of Bruce Hales, whose sons owned Unispace.

 [Two.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6649s) A monopoly. TBML can't exist in the face of honest competition. The brazen imposition of a Unispace monopoly was proof that something fraudulent was proceeding.

Here is an illustration of the OneSchool Global/Unispace play. At the top left, you have the ordinary grassroots brethren, the 40,000 or so parents and grandparents who toil to feed the endless appetite of OneSchool Global. To the right of the brethren, you have the initiatives: UBT, Campus & Co, Streamline 3, Trove, Connect, Orbit, One Medifund, and so on and on, all of [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6693s) suck money and labour from the Brethren and feed it into OneSchool Global.

Brethren also donate money directly to OneSchool Global through local fun days, bake sales, legacies, etc. So there is a direct arrow from the Brethren to OneSchool Global as well as via the initiatives. Below the brethren, you have the government, who give an approximately 30% tax rebate and in many countries also directly subsidize the schools.

OneSchool Global and Unispace are the two washing machines, and together they comprise the laundry. The OneSchool Global machine sucks in charitable, tax-exempt funds from the brethren, passes them on to Unispace via grossly overpriced invoicing, and Unispace delivers the money to Gareth Hales and Charles Hales as an apparently legitimate commercial profit. Gareth, Charles, and Daddy Bruce are all smiling. I wonder why.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6760s)

Yeah, so I am thinking about the Auckland Unispace guys, that they're all very, very comfortable doesn't begin to describe the kind of lifestyles they live. It's exceedingly comfortable. But I was thinking, like, if it was me in their position, I'd be like, [I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6791s) be ashamed to have just ordinary brethren into my home, you know, knowing where the source of this money had come from. But anyway, that's up to them. That's just the way I am. I can't do that sort of thing.

Yeah, so that's sort of a bit of a summary of the, Unispace was sold, I think, in 2020 or thereabouts. And no doubt it was [sold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6822s) on the back of an additional lot of business that had come through this, you know, from the schooling system at high margins. Were the margins higher than they would be on most of their projects? I don't know.

But a few questions do come up. And one of the first questions is, how much money did Unispace get from the schools and other [entities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6852s) like UBT and so on around the world? What, how much would the total be? And obviously, no idea, but you could make sort of, take a bit of an estimate. There's a guy called Dave Mitchinson, I think he must have worked for Unispace, perhaps on a previous job, previous employment or something, I don't know.

But anyway, he said on his bio on LinkedIn that he coordinated [135](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6882s) Unispace projects at brethren campuses around the world. And if you took the average project value, again, who knows, it might be different value in New Zealand and Australia and UK, depending on the currency and various other things. I don't know.

But if we took a guess at like, the Auckland campus cost about 650k in New Zealand dollars, and I gather the two [pilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6912s) projects in Australia cost a similar amount in Australian dollars. So I think it's probably reasonable. In the UK, what was the value of the projects? Was it 650,000 pounds or was it like 300,000 pounds? Who knows.

But let's, I think for purposes of this exercise, if we used a figure of about 650,000 Australian dollars as an average for the [value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6942s) of the projects, well, you multiply that out by 135 projects, and it comes, that works out to about 100 million dollars worth around the world over that period from 2014 to 2020\. But some of the projects were a lot more expensive, and some of the projects, like the national office fit-out in Peter Bishop's building, that could have been, you know, quite expensive. I've got no idea.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=6973s) anyway, so it may have been a hundred million to 220 million, somewhere in that sort of broad range. So then the question comes as to how much profit do they make out of that? Well, again, it's, you know, you can't really say. Based on the costings I've done for the Auckland project, the direct costs would have been approximately 20% of the, like the material costs and so on would have been about 20% of the total invoice value.

So if you allowed [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7003s) five, you know, five or ten percent for overheads, labor, that still leaves a margin, a gross margin of 70 to 75 percent, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7015s)

That's coming from, again, I want to reiterate that that money is being taken from all of the free labor of anybody that could have donated, and it's lining these multi-millionaire pockets. Could you imagine if they had stepped out on the front lawn and explained it how it went out, right? Nobody would have signed up for it.

So they've got to present it in this narrative. Again, we see this time and time again. And you know, just on a side note here, when we're talking about OneSchool Global and the amount of teachers that have come forward, like absolutely incredible the amount of teachers that have stepped up to the plate. Obviously, none of them want to come, it's too hard for them to come on and explain what it is.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7067s) even Ben Woodbury has tons of teachers that reach out to him. The amount of stories that they come out with that goes on inside there, as much as I wish that these schools were supporting our next generation of children, they just simply aren't. And it's because of situations that Steve has explained here. This is the foundation that the school system stands on. So what goes on inside these schools, Monday to [Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7097s), every day, just simply doesn't give anybody a hope in hell inside here of getting what they need, because it's just such corrupt stuff that it starts with.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7109s)

Yeah. I mean, that's a huge irony here, isn't it? In that the whole OneSchool Global system was set up to preserve the children from the corruption and the wickedness of the world, and it's run by people that are corrupt and wicked and are actually using it as a laundry, as a money laundry. I mean, OneSchool Global isn't the victim in this story. OneSchool Global is complicit, hand in hand with Unispace to funnel [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7139s) from the ordinary grassroots brethren into the Hales administration. Is that fair?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7146s)

Oh, yes, in my opinion, 100%. Yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7150s)

If you took that, the low, like say if the margin was somewhere between 50, the gross margin somewhere between 50, could be as high as 70\. If you took the low end of that scale, 50 on a, say 100 million of of work done, that's mainly Unispace directors pocketed somewhere around 50 million. But if you took higher figures, if you took say a 75 percent gross margin on [sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7180s) of 120 million, well, you know, maybe the GP was as high as 90 million.

You know, somewhere in that region, between 50 and 100 million of profit has has gone to the directors of Unispace over a pretty short period of time, which is, you know, not too bad. You know, maybe some brethren think that's reasonable, but [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7211s) think it's extortion personally. And it's all, you like, it's money that the shepherd has fleeced from his own flock, which he claims to care so much about.

They're all already multi-millionaires. Kind of reminds me a little bit of that when Nathan was sent to King David, and he told him that parable about the rich man not taking from his own flock to provide a meal for that visitor. He took a lamb from the poor man. Yes, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7241s) David was, he was angry at the, you know, "What he's done is wrong," you know, and he should restore him fourfold or whatever it was, I can't remember. And Nathan said, "Well, you're the man."

What my point is in speaking out in this way is I want to say to these people, like Neville Simmons and Gareth Hales and whoever else, "You're the man." You know, David got right, he got convicted and he got right. Well, [let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7273s) see if you can.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7274s)

Yeah, well, fourfold would be pretty good. I think we'd go with fourfold.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7282s)

So yeah, another question that came up is why did the Simmons boys make a donation back instead of just reducing the price? Well, I've got a few theories about the reason for that which I'll put forward. I don't know the actual reason, but what I think is that the Unispace directors had, possibly with direction from Bruce Hales, I don't know, but they're determined that the learning centers should cost [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7313s) that much.

And so all three pilot projects were all similar, as far as I understand, in their price, but in the local currency. But they had to be consistent. Like there's no point in two projects in Australia being done for $650,000 and one in New Zealand being done for $350,000, because immediately questions would be raised. So they've got to set a precedent for future projects.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7343s) in any case, Neville knew that if he told our trust that the Learning Centre would be $650,000, there would, you know, there would have been open rebellion. He would never have got it through. So he knew that. So the only possible way for him to get it through the trust was to offer to do what he did and donate, you know, half the money back through their share of the profits.

So it's quite likely that Unispace still made a profit [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7373s) though $300,000 was given back. I imagine they still made a profit on it. And of course, from Neville and his brother's point of view, it was sort of like an investment in the future, if you like. They're, you know, if they can pull this project off, well, then there's going to be a whole lot more coming in over time. They'd then, you know, get well and truly repaid.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7398s)

The, when you talk about 135 campuses that Unispace did these projects on, that's all the campuses. I mean, there are only 135 campuses, more or less.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7411s)

Yeah, I don't know if every single campus in the world got, I, Hamilton, just a bit south of here, my brother-in-law was a trustee at the Hamilton campus. But at that campus, they had three of the trustees had their own office fit-out businesses, one in Thames, one in Tauranga, and one in Hamilton. They just quietly did some, you know, did a little bit of work. So as far as I know, they never got a [Unispace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7441s) learning center there. They just quietly did it themselves without making a fuss of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7448s)

But essentially, almost every campus globally got a Unispace Learning Centre. I was looking up online on some of the UK campuses, and one of them actually describes it as a Unispace Learning Centre.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7464s)

Yeah, I see.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7466s)

Yeah. Wow. So this was just one play, like you call it the Unispace play. Like these big investors talk about a financial play. The Unispace play probably netted between 50 and 100 million for the Unispace...

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7483s)

Well, that's what it looks like. Yeah. Coming back to the making the donations, because they're a charitable donation, they can get a third of it back. So...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7493s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7495s)

…which effectively means that the government, as you were pointing out before, Richard, the government is actually chipping in, the New Zealand taxpayers are chipping in, helping support the whole scheme.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7508s)

I think the government might be quite interested in this video, Steve. Certainly, and certainly in places like Canada and Australia where the government is also directly subsidizing the schools, they may also want to rethink their generosity. But I'm sure it can be widely distributed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7535s)

Oh, yeah, we have our means.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7538s)

Initially, I thought that there might have been a bit of a tax avoidance component in doing it that way. But if you look into it carefully, it works out fiscally neutral, so it doesn't seem as though there's any…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7554s)

That's in terms...of the Simmons giving back some of the money, right?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7557s)

It doesn't, it doesn't seem as though there's any, you know, it's not illegal. There's no avoidance in doing it that way. Yeah. Well, and of course, in Unispace's books, they would have shown an extra, you know, 100 million or whatever of sales with fantastic margins over that period of time when it was being prepared for sale. And so, and of course, when a business is sold, then all these things are taken [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7587s) account in working out the price you can sell it for, of the business.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7593s)

It sounds rather like what they call a pump and dump scheme, whereby you artificially inflate the value of a business and then sell it. And then the new owner suddenly mysteriously finds that all the customers disappeared because they had been paid off to use that business in the first place. Not suggesting that anything untoward has taken place, of course. It's what it appears to be like.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7622s)

Yeah. So the whole question comes up, you know, so even if Unispace did make, you know, tens of millions of dollars profit from the brethren, is that, did they do anything illegal? Well, you know, I don't know. I can't say that there was anything illegal. I don't know that there was.

A lot of pastors in the mega-churches in the States, for example, they persuade their congregations to give them, like [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7652s) of them are incredibly wealthy, aren't they? They live in unimaginable luxury, and they fly around in private jets and everything else. And that's probably not illegal. They like, you know, if the money is given, not coerced from them, well, that, you know, it's not illegal. But even if it's not illegal, in my mind, it's still despicable behavior for anyone who's claiming to represent Christ to the congregation to [act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7682s) in that way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7683s)

From your story, there was an awful lot of coercion happening in the interface.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7691s)

Yeah. Yeah. And another major difference between the brethren and these mega-church congregations, they can leave if they want to go to another church. Exactly. They don't have to be there. And if they leave, they're not going to be ostracized, condemned, sued, followed by private investigators, and generally, you know, having their lives just destroyed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7716s)

Right. It's how they did this. Do you really want to be associated with a mainstream Christian church that is doing this kind of stuff behind your back while everybody's slaving away, trying to think that all their baking goods and all their everything that they're doing is going to the school, when really it's not all going to the school, right?

You are literally giving these people like the luxury of life while the rest of you are the peasants, right? [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7746s) to me, anybody who has watched this whole podcast up until this point should be re-evaluating where they're sitting, right? This should give you a huge wake-up call and re-evaluating how you are perceiving your seat inside this mainstream Christian church.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7765s)

I hear, I have to agree. Yeah. It'd be interesting to know whether the people, the company that bought Unispace, whether they've been able to maintain the sales and the margins that they, but anyway. Yeah. So, yeah, to sum up, as far as I'm concerned, anyone in the brethren who watches this, particularly responsible people, if you get to see this, you know, if you think that the way Bruce Hales is acting and persons that are close to him, if you think that that's the way that you regard that Christ would act and, you know, or that a Christian should act, well, you know, I'm sorry for you because you've never experienced Christ the way that I have.

And that's pretty clear to me that Bruce is just, he's just a smart, ruthless, old, calculating, ordinary man. He's not a, he's not an infallible man of God. He's not, he's not anything special. But I just can't get over the way that, like, it seems so blindingly obvious to me that Bruce just loves money. And scripture is [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7849s) clear about the love of money. It's the root of all evil.

The way that lives have been destroyed, businesses destroyed, you know, why haven't the brethren rebelled before now? Why hasn't there been an uprising about it? Why can't anybody see it? A web has been woven around everybody to tie them all into this big empire and to the point where nobody can even leave if they want to.

So I'd just like [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7879s) make an appeal that, you know, to anybody that watches this, if you're in the brethren, the man that's at the head of all this, he's not the personification of Christ. He's just a very smart, ordinary man, businessman, you know. Yeah, he's a smart businessman. If you can make a stand, you need to make a stand. But it might cost you a lot to make a stand.

But you know, what I've proved anyway is that God can make it up. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7910s) can make it up many times over what the cost that you incur by making a stand, it can be made up to you. So you know, that's about all I've got to say about this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7926s)

I don't know, it's been fascinating, Steve, and I've been waiting for this because a couple of years ago, Damian Hastie had been doing a lot of calculations. He's very, very good at analyzing the big financial picture. They've been doing a lot of calculations about the global income of the whole brethren ecosystem, and more specifically in the UK, where all the companies have to file their accounts publicly. He'd got all the numbers for the Grace Trust, [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=7957s) OneSchool Global, for the businesses.

And what emerged from it is that the money that the brethren are taking ostensibly for education is many times larger than any possible cost of the education. The cost of educating a student is a very well-known number because all the governments have to do it. It costs X many thousand pounds to take a child from five to 18 and educate them. So we know they've got 9,500 students. We know what it should cost to educate students, and yet a multiple of that sum is pouring into Unispace, OneSchool Global, Campus\&Co, all these many entities.

And the question is, where's the surplus going? You know, it's like filling a bathtub with the taps full on, but it never fills up. And then you notice that the plug is dangling over the side. And in this [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8017s), OneSchool Global is the bathtub. All the initiatives and all the brethren's donations are pouring in, but the bathtub's never full because there's a hole in the bottom. And where does that money go? It goes to Bruce Hales and friends.

So that's my sort of basic economics lesson. So we knew there was a hole in the bathtub, but Steve, thank you, you've come forward and pointed out to us exactly where the plug hole is and where the money is going. And I think this is just the [tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8047s) of the iceberg. Yeah, I agree. I think this is one of the biggest ones.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8052s)

So I just want to recap to put things into perspective here. $80 million is equivalent to $1,450 from every PBCC member, $250,000 from each congregation, $8,421 from every OneSchool Global student. That is lining the pockets of millionaires.

And I do think it's super important when people like yourself, Steve, come forward and break the narrative, right? We've talked about this on podcast after podcast after podcast, is that those people who come forward and are brave enough to tell their story, they break the narrative in people's minds inside there, and then they're able to put the pieces together. Then all of a sudden, they find themselves with one foot in and one foot out, right?

And then they start collecting their database [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8103s) them and being able to see through things to make that exit. There are so many people in there in that position with one foot in and one foot out. And I would say right now is probably one of the most potent times for people to come forward with their stories. I don't care if you've been out since Aberdeen, I don't care if you just left, I don't care if you think that your story is not worth it.

Every single story resonates with [somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8133s) inside there. Every experience that you have had will resonate with somebody in there. And I've had a lot of conversations with people this last week, where again, they feel like, "Well, you know, I don't know if my story, if it's got enough in it." And I'm like, "It doesn't matter." You could sit there and talk, come on and tell a story that may seem very, very simple to you.

But somebody inside there is going to connect to your heart, they're going to connect to your spirit, and be able to relate to you in some way. And you [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8163s) that person that all of a sudden puts that sister or brother inside there with one foot in and one foot out. And that's where we need people. We need people that have one foot in and one foot out for them to be able to then give themselves their choice.

All of a sudden, they realize they have this choice that they didn't know that they had, that it's like, "Huh, you know what, I don't align with these beliefs. I don't align with this corruptness." And then they realize, "Let's try and find a way to get out." And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8193s) all of a sudden, families are all planning together of how do we get out of this? Because that's how I see it happening, and that's how we are viewing it happening right at this moment. I'd have to say, along with everybody who has been working on the front lines, this last week has probably been the busiest week since we started our podcast.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8215s)

Really?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8215s)

Everybody is waking up in there. People are waking up.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8220s)

I have to... An important thing in what you're saying, though, is if families can stay together. Because what happened in my case, for example, and it's happened in many other cases, I made a stand, but of course my wife and family, they've hitched their wagon to Bruce. And so it's ended up in a, you know, in a breakdown. And we don't want, we don't necessarily want that to happen.

But it's got to reach a point where, if there's a man in there that's a little bit, you know, one foot in, one foot out, say, but his wife wants to stay with the brethren. And I can understand, like, you know, so many have got relatives and children and grandchildren and whatever. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8269s) but they need something to say, "Look, you know, this has to be a total awakening within the brethren worldwide that they're following the man they're following is not what he claims to be."

And if there can be a like a complete awakening so that it doesn't result in the breakup of families and relationships and so on, [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8299s) can get delivered from it without, you know, without enduring the pain and sorrow of the breakup of everything. That's, from my point of view anyway, that's what I would be looking for.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8312s)

Yeah. We hope that that happens, right? I do know that there are a lot of people who are just starting to live their life how they want to while still being in there. And it's one way I've seen in a couple of situations where the wife was still very much devout to Bruce Hales, and then they've got these interests that have been taken away from them, yet the husband's seen through all this.

And then they just start engaging in these interests even though that they're forbidden. And then all of a sudden, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8342s) wife starts understanding and realizing what their life can look like outside of what this supposed mainstream Christian church is supposed to be. So there are a lot of people in there that are starting to just live their life the way that they want to live it. And it is a way to allow the rest of the family to come on board and see how life could be like.

I don't think that any of this is going to be, it's going to be messy, right? It is going to be messy as [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8373s) start finding ways that we can do this. And people don't want their families broken up, right? I mean, we've heard that from Alona, right? That many of the people, that's their biggest fear in there, is the breakup. And so that's where this whole doctrine of separation, they built this cult very, very well. They built it on this whole doctrine of separation because they know that that is the key that can keep everybody with them, even if they don't want to be in there.

[Right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8403s) I do believe, though, stories like yours, Steve, that come on and are exposed the way that they're exposed. People who are coming on from back in the 70s when they left, these all, these are so important of stories to be told because it allows every generation in there to see what is their, what can happen when they leave and what the world can be like out here, whether you're Christian, whether you're an atheist, whatever you are, wherever your faith stands. [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8433s) is a place out here for you that is comfortable, that is sacred, that has the heart and the compassion that we all yearn for as humans. We all yearn to connect this way and be solidly accepted by each other as we are. And out here, you will find that.

And so if people stay for, Steve is going to come back on and explain his story. So we are excited to dive into that next. Thank you so much, Steve, for coming on and walking us through this story. And I'm sure everybody's going to be interested in hearing your own personal story after they've watched this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8476s)

The Unispace story comes right up to date. Earlier this month, the British anti-corruption watchdog Good Law Project reported that Unispace had secured £679 million in Covid PPE orders from the UK government in single-source contracts made without competing bids being sought. Many of the goods were priced between four and five times higher than the average trade [price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8506s) at the time.

£679 million is equivalent to 1.4 billion New Zealand dollars. The Good Law Project article says,

"2nd February 2024, Michael Gove opened the door to biggest VIP Lane firm. Fervent prayers for the Conservative Party and a promise to follow up how Michael Gove's emails greased the wheels of Unispaces' £679 million [PPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8539s) deals with Russell Scott.

Unispace Global Limited took the largest slice of the VIP lane contracts handed out by the Tories for PPE during the pandemic, landing contracts worth £679 million at some of the highest rates. Details on how they were able to secure a place on the unlawful fast-track scheme have been hidden until now. Following a six-month freedom of information battle with the Cabinet [Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8573s), Good Law Project can reveal Michael Gove was lobbied by the firm in the weeks leading up to its first eye-watering PPE deal.

Unispace went on to bag contracts with a combined value of $679 million, the largest total of any company pushed through the VIP lane. And these seven contracts, issued between April and June 2020, were set at some of the highest prices per unit. Two Unispace contracts for gowns and gloves were agreed at 5.1 and 4.1 times the average [unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8615s) price paid during the pandemic for these items.”

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnkaDA2BZ8&t=8619s)

Thank you so much, Steve. Okay, let's, thank you. Yeah, catch up later. So much, yeah, thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
