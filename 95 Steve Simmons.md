## Summary

One week ago, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin had anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny murdered. Navalny had already been confined to a remote arctic prison and spent years in  detention, much of it in solitary confinement. His crime? He had exposed vast corruption across the Russian elite, describing Russia as ruled by "crooks and thieves” and pointed out the opulent lifestyles of senior officials, their vast holdings, and luxury property
Now meet Steve Simmons - or perhaps you have met Steve before – in his podcast that was released just two days before Alexi Navalny’s death. In that podcast, Steve exposed the PBCC leadership as crooks and thieves and pointed out the opulent lifestyles of senior officials their vast holdings and luxury property.
Steve has already spent much time in solitary confinement, deprived of his wife, family, house, and every friend in the brethren that he had ever known. He was shut up 4 years ago, then withdrawn from 2 years ago, both on 22nd February. This podcast marks the anniversary of those cruel and unjustifiable actions. The PBCC is currently trying to wrest from him his business and business premises. We will discover in this episode the devious, dishonest, and inhumane processes by which Steve is currently being destroyed.
The first page of the PBCC website proclaims the following message;
“We endeavor to live in the generous and caring spirit of Christ our savior. Welcome! The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is a Christian fellowship based on the Holy Bible as the Word of God. We invite you to learn more about our faith, our beliefs, values, and our way of life.”
So let us take that invitation, and learn a little more about the Exclusive Brethren -  by listening to Steve Simmons on Get-A-Life Podcast .

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are back again with Steve sharing his personal story today. Welcome, Steve. And alongside we have Abi today. Welcome, Abi. Thanks for joining us.

So if you have not watched the Unispace podcast, I recommend that you do. That's the podcast right before this, and today Steve is going to [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=84s) inside his personal story on how he was excommunicated and what led up to it. So I'm going to just jump right into this and hand it over to you Steve, and yeah, go ahead.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=95s)

Okay, thanks Cheryl. Well, my name is Steve Simmons. I'm from Auckland in New Zealand. I hate talking about myself, but I do think it's important that I share these experiences that I've been through, particularly in the last four years since I was shut up, but really going back further than that too.

To give a bit of background, I lived in Auckland all my [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=125s). I was born in April 1960, so I'm 63, nearly 64\. I got married in '82, 42 years ago. I've been in the PBCC all my life until I was shut up four years ago and then withdrawn from two years ago. They were both on the 22nd of February.

My father, Robert Simmons, was always fully committed to the brethren position whatever the man of [God's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=155s) current teachings were. He never questioned them, even if he didn't understand them. And he was never prominent like his older brother Harold was quite well known. Yeah, that's my dad and mum, obviously earlier in their married life. I'm not sure how old they were there.

My mother was always outwardly subject to my father, and she always supported him, but inwardly she was in a lot of soul [turmoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=185s) all through their marriage, and she carried strong judgments about many things that were taught and practiced by the brethren. Craig Hoyle actually goes over it in his book, *Excommunicated*, which I think is very well written. Craig's mother is my first cousin. So when he refers to his aunt or something, that's referring to my mother.

So I grew up accepting the current teaching as being right and believing that the elect vessel was so close to Jesus that he couldn't say or do anything wrong. Some of what went on in Mr. Symington's time didn't make any sense to me, perhaps less so in John Hales' time. I think he [generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=232s) acted according to scriptural principles, as far as I could see. But if there was anything that I couldn't reconcile with basic scriptural teaching, I guess I just assumed that it was me that wasn't spiritual enough to understand.

I realized quite early on I wasn't cut out to be prominent, wasn't really something I aspired after. I'm quite happy to stay in the background out of the limelight, and looking back, I'm quite thankful for that because there's a lot of scope. Anyone in the brethren who [aspires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=268s) after a bit of prominence or recognition, it's not that hard to get it.

Unfortunately, you don't have to actually be a truly humble or especially committed person to be a leader in the brethren. The main qualifications seem to be that if you're a male, you're very wealthy, you've got your own business, and you're unreservedly loyal to Bruce. That's pretty much what qualifications are. Because most of them are also [overweight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=298s), they've got a pretty wife and they love strong drink, you know, that seems to be true.

And obviously, it's good if you can, you know, if you know your Bible and you can trot out the ministry from past and present leaders and take the reading and whatever. That's all, you do need a bit of basic stuff like that. But I've sat through thousands of readings and preachings that are just completely empty and lifeless, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=329s) going over the terms, no real power, and I just feel so sorry for the brethren.

What I've seen since I've come out, I've listened to a lot of podcasts from preachers like Tim Keller in New York, and it's made me realize that there's so little real food in the meetings. Even Bruce's meetings, there's not really food in them. He betrays himself or allows it to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=359s) portrayed that he's the personification of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, but as far as I'm concerned, you can sit through a hundred of his meetings and never be really brought to know Christ as your savior.

And of course, in the brethren, you're indoctrinated from birth to believe that you've been sovereignly chosen to be born into the most favored, you know, most enlightened, special, marked-out people on earth. The only ones that hold the Lord's supper according to the [scriptures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=389s), and the ones the Lord comes to first on a Sunday morning, and so on. The only place where all the truth is held and the most accurate translation of the Bible.

But as far as I can see, it's not the truth. I haven't joined any other churches personally since I was shut up, but as I said, I've listened to hundreds of sermons, preachings. Some of these men have got such a remarkable understanding of the Bible, of divine persons and principles [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=419s) Christianity. As I said, the one I really loved listening to most is a guy called Tim Keller who died last year. He's on Spotify and YouTube, Gospel and Life. I just love his preachings.

But there's others too, like men like John Lennox and David Martin Lloyd-Jones, C.S. Lewis. Each of them has got their own very deep, profound knowledge [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=449s) God, and they're able to put out the gospel in their own unique way. And I can say that I've learned a lot more about the scriptures and the truth in the past four years than I did in the previous 60\.

I've also come across persons from all walks of life who put almost all of the brethren to shame with just with their simple faith and devotion, committal. One day, not long after I was shut up, there was an old man with a guitar down outside the grocery store near where I live. His name was Peresi. He looked like an old hobo. He's probably [pushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=499s) 70, I suppose, and he had this guitar case open with a few coins in it. I realized he was singing hymns, and so I thought I'll ask him how he came to know Jesus.

So I went and asked him, and his face just lit up, and he was beaming all over his face. He told me all about his story, about how he got converted in prison years ago. And then he told me all about his life since his conversion. He probably talked to me for half an hour, and Jesus obviously meant so much to him since this conversion that he devoted his entire life to bringing people to Christ. He spoke about his experiences to anyone and everyone, and he'd brought hundreds of people to know Jesus: crooks, gang members, drug addicts, prostitutes.

[He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=557s) often had no money, nowhere to sleep, but every time God provided for him, sometimes in unexpected ways. Once, he literally had no money to pay his rent. He had been renting a house, I think it was winter, kicked out because he couldn't pay the rent. And he was praying about it. While he was praying, there was a knock on the door, and a man was standing there, and he handed him a check for two [thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=587s) dollars. And he told Peresi that the Lord had told him to go to that house and give the man who opened the door two thousand dollars.

You know, apparently we're not in the day of miracles, but that to me is a like a miraculous story. And he was much better taught in the scriptures than I was, not that that's saying too much. But the thing that really struck me about talking to him was the way his face was just shining, the way as he spoke about Jesus. You know, you could just see it bubbling out of him: joy and peace and serenity and just total satisfaction. He [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=631s) he had nothing naturally, but he had everything in his heart.

This was only a few months after I was shut up, and I'm ashamed to say that I still had the sense that you have when you're in the brethren that you're a bit special. And so when I went up and spoke to him, I thought that I might have been able to give him a word of encouragement or whatever. Instead, it came home to me that he was the one that was special, and I was the one that needed [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=661s) words of encouragement. It was truly remarkable.

But anyway, as I thought about it quite a bit over the next few days and weeks, I thought, well, if the Lord Jesus came in person, came to Auckland, who would he stick out? You know, you'd think surely if you were in the brethren, you'd think, well surely if Jesus came to Auckland, he'd come to, he'd stay with one of the brethren, surely. You know, obviously, it wouldn't go without saying, but would he?

You know, he could stay with Peter Bishop or Brian Johnson or whoever. They've all got very comfortable homes in good areas of the city. They'd provide the very best of care for the Lord, obviously, give him the best food, drink, [drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=709s) him around in a nice limousine with security men and everything. And I thought, no, I don't think so. I have a suspicion that if Jesus came to Auckland, he wouldn't, he'd just completely bypass the brethren and go instead to some of the worst parts of the city where there's crime and sin and so on.

But people like Peresi there that are just totally devoted to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=739s) Saviour, to the Lord, with hardly a penny to their name maybe, no adoring followers, no reputation, nothing naturally attractive, but something that's just real. So I thought about when Mr. Darby, I think, when he first left the Church of England, I think one of the reasons was that he realised that if Paul had come, he wouldn't be able to preach in any churches in the UK because he wasn't ordained.

And I thought, well, this man, this Peresi, he's got a far greater love for [Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=777s) than I've found anywhere in the Brethren. But if you go by brethren teachings, I'd have to stay separate from him. I wouldn't be able to eat with him, couldn't take communion with him, but he's a genuine kind of man. So I thought there might be a wee bit of a parallel with that.

And then, you know, you take that character of man and then you contrast it with the character of the prominent men in the brethren, and you think, well, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=807s) know, they're not the same, are they? Inside, you have a person with enormous amounts of money and success and everything else, you know, there's just nothing, no comparison. And then going along with it, inside you have this repeated cruelty and callousness towards people that's driving hundreds or maybe thousands of people [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=837s) destitution and despair and even suicide, and husband and wives breaking up and driving a wedge between parents and children and grandchildren. And even on top of that, there's this criminal activity even, and gross immorality, yeah, covered up, and deceit and lying and fraud, bribery and corruption.

To go back to Peresi for just for a moment, he asked who I worshipped with, and of course, I'd recently been shut up. But at that time, I was still expecting that the whole corrupt system would be [exposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=879s) quite quickly and that I'd be reunited with my family and friends. So I just told him very briefly that I've been cut off for raising concerns about what I felt was corrupt dealings in the leadership of the group that I met with.

And he just looked at me and he said, "Never let any man come between you and Christ." Wow. And it came home to me like a shaft, you know, I realized that he hit the nail right on the head. The teaching in the brethren is pretty much focused on the need to come to Jesus through Paul, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=917s) it's been the main teaching pretty much for my entire life. But I believe that it's the main reason why the position has now got so far from true Christianity.

Countless millions of people around the world find Christ as their Savior and Lord without ever having heard of Bruce Hales. And does that mean that they're not real Christians? Of course not. Does it mean that their faith and their beliefs are flawed in some way? Of course it doesn't. [Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=948s) has to find Christ personally, directly, in their own soul experiences. And letting, if you let Bruce or any other man or woman come between you and Christ, it's going to interfere with you finding him as your perfect savior, able to meet every, you know, every single need and desire that you might ever have.

Just to quickly go back, I've got six children, three boys and three girls, now aged between 28 and almost 41\. The two [eldest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=978s) and the two youngest are still in the brethren, and the middle two are not. Some of you may know Linda, who started the Olive Leaf Network about a year ago. And my son Braden is the one that Bruce Hales was talking about in the meeting in Sutton, was it back in 2014 or the year he said he should take rat poison.

As far as I know at the moment, I've got 10 grandchildren, eight in the brethren. Lindy's got two. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1008s) kind of doubt that my wife or family would even let me know if any more came along. Two have been born at least since I was shut up who I've never seen. Obviously, I've only seen one or two photos of them which sort of came through a back route. One of them is...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1031s)

So are you classed as an opposer?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1032s)

Oh yeah, of course, yeah, definitely. Join the, one of the, one of the worst, yeah. Oh dear. One of them lives about two kilometers from my workplace, but you know. So about, well, three weeks ago, I suppose, I asked my wife if she'd send me some recent photos of the grandchildren, but she hadn't even replied, which I take as a refusal.

So it's been four years now since I've seen any of my brethren grandchildren or grandchildren, except my youngest son continued working for me for a few weeks after I was shut up and then disappeared from my life. So I just live in a little cottage which is over the back fence from our family home. I bought it about a year before I was shut up, actually, in view of providing for my mother-in-law.

[It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1092s) was an absolute dump when I got it. I seriously considered burning it down or just demolishing it, it was so bad. Yeah, so that's the house when I bought it, but the inside is actually much worse than the outside. It was just a scrap heap inside and out. So in the end, I decided to get it renovated, which started about the time I was shut up, took several months. I'd honestly never expected that I would live in it. Oh wow. Oh yeah. So that's it now. I mean, it's clean and tidy. It's only small.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1135s)

And this is right behind your family home, like where your family lives now?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1140s)

They don't live there. Okay. My wife doesn't live there either. About eight months after I was shut up, my wife asked me to move out of the family home, and this was about October 2020\. So I moved into this little cottage. I had a small amount of contact with Jackie while I was shut up before I was withdrawn from, but we've had almost no face-to-face contact since I was withdrawn from.

And a few months after I'd moved out, she decided that she couldn't live so close to me, it was over the back fence, so she moved into her mother's home. So it's been empty for the past two and a half years. We're trying to sell it now.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1193s)

Oh.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1194s)

That's the family home. It's quite big. We had six kids, and you know, we used to entertain a lot. Not a very good photo, sorry. But in the last year or two, the market over here has plummeted. It's worth about $800,000 less now than it was a couple of years ago.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1211s)

Oh, wow.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1216s)

Anyway, I've got a small manufacturing business with 10 or 11 staff. Braden works for me, but none of the other staff had any connection with the brethren. I can honestly say that having the business has been a lifesaver to me. It's given me a reason to get up in the morning, something to occupy my mind. I can scarcely think of anything, any greater cruelty than to take a man's business [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1247s) him after you cut him off from his wife, his children, his grandchildren, his social life, every single support and legitimate source of comfort.

But and then take his business as well. Imagine, I mean, some of these people have just no reason to get up in the morning, nothing to channel your energy, nothing to keep your mind productively occupied. The brethren have done it to many. It just makes a [mockery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1277s) of what the pledge in the Faith and Practice document says.

So the Faith and Practice document, I don't know whether many of the brethren inside even know that this document exists, but it's like a charter that was provided to the Charities Commission in the UK, and it effectively forms the basis of the brethren being [regarded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1307s) as a charity. Anyway, section 6 and sub-clause 7, it says,

"No action should be taken in any way to treat vindictively, maliciously or unfairly persons whether within or outside the community, including those who were within the community and who are leaving or have left the community."

"Every care should be taken to provide for and support the welfare and education of the children and [young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1337s) persons within the community. Where persons seek to leave the community, reasonable assistance should be afforded to them in terms of support and/or financial assistance relating to employment or other matters where they've been dependent on the community for that support."

"Reasonable steps should be also taken in these cases, consistent with and subject to any legal requirements applying to persons involved and the human rights of the persons involved, to allow the continuation of family relationships where a family member has left the [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1371s), including providing access to family members, in particular children." 

So this is in black and white. It was approved, it says in the document that it was approved by the man of God. So Bruce Hales obviously had to do with it, and this is what was provided to the authorities as, "this is the way that we act."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1401s)

Is that in New Zealand as well?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1404s)

Well, effectively, it's in the, it was done for the UK Charities Commission, but you know, we've always been taught that there's one standard in the fellowship, haven't we? You know, you couldn't say that that applies to the UK but it doesn't apply to New Zealand or Australia or wherever, could you? I mean, I don't think so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1424s)

That Faith and Practice document was for worldwide. It just came out of the UK Commission's report with what was on at that time. To me, that was applicable to every 55,000-plus members that are a part of the PBCC.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1440s)

I was just wondering if it had actually been presented formally to any of the other governments.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1448s)

No, I don't think so, no. And I think that as far as I know, no brethren outside the UK were even made aware of its existence. You'd think like an important document like that, which is effectively like a charter, you'd think that it should be made available. It should be printed, like in a white book or something, rather given to all the members worldwide and say, "This is how we should act."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1481s)

I think in the UK at the time, we had this book called, this little pamphlet called "Practicing Our Beliefs," and that sort of smoke-screened that document. So even most of the UK brethren didn't actually receive the Faith and Practice document.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1502s)

Really, I see.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1504s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1505s)

And I want to let all the viewers and listeners know, in every podcast that goes out, this whole document, the Faith and Practice document, is attached to the description of every podcast that we put out so that you can always have access to it. And I do, if you're inside, print it off. Print it off and have it just laying around. It should be in every household, exactly like Steve says, completely accessible so that you're familiarizing yourself with it and [knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1535s) what your rights are and the rights that those that leave the PBCC have. Yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1541s)

Yeah, it's pretty explicit. And you take cases like Richard, for example, there's no possible connection with what they claim and the way they treated Richard.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1555s)

And he's from the UK.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1557s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's just a farce. If Bruce suspects that someone, anyone, might be a little bit of a threat to his place or his power or his control, the machinery gets put into action to suppress that threat or eliminate it. And somehow the threat is portrayed as opposition to the testimony or to God's sovereignty or something or other, and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1587s) then the brethren are persuaded that it, you know, it's serious and it needs to be dealt with severely, which...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1594s)

Did they come after the business?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1597s)

That, that going, they're trying to, but yeah, I'll cover that in a little bit later on.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1606s)

Yeah, of course.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1607s)

But it's all right. And often what happens after you've been excommunicated is almost worse than the treatment before. You know, like so many cases, the wife's persuaded that she has to get a separation from this wicked person and engage the top lawyer of a King's Counsel if possible, and you know, go for two-thirds [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1637s) the joint asset. You know, whether or not she needs all that money to live comfortably for the rest of her life doesn't, it's not a consideration.

You know, children are turned against their father, or mother in some cases, and then quite often the businessman loses control of his business, sometimes through sort of shady means or even illegal means. And if they can find any basis for taking [legal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1667s) action against the person who's been excommunicated, they'll do that. After anyone that's been excommunicated makes the smallest misstep or anything, then stories get, they just go for the brethren community like wildfire that so-and-so is corrupt or mental or alcoholic or an addict or whatever. And you know, they totally lose their credibility [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1697s) their, some manage to hold on to their sanity, but you know, others, it's just more than they can take.

Which I find so heartbreaking. You know, good persons have been just driven into destitution and despair, you know, nothing left in life to live for almost. It's kind of happening to me right at the moment, except that I'm not being driven into despair. But it's obvious that Bruce is trying to crush me.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1733s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1733s)

And destroy my business and credibility and everything, do what he's done to so many others. Just like get them to the point of desperation where they do something foolish or immoral or whatever. I can't think of any reason why true Christians would ever engage private detectives to shadow people, to track their movements and hack into their computers and email accounts and phones and all that, do everything they can to find dirt on people they regard as a [threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1764s).

Even in some cases, if they can't find it, they make it up. False rumors around inside the brethren community, which then leaks out into the wider community. Now, someone in New South Wales that Bruce seemed to view as a bit of a threat to his authority, this is going back quite a few years now, 15, 16 years, I suppose, and he was withdrawn from on a false [charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1794s). The reason, apparently, that he was withdrawn from, it was never raised with him by any priest or elder. And yet they claim that he was withdrawn from for XYZ, but they never ever spoke to him about XYZ before withdrawing from him.

And then after he was withdrawn from, false reports were spread around which utterly, they just destroyed his life, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1824s) in his reputation, and his business was taken from him. And you know, it's just one of the most horrific miscarriages of judgment that I know of. It makes me just so angry.

And going back to my business again briefly, there's a prominent guy in Melbourne called Richard Garrett with his sons, Daniel and Bradley, who work for him. They've got a materials handling business called Sitecraft. We manufacture materials handling equipment, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1855s) they were our number one agent for about 10 years. They sold millions of dollars of our equipment, knew every detail about the machines and the customers and the marketing and so on.

Just before I was shut up, they bought about $20,000 worth of spare parts, and then they abruptly stopped selling our products. And then, lo and behold, about a year later, they started selling their own copy of our machines. They even copied some of some unique design features of our machines, one of which had even a registered design in Australia. And they didn't bother writing their own user handbooks or manuals or anything else. They just took ours, which they had copies of, of course. They just did a find and replace, put the name of their machine in instead of ours, and handed them out to their customers. We know that because [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1913s) than one of their customers sent us copies of their handbooks.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1917s)

That's disgusting.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1919s)

It's illegal, but it's just contemptible for brethren to act in that way.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1933s)

So in their mind, they're like, "Why not? Makes our job easier."

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1936s)

Yeah, well, exactly. Yeah. So I wrote to Richard, sent him an email, but and we, we actually engaged a lawyer to look into it. We didn't actually take it through, but there was a bit of communication between lawyers. But Richard's attitude, like this is a, he's probably around 60, I suppose, that region, and he's prominent in Melbourne, and he takes fellowship meetings and everything else.

But [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1967s) far as I'm concerned, his attitude was just pathetic and childish. He wouldn't even accept responsibility for them sending out word-for-word copies of our documents to the customers. He tried to claim it was unauthorized, and he didn't know anything about it and whatever, whatever. But like, it's his business, he should take responsibility. Anyway, that's just a bit of an aside.

I think it should be obvious to anyone, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=1997s) any thinking person, that there's many matters that Bruce is desperate to keep hidden, to keep in the dark. In my view, he's the same similar character to many of the notorious dictators in the world today with enormous wealth and power, no conscience. They'll happily destroy the lives of anyone they regard as a threat to their position and lifestyle and [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2027s).

Like, if Bruce was practicing the truth, why would you have to spend millions of dollars on lawsuits against people like Richard, for example, or Braden, or harmless old men like Peter Harrison in Palmerston North? He's died now, but he was relentlessly pursued by the UBT a couple of years ago. He had no money to defend himself, and of course, they had unlimited resources. So they just forced him into a corner, forced him to not, you know, tie him up so they can't say or do anything that they might, that might harm the brethren, not that he wanted to anyway.

But as far as I'm concerned, it's just inhumane. I think the brethren just have to give in the care meeting, I think they're just giving millions of dollars every year to a fighting fund which is used to suppress opposers or so-called opposers. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2084s) mean, some of us are viewed as opposers, but not opposed to Christian principles, you know, not opposed to the truth, opposed to what's wrong. But there's millions of dollars being paid into this fighting fund.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2102s)

And just recently, that fund was up. So that was, I'm trying to think of how many months ago that was, but yeah, we had gotten word from an insider that they had to give more to that fund. So it was really more than, yeah, so their allotted amount had been raised. I see, wow.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2121s)

There's more to fight these days.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2126s)

Yeah. As far as I'm concerned, a Christian should have nothing to fear from the truth coming into the light. Exactly. And John 3, should welcome it because it shows to mankind that his works have been wrought in God. It's what it says in John 3, I think verse 20 or 21\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2147s)

And I like, I've said this before to many people, right? This mess could be cleaned up very easily, and Bruce would actually get respect for it, right? If he just sat down and laid all the issues on the table and dealt with them one by one like a true Christian should, right? Or a pastor, right? They would sit down and be like, "Okay, so let's take it, let's look at this this case, let's look at this case, let's look at this case. Okay, so the police need to be called in here, we need to do this," and get all the allocated people involved to help these situations.

To me, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2180s) call would be restored as a mainstream Christian church, and Bruce would have a lot of respect. And it is like, we know he listens to all these, or his minions listen to them and then relay it. I mean, I just reiterate it again, that the more that he resists is the more that messier that this is going to get. So for those that fear the mess that's going to happen, Bruce is the one that is causing this mess to get messier and more chaotic because he keeps on resisting the change that needs to happen.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2210s)

Yeah, yeah, I can't agree more, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2213s)

I think he's fearful of accountability and responsibility for everything that's happened on his watch, though. I don't think he can take the comedown and the ego smash that he would have if he did.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2231s)

That, exactly, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2233s)

Yeah, but I mean, again, being a man of God and he's getting his direct word the way that he says he's getting it, to me, that should just be an automatic response of his, right? Or if he passes away and those that take over, that should be an automatic, compassion should be your automatic response, right? Of course, for me, that's what it is. It's an automatic response of like, "How can I help this situation? How can we help this situation? What needs to happen?"

Right, like I mean, yes, this stuff happens [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2263s) over in the world, but we're talking about something, an institution that considers itself a mainstream Christian church, has charity status, and has 55,000-plus members that it's, that are following it. Compassion should be at the forefront, and those actions should show to whether you are a part of their community or outside of their community or somebody who has left the community.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2284s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2288s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2289s)

I think Bruce Hales should ask himself, "What would Jesus do?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2292s)

Yes, exactly. Yeah. But I think his messages that he thinks comes from Jesus are from a different Jesus than what true Christians get their messages from, or that you know, like it's just...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2308s)

Maybe he's schizophrenic.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2310s)

Maybe. Hey, we digress.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2316s)

Anyway, when Braden was withdrawn from in 2019, the two brothers that were handling his matter, they asked me to go up. The day before, they went over what they were planning to do, which had obviously come from Bruce Hales, and they asked me if I'd say something in the assembly meeting to agree with the action.

And your own son, yeah. I just, I said to them, "I would not." I told them I didn't agree with his withdrawal. So, you know, I openly disagreed with the action, even though I knew it had come from Bruce. And so I just didn't even go out to the meeting when he was withdrawn from. And from that time on, I started raising my concerns about Bruce with several responsible people in Auckland, and obviously, it all got relayed back. He was getting worried that some of it would come out into the light, and you know, made him pretty angry, obviously.

Like, for example, over the learning center scam, he told Peter Bishop and Brian Johnson that [he'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2404s) had absolutely nothing to do with it, which they relayed back to me. But like, it's just simply untrue. It's false. I had evidence that he had been closely involved with it. So, and I raised a number of other matters at the same time, including the way that Richard Marsh had been so cruelly mistreated. As far as I could see, he should have been commended for what he did by exposing that thing, but instead [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2434s) condemned.

There were three priests that served me in the end, and they sort of were a bit gentle with me, and they were trying to just talk me around and persuade me to not ripple the pond too much and so on. You know, that there were explanations for everything that I'd raised, and their attitude became increasingly threatening as time went by. This was over the space of about eight months. It got more and more threatening.

About a week [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2464s) I was shut up, I was called to a meeting, and essentially, the three brothers individually, they basically threatened me. There was an explicit threat that if I didn't accept that Bruce had done nothing wrong, I'd have to be shut up. I didn't accept it, and here I am. But these guys, the three brothers, I like them, you know, they're decent people.

And even I went and spoke to my uncle, Harold Simmons, about my concerns. This is only a few days before I was shut up. And he'd been the leader in Auckland for a long time under John Hales, but it's just totally spineless. If it's Mr. Hales, it's the divine sovereignty. You just, you'd never prosper if you get up [against](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2519s) divine sovereignty, so just accept that, leave it there.

You know, I'd just love to appeal to anyone that's in the brethren, especially responsible persons in Sydney, if any of them get to see this, like persons like John Anderson and Phil McNaughton and Charlie Baker. There's a few others. I don't know who's still in fellowship, even in Sydney these days. But if you do watch this, please don't dismiss it as someone with a grievance [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2549s) an axe to grind, because that's not why I'm speaking.

But if you really believe that Bruce Hales is the personification of Christ and the Holy Spirit, well, you cannot have had a real experience with Jesus as I have, because there's an enormous gulf between them. A couple of scriptures, passages of scripture, I'd quite like to draw attention to. One I referred to earlier, John's gospel chapter 3, verses 19-21: "And this is the judgment, that light [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2584s) come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, for their works were evil. For everyone that does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, that his works may not be shown as they are. But he that practices the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God."

In 1 Timothy chapter 6, verses 6 to 10: "But piety with contentment [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2614s) great gain. For we've brought nothing into the world, it's manifest that neither can we carry anything out. But having sustenance and covering, we'll be content with these. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many unwise and hurtful lusts which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is the root of every evil, which some having aspired after have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2650s)

So it literally sums the brethren up in like two scriptures.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2653s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2655s)

Is that the same light in the first scripture as what they say that we've turned our backs on?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2665s)

Well, it's in black and white, you know. So in the face of that scripture, why would you, anything a Christian's life should be an open book. That used to be said in the brethren, should be an open book. You should, other people should be free to look at any aspect of your life at any time. So if it is, well, let's have a look at some of these things, matters that I've raised, for example. The reaction I got to all the matters I raised was [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2695s), you know, "Don't go there," you know, "Shut it."

There's a couple of other matters I'd quite like to touch on briefly. I could go on for hours, actually, with criminal actions and unspeakable cruelty and fraud and deceit done by responsible persons in the brethren, but I just want to shine the light on a few matters, and I hope that it will arouse some exercise in [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2725s) least a few people still inside.

So firstly, I think it should be obvious to anyone examining the facts that there was no scriptural or moral basis for my withdrawal. I just want to make it clear that I'm not looking for sympathy. In actual fact, if you understand what I'm saying, I'm actually thankful to have been withdrawn from, just from the point of view that it's opened my eyes much clearer [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2756s) the true position and to my relationship with Christ has become a lot stronger since I was withdrawn from. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2767s)

 Yeah, but it's important to point out the facts.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2769s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2770s)

So you got withdrawn from, you came into the light, Steve.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2774s)

So after the Tuesday night meeting when I was withdrawn from, Peter Bishop and Brian Johnson, two brothers that were serving me, they rang me up to tell me. And the only reason they gave me on the phone was that I'd asked to be withdrawn from, and they'd taken me up on my request. And like, I was just gobsmacked.

But by that, I tried to protest, and I said, "When did I ask to be withdrawn from?" And Peter just said, "Look in your emails," and he hung up. So I went straight away and I searched back through my emails for the past year or so. I couldn't find anything that could be possibly taken as asking to be withdrawn from. So I emailed [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2826s) and I said, "Can you please explain?" They replied saying it was about two years previous.

So I looked back earlier, and sure enough, there was an email just about two months after I was shut up. I'd been starting to feel quite depressed because, you know, the reality of it was all starting to hit home. And I knew down inside that I hadn't done anything wrong. I'd only been trying to get what I regarded as wicked exposed. In my despair, I'd sent an email to the priest and I said something like, "You might as well withdraw from me and be done with it."

So apparently, they brought that up nearly two years later and used that as a basis to withdraw from me. And so I emailed them back and I protested. I said, "Look, you know, I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2883s) under enormous pressure at the time, and I hadn't intended to ask to be withdrawn from." So the next morning, I got a call from Brian, and he told me that the reason for my withdrawal wasn't actually that I'd asked to be, after all. That wasn't the reason. The real reason was that they had to withdraw from iniquity.

So I said, "Well, what's the iniquity that you're withdrawing from?" I said, "I'm not going on with iniquity. I was trying to expose iniquity, so how can you say that [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2919s) trying to, that you need to withdraw from me to withdraw from iniquity?" You know, he was trying to duck and dive and whatever, and bumbling and mumbling, and of course, he couldn't explain what the iniquity was because there wasn't any.

And finally, he said, "Look, Steve, I can't continue talking to you because you're being contentious," which is like referring to some scripture that "contend not with a..." or something. I don't know which [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2949s) code word that you...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2950s)

Weren't being submissive and exactly as they said, no matter what.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2954s)

Yeah, if they feel like they're being forced into a corner, then they just say, "Oh, you're being contentious, I can't keep speaking to you." It's just childish. Anyway, so I wrote to them again a couple of days later and I asked for a face-to-face meeting. And on Monday night, this is six days after I was withdrawn from, I just got home from work and my phone rang, and it's Peter Bishop. And he was wanting to explain the reasons for my withdrawal over the phone.

And I said, I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=2985s), "No, I asked for a face-to-face meeting." He said, "Oh, we're not prepared to do that at the moment." It was, of course, they were all only acting under direction from Sydney. But so then he proceeded to tell me that the actual basis for my withdrawal was not, it was neither that I'd asked to be, nor that I'd been going on with iniquity, but the real reason was that I questioned the assembly judgments in other localities and had refused to accept witness.

So, like, I'd been given three different reasons over the space of six days. It was obvious that Peter and Brian were both like way out of their depth. I think Bruce was too. And all they could do was like throw a lot of mud and hope that some would stick enough to carry the consciences of the brethren and make me look like an opposer. And so they basically left with no option but to cut me off.

And they weren't going by [scriptural](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3052s) principles. I'm fairly sure that many of the local brethren would have been quite uneasy about it. I think the local brethren would know that I'm not an opposer, but if any of them had raised any question or concern publicly or even privately, it could have resulted in them coming under the same judgment. And to me, it's clear that I was just being made an example of, so that basically any member of the brethren knew that if you got up against Bruce, [you'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3082s) basically, you'd be just, you'd be dealt with without mercy.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3087s)

Were you actually against him personally though, or were you against Bruce's dealings?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3093s)

Not at all. I said that, I told that to them time and time again. I said, "I'm not against any person. All I'm asking for is for these matters to be reviewed properly." There's quite, there's a massive difference between being opposed to a person and being wanting matters to be looked at, which is all I was asking for. And it's an important point these days. In the PBCC, you get excommunicated for being opposed to Bruce Hales, not for being opposed to the Lord Jesus. It's essentially, it's become the Church of Bruce.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3135s)

100%, yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3137s)

If you blaspheme his name or speak against him, then you're not fit for being in fellowship. To me, that's totally wrong.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3146s)

Or if you go up against something that you witnessed that was wrong or you're trying to bring it to light. I mean, the same thing happened to somebody that was trying to address what was going on in Maple Creek just recently, right? Like someone tried to press it and completely booted out. So really, it is, they just don't want to look at the stuff that has come to light.

I mean, we're into podcast number 92, 93, something like that. Anybody who I've talked [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3176s), nobody has come to them and said, "Hey, what's going on here? Can we sit down?" Let's, nobody's contacted me. Nobody's contacted me. It's just so utterly hypocritical and non-Christian the way that they deal with life within there. And I'm not saying that this stuff doesn't happen everywhere, it happens everywhere, but that's why we have legalities in place. That's why there's a system in place to help this kind of situation.

Calling the [police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3206s) is not a bad thing. Let's get these people help. I have said that I don't even care if my perpetrator gets cuffs and handcuffs on him. I don't care about that. I want, I know of his illness. I had his illness all over me for how many years. He needs help, right? So I guess my biggest thing after just everything that you've explained here is that it is, it's easier for them to just take out anybody who is up against exposing [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3237s) trying to fix an issue that is in there, right?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3240s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3240s)

And what is happening is that it's just folding in on itself at this point, right? People are seeing through this. Yeah, it's just heart-wrenching, absolutely heart-wrenching.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3251s)

It is, it's heart-wrenching. But I'm shocked by what you say that so many of these matters that have come out in your podcast, you think the first thing that the brethren should do is go and contact these people and say, "Look, you know, what your story is just is really, really heartbreaking. And I'm so, so sorry that it came to that. And what can we do to put it right?" If what you say, that [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3282s) never happened, that's even, yeah, it's really sad.

And I mean, to me, it's not, justice can come in many forms, right? So I don't hold my breath on, you know, having these people locked up in jail, right? Like I don't, I mean, that's just a route I went because it was a route that led a paper trail. It was important to do it, it's there. But I don't hold my breath on it because I know justice comes in many, many, many forms, and we are having more success with what we're doing here than any of us could have ever imagined.

I mean, [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3318s) we had recorded your podcast on Unispace and went for a walk, I just sobbed. I sobbed, but happy tears. Happy tears in the sense that none of us could have ever dreamt of us all coming together like this in all different walks of life. We all wear different bruises, we all bleed differently, we all have different walks of faith, but yet we're all coming together for one goal in mind, and that is accountability within the PBCC.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3346s)

Yeah, that's really good, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3350s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3351s)

If you could leave the brethren without having your life destroyed, that'd be one thing. But like, if you were unhappy with...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3360s)

I don't think there'd be anyone left in there right now.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3362s)

Yeah, I don't know. There would be a lot of people that'll be like a ship without a rudder for a long time. They just pinned everything on what's coming from Bruce, and to the point where they can't even, they're kind of left with no personal ability to work out right from wrong, almost. You know, if Bruce says it's right or it's wrong, well, that's what you go by.

There's a lot of people that have just forgotten or never learned how to exercise their own judgment, I think. And so when it comes, when it [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3405s) all does come down, there's going to be a lot of people that are just like totally lost. I think a lot of brethren, obviously, the price of leaving is just too high. Sort of losing all your contact with your family and your friends and your children and your grandchildren and your siblings, and possibly losing your job or your business and starting a new life outside, it's just [too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3435s) daunting.

And of course, Bruce is, he's very good at purchasing loyalty from anyone he thinks is useful, may be useful or influential. He can make you feel special, you know, give you a little bit of prominence or money or whatever just to feel that you're tied in. Peter Bishop, I think he's a fairly prime example. He's got a beautiful building in a prominent [location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3465s) in Auckland. Yeah, there it is. It's a really nice building right beside the motorway. You know, it's very high visibility.

Well, a whole floor of that is rented by UBT, and another whole floor is rented by the New Zealand National School, and a whole bunch of other brethren businesses from out of Auckland rent office space there.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3488s)

Doesn't really shout humbleness.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3492s)

I don't know how much he'd be getting from the brethren in rent every year, but hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, could be close to a million. I've got no idea. No idea. He can't afford not to be 100% loyal to Bruce because all it would take is one word from Bruce, and like UBT would get out and the school would get out and the brethren would all leave him. He'd be left with no tenants.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3522s)

Yeah, he really buys his people. He buys his members. 100%.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3526s)

Yeah, yeah. Going back to the Faith and Practice charter given to the UK's commission, it's very explicit about the basis for excommunication. So again, in section six, which has got a subtitle of "Compassion," interestingly, in clause six, it says, "The final stage," yeah, that's section six, "Compassion," and this is a sub-clause of that.

"The final stage of assembly admonition would be excommunication, this being necessary when a person leaves and separates themselves from the assembly entirely on their own personal decision and accord, in which case their position as a member of the assembly becomes untenable. And in other rare cases, [rare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3579s) cases where excommunication is necessary as an extreme or last resort measure for serious misdeeds wholly at odds with basic scriptural teaching."

"Even in cases of excommunication, there is follow-up pastoral and shepherd care in view, the possibility of re-including the person concerned in fellowship and the restoration of him or her to full privileges as a member of the assembly if he or she wishes."

 I didn't leave on my own decision or accord, and the only other basis given is 

"rare cases where it's necessary as an extreme last resort measure for [serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3627s) misdeeds wholly at odds with basic scriptural teaching."

Well, explain, because I would interpret that "serious misdeeds" as, you know, there could be some criminal activity or whatever that obviously is at odds with basic scriptural teaching.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3647s)

To me, this would apply to somebody who they have been caught having sexual abuse, like someone who's done something, someone who's been a pedophile. That to me, that's what that should apply to, not somebody who is bringing up criminal activity that is happening to try and preserve the integrity of the community.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3668s)

That's, yeah, exactly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3670s)

Over against that statement, I was looking up some ministry from John Hales this morning for something else, and I looked up about assembly discipline. And I know this is John Hales rather than Bruce Hales, but they still stand by, oh yeah, John Hales, they still stand by freaking JND like over 100 years ago. So I think it still matters what he says because [Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3700s) Hales' ministry is basically a photocopy with a bit more money in of, a few more feathers, yeah.

But it says, "It's very solemn because scripture speaks about persons having to be taught by discipline. We don't want that. It has to be, alas, and it pains us. Our whole beings are in pain when we have to resort to discipline to teach somebody something."

That's one reason why they put someone under assembly discipline, to teach them something. And the second one, it's a serious matter if somebody goes to the point where they have to come under assembly discipline. So then you can't express your love. The Lord has to appear that way in Revelation. And he puts a scripture to it, sorry, it's Revelation 1, verse 13, "girt about the paps with a golden [girdle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3759s)."

"So that's why we only resort to it when there's nothing else that we can do. We look for every possible avenue of avoiding executive action of that kind. And when there's nothing else we can do, we have to resort to it. But even then, it's recovery that's in mind."

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3777s)

Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, the brothers would say that they tried and tried and tried. Like, as I said, it was over a period of eight months or so that they were trying to talk me around, if you like. So they'd probably say, "Well, we did, you know, it was a last resort." But what about, it was a last resort to try...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3795s)

And get you to submit, though, right? It wasn't a last resort for you guys to come to terms on what you're trying to deal with. It was a last resort because you wouldn't submit to them.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3805s)

Yeah, and "serious misdeeds wholly at odds with basic scriptural teaching." That's, you know, so yes, if there was a pedophile or a molester or something or other, and they worked with him and worked with him to try and get him to come to a judgment of it, and he carried on with it, well, yes, that's clear.

One of the reasons I was withdrawn from was refusal to accept witness. Well, in my mind, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3835s) witness was false witness. There was witness given that such and such had, you know, had happened or whatever, so-and-so was guilty of this. Those assurances contradicted the facts. So therefore, they're false witness. So the witness that I refused to accept was false witness.

I think that, I think there's a scripture, I can't remember where it is now, but we're not called to accept [false](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3865s) witness. Yeah, exactly. And it's not a basis for being withdrawn from if you don't accept false witness. Yeah, so I can't understand how they could possibly shoehorn me into that category.

So I've written to brothers several times, actually, to ask them to say whether they still believe what that Faith and Practice document says or whether it was just a big whitewash to trick the Charities Commission into reinstating a charitable status. I think I even emailed Dean Hales once, but not one of them's ever replied. Yeah. And as for the follow-up pastoral care and shepherd care, well, you know, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3909s) non-existent.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3910s)

We've not been contacted once since we were withdrawn from either. Not that I want to be.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3916s)

At all? No. I said, really, that's shocking though. Yeah. The brothers did email me once a few months after I was shut up to ask if I'd like them to come and visit me. And I replied and I said, "If you want to come and see me to try and persuade me that black is white, up is down, wrong is right, well, you're wasting your time and mine to come and see me."

[That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3946s) about all I said. But, and then a little bit later on, I said something to them about never having followed up on me, and they, "Oh, you know, we tried to follow up on you and you refused to see us." Well, I didn't refuse to see you. I just said, you know, "If you're wanting to tell me that, you know, the opposite, this is wrong is right and right is wrong, well, you're wasting your time and mine." And they never [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3976s) to see me. So I assume that that's what they were wanting to do. So, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3982s)

No, I think you're quite stubborn, and so their, I think that...

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3988s)

My wife's often told me that, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3990s)

I think that their tactics just don't work with you, and that's why they probably just wash their hands of you.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=3997s)

Yeah. Yes, I've actually written to the brothers and even to my family, and I've stated quite clearly in writing, I believe that the core doctrine, which is also part of that Faith and Practice document submitted to the Charities Commission, that I believe that they're scripturally sound. I've asked them, "Are you prepared to put your name [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4028s) writing to say that you believe that they're true and right?"

The only reply I had was from my wife, who wrote something to the effect that that document was produced to meet a specific need for a specific area, like the UK, at a specific time. So essentially, what I took out of that, she must have talked to Peter and Brian about it, I don't know, what I took out of that was that it didn't [apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4058s) now. It was because the brethren wanted their charitable status back, they produced the document, it served its purpose, doesn't apply now.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4068s)

Well, she hit the nail on the head, didn't she, to be fair to her.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4072s)

Because obviously they don't want to lose the charitable status, because that would mean they could lose millions of dollars a year, which would be, you know, that we couldn't possibly have that. So, but you'd think that Christians should be clear and unambiguous in stating what they believe and acting according to what they've said. Say something and then do it. But [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4102s) that's just like sort of politicians, really. They say what's appropriate at a certain time or depending on who it's to and so on.

And a prime example of that is something that happened last year, 24th of March last year. I got a letter from Peter and Brian, Peter Bishop and Brian Johnson, which contained the following statements relating to reasons for my withdrawal:

 "You were withdrawn from for challenging and refusing to accept as right [assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4139s) judgments in other places and a refusal to accept witness. This was, is true and is further evidenced by your refusal to disassociate from Braden. You clearly don't accept the way brethren apply assembly discipline."

I'd like to emphasise that last sentence:

 "You clearly don't accept the way the brethren apply assembly discipline." 

And they also wrote, you know, 

"We [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4169s) held for years that separation should be moral, physical and legal." 

And then about a week after that, on the 30th of March, an article was published in the media in New Zealand quoting Doug Watt, he's from Christchurch, he's the New Zealand media spokesman for the PBCC. He said; 

"If a person leaves our church, it's up to them and their family to choose what their relationship looks like going forward. It is certainly not standard church practice to interfere in this decision."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4204s)

Yes, I've pulled it up here, and I'll attach the link to this article. But yeah, it says right here, 

"From time to time, a person will decide to leave our church. This is rare and it is sad, and when it does occur, we wish the person well."

 Again, I mean, some of their spokesmen, people that say what they say, it's just absolutely ludicrous what they say. And here is the quote, the statement that Steve just read: 

"If a person leaves our church, it is up to them and their family to choose what the relationship looks [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4235s) going forward. It is certainly not standard church practice to interfere in this decision."

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4239s)

The letter from Peter and Brian a week before was a blatant contradiction to what appeared in the press. So they told me in writing I didn't accept the way the brethren apply assembly discipline, but the spokesman says that it's up to the family, to them and their family, to choose what the relationship looks like, and the church doesn't interfere in this decision. Well, you know, it's just a blatant lie [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4269s) Doug told the press. I don't know how he sleeps at night sometimes after, you know, putting out such nonsense.

So I wrote to them and I pointed out it was contradictory and false, and I asked which version is true, but they didn't reply, of course.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4291s)

I love how you keep going at them and looking for accountability. They must really hate you.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4296s)

Yeah, I know. I'm a little bit of a thorn in the side, probably. But I'm baffled as to how grown men can lie in public and still claim to be Christians. Yeah. But the only explanation I can think of is that Bruce Hales said something recently, I think it's in the white book, something to the effect that the use of deceit is completely justified, which was in reference to persons they regard as opposers.

And so I assume it means that it's okay to deceive and lie if it's to protect the testimony from opposers, even if the opposers are not opposed to Christianity but just to the blatant corruption that's in the hierarchy. And a couple of years earlier, there's been an article published that the way private investigators have been following various ex-brethren in [New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4352s) Zealand, including Braden and Lindy, my children, which had obviously been set on and paid for by someone in the brethren, if not by UBT.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4365s)

There are so many scriptures about deceit, though. 1 Peter 2 speaks about ridding yourselves of all malice and deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. So where does that align with what Bruce Hales has brought out in ministry? Isn't it in a Ten Commandment as well about deceit? Or is that...

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4391s)

No, I don't, yeah, bearing false witness, yeah. I don't think it is about deceit. So the reporter asked Doug Watt for his comments so that they could present, you know, a balance. And Doug said,

 "While we cannot comment on the actions of every individual within our church, it's certainly true to say that the church leadership has absolutely no knowledge or involvement in the matters you've described."

And he went on to [say,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4421s)

 "Just like any church, we're sad if someone leaves us, but we wish them all the best in their lives. We strive to live a community-minded life following the teachings of the Holy Bible and centred around the values of care, charity and compassion."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4437s)

If only it was like that, right?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4440s)

My mind boggles.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4442s)

But also, not any church is sad if someone leaves them. Like, if you're going on to another church, for example, if you move house, they're not sad if someone leaves them. They encourage them and like, "We hope you get on all right, and we'll miss you, but all the best whatever you choose next." Like, that's bullshit. Like, all it is.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4471s)

The letter from Peter and Brian that I referred to a few minutes ago, that was in reply to a letter I've written to them which was protesting about my wife getting a legal separation, going for division of assets, which I've protested vigorously against every step of the way. Doesn't seem to be any way I can stop it. And some factors, as far as I'm concerned, that [she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4502s) got no moral or scriptural basis to separate from me, even if there had been a right basis for my withdrawal, which I don't think there is.

About 40 years ago, I think in the '80s, the government in New Zealand was planning to change the law to remove adultery as a basis for divorce. And at the time, I clearly recall the brethren lobbying, I think they were in contact with every member of parliament, [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4533s) "leave adultery as a basis for divorce" because it was the only scriptural basis.

Now, brethren are quite happy to overlook what it says in the Bible and force husbands and wives to separate just because one party refuses to bow down and worship their, you know, their supposed leader. So I don't know whether the Lord must have done like a full U-turn, not just turned a corner, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4563s) one. I've written to several brethren asking them to clarify what the brethren believe, you know, do they believe the Bible or not? But I've never had any reply there.

And about 18 months ago, I made an unconditional written commitment before God to my wife and family to provide generously for her as long as I'm able to. So for a Christian man to put a [written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4594s) committal before God, signed, that's not acceptable, apparently, if the man's regarded as an opposer. And so she's refused to accept it. She's using very expensive lawyers, including a King's Counsel, which I've got to pay for. So I'm paying for lawyers to screw me.

Her and the family are still beneficiaries of my will, and I'm not wanting to be unreasonable. I'm not trying to be a skinflint or anything else. I'm quite happy for her [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4624s) take, you know, to provide for her needs, but the business needs money to function, and if I've got to give it all to her, the business simply can't survive. You know, so it just makes no sense. I'm not blaming my wife at all for any of this. It's, she's obviously being told what to do and say from Bruce. You know, I hold him [responsible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4654s), not her.

Peter Bishop actually came around to my house about a year ago. He had told me that he had some positive suggestions to make about the separation and the division of the assets and so on. I seriously didn't want to see him, but he insisted on coming. And this positive message that he was carrying to me was that, 

"We're going to use every legal means possible to get every cent we can from you. So instead of fighting it, why don't you just accept that it's going to happen and hand over two-thirds without a fight, including two-thirds of the business value and the building and everything?"

He said two or three times, referring to the court action, if I did resist, he said, "It'll get ugly." And I asked him several times, "Where do Christian principles come into this?" And he replied, "We're not going by Christian principles, we're going by the law." Is that, they're two separate things. I'd just like everybody to stop and think about this. This is a Christian organization, not just any Christian organization, this is the ultimate Christian organization, the best in the world, saying, 

"It's going to be ugly, we're going to take you to court if you don't hand over this money, and we're not even, we're not going by Christian principles, we're going by the law."

So they've given up. They're not even bothering to try and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4757s) pretend that they're acting according to Christian principles anymore. What a despicable thing to say.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4767s)

I picked my jaw up off the ground. To me, those are not two separate things. Christianity is the embodiment. You are walking it, you are it. It is, it's not something you just take out of you and put it over to the side and be like, "Okay, I got to be the law right now." And that's what's wrong with this cult. That is exactly what is wrong with this cult. Is they have, they take this personification of what they believe Christianity to be, and they don't become it. They are just, it's just a mask they put on. It's [clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4797s) that they put on and take off whenever they want.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4799s)

Yeah, exactly. I came away from that and I thought, you know, and then it's, it's not even a, Peter Bishop is, he's high up in the whole, you know, in the hierarchy and everything else, and he's close to Bruce and everything. And this is the way he's prepared to speak. I don't know if he was told what to say or what, but it's certainly this is what they're doing. And so Christian principles just completely go out the window. They're not even taken into consideration.

I mean, they're prepared to spend [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4836s) to do anything to defend the testimony, which, and by testimony, that means Bruce Hales and his cronies, you know, to destroy lives, destroy marriages, ruin people financially, drive people even to suicide. The Apostle Paul used his authority for building up, not for overthrowing. These guys are using their authority for crushing and destroying, not for building up.

I don't know if it's good to refer to it, but guys like Putin in Russia, he [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4866s) face any opposition. So all his opposers end up in jail, or they fall out of windows, or their aircraft sort of mysteriously crash. You know, it's the same character of things, unfortunately, that anybody that's regarded, that doesn't submit, just stuff happens to them.

You know, so I'd like to challenge or appeal perhaps to everyone that's still in the brethren who might be watching this. [If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4897s) you put a man like Peresi that I referred to at the start of this podcast over on one side, and then you put Bruce Hales and a lot of his, the other so-called leading brothers around the world on the other side, and then you were asked to judge which side is more like the Christ that you read about in the Gospels or in Isaiah 53, say, which side would you choose? Seriously.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4928s) on one side, you've got a penniless, humble man who's spent his entire life and everything he had on helping others to find a savior. On the other side, you've got rich men living in luxury and crushing anyone that Bruce regards as a threat. So who are you pinning your faith on? There's no doubt that God's got his men in the world that he is pleased with and working with. But where are they?

So if you're looking for a successful man with lots of natural talent, well, I suggest that you read Isaiah 53 again, which we all know: 

"He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=4998s)

Is that a scripture about the Lord, yeah?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5002s)

It's prophetic about the Lord, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5005s)

Okay.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5009s)

Left alone of men, men of sorrows, from whom men hide their faces. That's the character of man that we should be looking up to, you know. But the devil's, seems to me the devil's just, he's succeeded in deceiving thousands of brethren to go after a natural man, intelligent, smart. But go and study the Bible, ask God to open your eyes so you can see clearly where he is and where he isn't, and get back to basic truths.

Make a stand. Maybe you'll be persecuted for it, but that's, Jesus said we should expect to be persecuted. I'm not despondent, I'm not bitter. I didn't come on to this podcast to try and get even [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5065s) take anyone down or anything. The only reason I've done it is because I just really love to see the brethren delivered from the bondage that they're under and from a web that's really been woven around them.

For myself, I regard Jesus as my best friend, and I've got far more peace now and joy than I had while I was in the brethren. I just, I live by myself, but I keep busy, I try to keep active, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5095s) and many others have suffered far, far more than I have. I really admire the courage of many others that have been on this podcast, like Cheryl and Carman, Richard and Abi, many others.

But I'm settled in my faith that God has got his hand over it all, and everything will be brought into the light one day. And but when it does, there's going to be like so much remorse. People are just going to be so [ashamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5125s) of what they've done. I think it says somewhere in the Bible about asking mountains to fall on them. And you know, perhaps for some, the remorse and regrets might remain with them throughout eternity, which is a pretty sobering thought.

Anyone that's suffered and found peace and relief through Jesus, I'm sure they'll enjoy the sense of love and blessing throughout eternity, and that's what I'm holding on to. So that really, that's about all I've got to say, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5162s)

You've given them inside a lot to think about, especially with your last podcast you did. And then this one, this one really touches home to the heart of it all, right? It really does. This is the one that is making that plea out to like, it's in black and white, especially with, you know, the comparison between Bruce and Peresi. That's such a stark example of what Christianity is and what [Christianity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5193s) is not. Yeah.

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5195s)

Yeah, well, I'm sure there's thousands of brethren who are actually genuine, genuinely want to do what's right. I agree, yeah. And their senses have just been, they've been dulled off by the continual teaching and so on. And what I'd love to do is to just give them a fresh, like a basis to have a fresh look at what true Christianity looks like, and then compare it to what they're under at the moment and say, "Well, hang [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5233s), no, it doesn't make sense."

You know, and then not everyone's going to be able to make a stand, you know. And then anyone that does make a stand, well, there's going to be a risk that they might get into trouble or, you know, whatever. But eventually, what I'm, what I've been praying for, I guess, myself is that there'll be a groundswell of reaction, enough sufficient that the brethren say, "Hang on, [let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5263s) stop and just have a review of all of this, where we are."

You know, the whole UBT system, the RRT system, which the Bible is very clear about about charity, how you, the Lord speaks very scathingly about persons that go around with a trumpet sort of saying how when they give charity, RRT sort of promoting themselves all the time [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5294s) whenever they do anything. Well, that's to me, that's going completely against what the Lord says about how you should give, how you should act when you're doing charitable work, for example.

You know, so just look at all this. But I'd love for the brethren generally to be able to get to see this or read it at least or listen to it somehow, just to give them the [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5324s) courage to look, "Well, hang on, maybe we are being deceived." That's my motivation, if you like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5336s)

One of the questions I want to ask you is, what would you say to your children that are still inside there?

### [**Steve Simmons**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5342s)

Well, I wrote to them a while ago and to set out my own position, and based on scripture. Like, anytime I've written to anyone, to my family or to the brothers or whatever, I've always referred to scriptures, not to ministry or just personal experiences or anything else. I've always said, "This is the scripture." And so I wrote to my family, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5372s) children, and I said where I stood, based it on scripture, and appealed to them.

And I got a reply from them. One replied on behalf of all of them, but basically, he said that they were committed to Mr. Hales. And I replied again, and I said, "Look, I'm committed to the Lord Jesus Christ as revealed in the scriptures. I can't put my trust in a man." My response is that I'd go back to what Peresi said to me: "Never let any man come between you and Christ." Yeah, I think that's what's happened. And I think that's really what underlies the way the position has now become. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5432s) because they've allowed a man to come between them and Christ.

So really, that's all. And I just, I pray all the time that my family, that their eyes will be open, their heart will be open, that God will just sort of reveal to them. Yeah, I don't want them to come to the point where they'll just be full of remorse when it finally does all fall apart.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5462s)

Well, thank you so much, Steve. You have put a lot of time and effort into both these podcasts, and I am sure they're going to reach people far and wide. We have many options for those insiders to listen to these now, so they are definitely watched from inside. I hope that your message is received well, and I know that those people that have one foot in, one foot out definitely will hear this. And I guess I just add to your plea that I hope that they [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apZobJIkL0&t=5492s) sit down and again choose between one side or the other, right? You laid it out very well. Yeah. So thank you so much, and thank you, Abi, for joining us. Okay, no worries. Thank you. Bye. Yeah, take care everyone, and until next time, much love to you all. Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
