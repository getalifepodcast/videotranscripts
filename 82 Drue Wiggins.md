## Summary

The Aberdeen scandal was portrayed as a ‘test of the fellowship’ to those inside the brethren. Yet ,some who were close to those involved witnessed the build-up to the events of 1970 and were not in the least surprised when the scandal became public.
Drue Wiggins was one of those people. Join us as she talks from the diaries that she kept from her time in the brethren. She describes how she witnessed first hand behavior's that came to a crescendo at Aberdeen.
These events ultimately lead to Drue packing her bags and leaving the brethren, resulting in her losing all contact with her parents.
This conversational podcast gives further insight into a pivotal moment in PBCC history. How has this era of history influenced the PBCC as we know it today?

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith, and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression, and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to the Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=58s)

Good evening everyone, welcome to the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with my friends Anne and Gilli and Ross and we have a very special guest with us this evening, Drue Wiggins. Drue left the Brethren some time ago and has very vivid memories of how the Brethren changed from the late 50s and through the 60s and was also around and in the Brethren at the time of the infamous 1970 Aberdeen story.

So I will hand the microphone over to you, Drue, and you can start your story at the beginning, thank you.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DuU1qnQumLOk%26t%3D96s)

Well thank you. I hope it means something to you because I'm very aware that more recently the podcasts have been from younger people and perhaps they don't know the history of what happened before. So that's what I thought I would come to, really. So I lived in Harrow from 1957, I think, onwards. And the meeting started off OK, but then it became very much them and us with the very rich people [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=127s) the sort of poor people, lesser known ones.

So it became very much political, I suppose is the word, and they picked over everything. I would tell you from my diary which I kept, every week you would see that just about every week there would be care meetings, there would be confession meetings, there would be someone being thrown out, someone shut up, someone walking out and banging the door. There were disagreements the whole time. It [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=157s) was horrendous when I look back and think about it. We were not so in the hierarchy, but my parents were very good. They were very committed.

But my father did all the amplification in meetings, so that took a lot of his time. My mother was a great hospitable person, so we always had people in. The house was always full of people, which was lovely. I loved that. I miss it, actually.

But then commercialism came in, a lot of commercialism. And I don't know whether you knew, but we all had to make marmalade and tomato ketchup and cakes and bread and sell it to each other after the meeting. It was absolutely crazy. And some of the stuff was not even edible. So that was a bit of commercialism we had then. Now, this is under the original Bruce Hales, not the current one. So we're really going back.

In 1960, it was more confessions, totally confessions about all sorts. In one meeting we had one brother who was not very desirable, I have to say. He confessed to my father that he'd been looking at dirty seaside postcards. My father nearly cracked up at that one because he'd seen them anyway.

Another chap, he was really taken to task because he confessed he'd been found on top of the cook on the kitchen or canteen floor at the Brethren Building Company. So you can imagine what that was. I mean, it was just scandal the whole time, it really was. My father worked at that company, so we know who it was, obviously.

And then we had Mr. Ker, and he confessed to incest with his sister. This is back in 1960\. Wow. So you can see we were not horrified when it all happened at Aberdeen.

But it was very serious, to be honest. I mean, I'm laughing now, but it was awful at the time. And they picked on the sisters. We had meeting after meeting about what we wore, our shoes, our hair, our clothes. They were always on your back, really. So it was a very miserable time.

Oh, just at the end of 1960, the open basket for collection came in. So that was that, you all had to watch. Now I had to laugh because we had a chap who had come in from the outside, as they call it. And when the basket went round, he put a £10 note in and took a fiver out because he wanted change. Well, you can imagine that went down very well.

So we did have fun, I must admit. We just saw the funny side.

'61 was full of mass exodus meetings, you know, lots of people leaving. And then the kids weren't allowed to go to school assemblies, so of course, I was kept out of that. You had to go in at the end for the notices with the JWs. And then they got it in their bonnets that anyone working away from home, children working away from home, all had to come home. So my two sisters had to come home from their jobs where they were.

So that was another one. Now we get to the Kers, and my parents were extremely prudish, you could not imagine how prudish they were, and they were asked to go to tea at the Kers.

And to their extreme embarrassment, Alan and Madeline asked my parents' advice on sexual activity, what they should do, how to make it less painful. You can imagine my parents just about cracked up. They didn't know what to say because they don't talk like that anyway. So to be asked by Alan and Madeline how to do it and what. Can you imagine?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=393s)

This would have been in the 60s?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=401s)

1961, yeah. I mean, it's just horrendous. You can see why I'm leading up to Aberdeen. I mean, they were just full of this all the time. So that was an absolute hoot, actually, when we got home. And so it seemed that they were obsessed with sexual matters, it really did.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=420s)

 I was going to say that. I mean, in the normal world at that time, that would have been very unusual, wouldn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=425s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. I'm also, I just want to ask the question because it's quite personal to a lot of things that have been discussed recently. When Mr. Ker confessed in the meeting to incest with his sister, was anything done about it? Now, I would point out this was obviously a long time ago when the authorities perhaps wouldn't have been aware generally in the world that these things happen and how to deal with them, but was anything done about it apart [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=455s) forgiving him or anything? No.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=458s)

No, no, just forgiving him. You know, our brother's confessed and we forgive him. He obviously was a bit quiet for one, I think. Yes. But yeah, I can see him now and I know the sister of what she looked like. Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=473s)

Oh yeah, I mean, I appreciate it was a different era for that type of thing in the 60s anyway, compared to now. Yeah. But it's interesting that the issues that are coming to light now were going on way back then as well. Exactly. Exactly.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=489s)

So then what happened? Oh yes, we got it, we three girls got it for the clothes we wore, our hair, our hats, you know, everything really. We were told off for laughing in the meeting and Alan Ker was really furious with us, but we just saw the funny side because it was so awful. If you didn't laugh, what would you do? You know, so that was it. Um, what happened then? Oh yeah, 1963, of course, the meeting times changed to nine o'clock [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=526s) the breaking of bread, 12 and 3\. That was it.

My father was very rudely treated. He spent a fortune on amplification, but they didn't appreciate it. In October '63, we had this ministry about the breaking of bread, that when you handed the bread to the person next to you, you gazed into their eyes, and similarly for the wine. So we all had to look at each other, but we didn't want to look at each other at all.

It was stupid, absolutely stupid. And I had a Japanese car, a Mazda, and I offered a lift to a young brother because he had a long way to walk to the meeting. He refused to get in because it was Japanese.

It was just this constant, constant ridiculous rules the whole time. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=572s)

So when you say, Drue, that on Sunday the breaking of bread was moved to nine o'clock and you had nine, twelve, and three, what had been the kind of meeting regime late 50s, sort of early 60s prior to that?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=588s)

11 o'clock, 10 o'clock, and then nine o'clock. As a child, it was 11 o'clock.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=595s)

Okay, and then was there a meeting every evening as well or not?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=600s)

No. So Monday prayer meeting, Wednesday the Bible reading, care meetings on Saturday if there were some. So there weren't so many meetings. No,no. 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=612s)

OK, that was a change that happened in the 60s. I remember my mother saying a similar thing because she joined the Brethren sort of middle late 50s and things changed dramatically in the 60s from the point of view of the meeting regime and the intensity. Is that fair to say that?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=634s)

Very much so, yes. It was getting really ridiculous. Nothing like it is at all.

But yes, I mean, we carried on as a family. My sisters were working. I was, when I'd left school by then, I'd started a job. So, so yeah, that was 19, when did I say '63, I think? Yeah.

So they were on our backs. I think this is not so sad. They were on the backs of people and I don't know whether it's because we knew Alan Ker and whether we had something on him. I don't know. He was really awful to my parents and to my mother and told her she was too house proud, and this is all in public. This is not one-to-one. I mean, they were just so cruel the whole time, really picking on you.

Mr. Taylor, he had three-day meetings at Dorking, but he was too [poorly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=688s). Guess what was the matter with him. And this is way back, this is way back. Um, yeah, then we had, um, in the October, I remember it well because my mother went to, there was a Park Street meeting in London, a big meeting there, and there was mass confessions again.

And they confessed to all sorts of silly stuff. And a dear old 80-year-old brother, he confessed to having stolen a ruler when he was at school, so he was going to take it back. You know, that's the past.

Yeah. I mean, it really was, it was just awful. And the pressure, I think, was so much on you that you had to think of something. There was a lot of sexual stuff confessed and one chap had exposed himself on the London train.

We shouldn't laugh, but it's quite funny. My mother came back full of this, absolutely. You wouldn't believe this, do you? You wouldn't believe it.

But the thing is, what's so sad? I mean, we laugh, what's so sad is you don't forget it. No, I know the name of those people who did that, you know, and you don't need that, do you? You really don't need it all exposed. No, but they seem to wallow in the exposing of people.

Yeah. So then what happened? Oh, we couldn't have any pets. That was another thing. My sister and I had been to Belfast for a weekend and we had two cats when we went. When we came home, they'd gone. And they got rid of them. Do you know whether they were put down or whether they were... Put down. Put down, yeah. Awful. It's awful. Well, you've got to obey the rules, you know. My parents were very good at obeying the rules out of fear, absolute [fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=802s), and that's what's so awful. So we lost our nice little pussycats.

There was a chap in Manchester who was ministering in Harrow meeting one night and someone had told him they didn't think my parents were very affectionate towards one another. Can you imagine this? I mean, it's none of their business. Anyway, so this very posh high-up brother, they called round to have a talk with my parents where we girls were sort of hanging over the banisters. My mother and father sat in the lounge, and the couple [sat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=840s) holding hands on the sofa. My mother's on the piano stool, my father's in the armchair.

They're very concerned that they weren't affectionate enough. And this chap asked my father if he ever gave my mother an unexpected token of affection.

Well, I mean, we just about cracked up when he told us that. We were laughing and my father came up behind my mother and pinched her bottom and said, "There you are, that's the token of affection."

That's the way it got him. It's so silly. It's none of their business.

Also, it's hypocritical, isn't it? You've got the Kers asking for intimacy advice and then you've got the high-ups saying, well, you're not affectionate with one another. So, yeah, yeah. Well, my parents were very old-fashioned, I mean, to be fair, and prudish, and they didn't go all lovey-dovey all over each other. That's just the way they were. You know, it was so rude, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=902s)

What would even be the... if you talk about this, that they came to see your parents in a church context, what is the problem with that? As in, where is the moral sin in that? It's up to a couple, as you say. So it's just bizarre, isn't it? Even back then, it's bizarre. Yeah.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=923s)

Um, yeah, so yes, it was none of their business. But I think, you know, what's so sad is they've got nothing better to think about, yeah, than pick on little pieces of somebody or other. Um, it really wasn't godly at all, to be honest. And they pick up things about things like intimacy and sex, and it actually shows exactly where their heads are at, exactly, thinking about other people's relationships, which, it's, yeah, perverted in itself, [isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=953s) it? Really.

**Ross Turner**

I mean, we had one couple where I was local that, um, they, well, they committed fornication according to the priests, and the priest wanted to know every intimate detail, what position they used and all the rest of it. It's just disgusting, it really is. 

**Drue Wiggins**

It is, it is. It's so sad and they put the Lord's name to it. That's what gets me. They pray before the meeting, excuse me.

It's blasphemy really, isn't it? Well, it is. It is, yeah.

When we got to 1965, oh no, we had Bruce Hales, the original Bruce Hales in Dublin three-day meetings. And it was said that he was the corporeal body showing of Jesus. He was basically Jesus in a body. Wow.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1008s)

And this is the current Mr. Hales's uncle, wasn't it? Bruce Hales's uncle. Yeah.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1014s)

Yeah. And they said that back then. You know, showing Jesus as that's who he was. 

But in the end, they were both withdrawn from, Bruce and John Hales. They were kicked out in '65, October '65.

Don't ask me what about because I can't, I haven't written it down, I can't remember. Is that B.D.H. or W.B.H.?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1041s)

Yeah, W.B.H. Yeah, so John Hales's brother, Bruce's uncle.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1045s)

So if my memory serves me correctly, I think they were withdrawn from over the commerce in the assembly matter. That's right.

Yeah, could well be. And now look at them with commerce in the assembly. It's crazy.

We had another lot of forced confessions in Harrow again, and they passed the mic around from one person to the other and all around the sisters, and you had to think up something to confess. And they waited and waited for you to say something. Guess what I did when it came to me?

I passed the mic on.

Um, on the way out, as you know, Brethren, we talked to you on the way out and how are you and nice to see you. Nobody spoke to me. Six weeks it took for someone to say hello to nice to see you because I hadn't confessed. And you know, I didn't care. But did you have anything to confess? And if you did, what was that of anyone's business anyway? Well, exactly, but you had to think of something. It was awful, and they were saying silly things. I mean, there was a bit pointless really.

It's the fear, utter fear. They just grind you right down, you see. So that was, that was then.

Yeah, that's why I say Harrow was really a horrid meeting. It really was horrid. There was nothing, you know, nothing else.

Or we had times of the prayer meeting, they all had to be changed or something. Mr. Taylor came twice. He came a lot, but twice that year. He came to Harrow a lot. He must have thought we were suckers for it. Then in 1967, Jim Symington appeared at Harrow and we had more confessions. Guess what? We had three confession meetings in one month and in April we had four confession meetings. Don't ask me what they were about now. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1171s) fine. Everybody was so obsessive to everybody about everything.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1175s)

I mean, it was ridiculous. To the listeners who aren't familiar with how a Brethren confession meeting would go, who called it and then what actually happened when you had to confess to these ridiculous things?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1195s)

Well, it's, have you... Yes, I mean, the main person taking it was, you know, like my poor mother, "Mrs. Satchwell, have you anything to confess?" She sat, actually, that meeting, she sat silent and it took two and a half hours and they gave up on her having nothing to confess. They shouted at my mother.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1214s)

So they would literally go around asking people? And would they pick every person in the room?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1219s)

Just no, it was really people that wanted to confess could confess. But then the ones they really wanted to, of course, like my poor mother, she didn't. Yeah, yeah. And they were grinding down, trying to get you to be with them, you know, absolutely 100% with them. It was just cruel. It was cruel. So they tried to break you as a... they tried to break you as a person. That's their aim. 

**Abi**

And I think that's part of the, um, confession thing. It's humiliation, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1249s) almost degradation, really. It completely degrades you as a person. 

**Drue Wiggins**

Oh yes, but that's the control. Yes, the control.

**Ross Turner**

Going back to what you said about JT.Jr. coming to Harrow quite a few times, I'm theorizing, hypothesizing, it's my cynical mind, did he come to Harrow so many times because Madeline Ker was there?

**Drue Wiggins**

Could well have been going on. I know she went to New York with Alan a lot. Yeah, yeah. And Mrs. Taylor had to stomach it that she was under the same roof. Yeah.

**Abi**

I mean... Did you not join in? What the hell? 

**Drue Wiggins**

Yeah, the night my mother refused to confess, I was like, it took two and a half hours. We sang every hymn in the book, you know, just as I am without one plea and I don't know, all these things that are supposed to get you emotional, you see, and she didn't. So the next morning, Madeline Ker, the cheeky woman, rang my mother up and tore her to shreds about it. Really, really awful. Um, so yeah, it wasn't very nice at all. And then of course, we get the 6 a.m. breaking of the bread at the end of that year. So that [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1341s) started.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1341s)

So that's something I'm always quite curious about because, um, I remember my mother telling me it started. She had three small children at the time and her reaction was, "That's ridiculous. I am not getting my three small children up at 5:30 every Sunday morning to break bread," and then promptly did it because that's what you did. So how and why was that introduced and what impact did that have on families at the time?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1369s)

Well, yeah, it was grim and you had to do it. But I never really knew, there's been various theories why it happened. One was that he was in Australia and he had to catch a flight or something and they thought he'd have the Lord's supper before he went. But really, why? I don't remember the actual, you know, truth of why we had to do it. But yes, so we were up, oh, this cat's going mad, we were up very early. It was just awful.

But we three girls let [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1399s) cat out of the bag now. Because, were we in scarves then? I think, oh no, we weren't in scarves, were we? I can't remember where we were in scarves. But we used to go, um, you know, they say the Lord's coming at the breaking of bread. Yeah. So how he's going to come all around the world, I don't know, but never mind. And so we would go in no faith at all that the Lord was going to come at the breaking of bread because we would get up, leave our electric [blankets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1429s) on, and then go back afterwards and get in bed. So we were not very, not very true to the faith, were we?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1437s)

No.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1438s)

Yeah, not at all. But yes, it was awful. 

**Abi**

The, um, what they said about the suppers recently being, like when I've questioned it, like why did they go to six o'clock? They refer to the scripture of the Lord coming like a thief in the night. So you'd have to be at the supper at 6 a.m. because that's still the night. 

**Drue Wiggins**

Oh, I thought that was, well, that's for the rapture. I thought that bit was not for the breaking of the bread.

**Abi**

Yeah, but then they believed that the rapture is going to come in their breakings of bread. So I was always like, okay, you've got, you've got 6 a.m. here, you've got 6 a.m. New Zealand, you've got 6 a.m. elsewhere. That's not the same time. Yeah, it's not the same time globally. And they were like, just [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1492s) worry about it. The Lord knows. The Lord knows how it's going. And I was like, this just doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense now. It was something about the sunrise, wasn't it? Breaking of bread at the sunrise. There was a scripture, I must confess, I've forgotten the quote for that one.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1510s)

I thought, I thought it was something to do with Mary going to the tomb at daybreak. Could be.

We were all told something different, I'm sure.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1525s)

I'm going to go and grab my index and have a look once there. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1528s)

I was going to say, I think...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1529s)

What's coming out of here is nobody actually knows why the breaking of bread... none of us, and we've all had our time in the Brethren, nobody knows why it has to be at 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning. Yeah, crazy, crazy. And then you weren't allowed to speak on the way out, were you? 

**Jacky Hart**

No, no, no, because you had to carry your impression with you and then go and reflect on it, didn't you? Was that... yes.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1554s)

But when you think about it, that was the great thing about it because you could just scuttle home. You didn't have to say that. Yeah. Oh, madness, madness. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1569s)

And when they moved the supper to 6 a.m., so you were having meetings at 9, 12, and 3 on a Sunday, did they then increase the amount of meetings on the Sunday? Because in my day, we had six, sort of through the 70s, there were six in a day on the Sunday. Did they increase that at that time?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1588s)

Yes, we had six o'clock, nine o'clock, twelve o'clock. I think the last one was five o'clock. I'm just trying to think now.

Yeah, yeah, we did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1599s)

They shoved a little one in it, they shoved a little one in at 3:30 as well.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1605s)

Yes, yeah. I know, I know. When I left, they were all that, all day basically. Right now, it was. Yes, yes. Sorry, I didn't quite catch. When did the supper go to six o'clock? Which year was that? December of '67. 

Then in '68, I'm just scanning these things, that they didn't, they decided not to go through a book for their Bible readings, but they would have people's impression, which of course opened up anyone could speak about anything. It wasn't literally the scriptures. I mean, they're based on a text, but that was it. So it's really somebody's impression rather than going through the book of Ezekiel or whatever, chapter by chapter, which is bad in my view.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1656s)

So prior to that decision, again, I'm trying to express, were the readings and the meetings much more a discussion of various scriptures rather than somebody's thoughts on a particular verse of the scripture? So would you say, in other words, if you did sit through a Brethren meeting in the sort of late 50s, 60s, you perhaps got some education about the Bible?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1684s)

Oh, absolutely. I don't regret it because of that. Yes. Oh, you did. And did they go through the Bible book by book, um, in each reading basically?

So, no, I start in Genesis and gradually work the way through. No, not, no, not in that sense. But someone might want Genesis, they do that. Then they might say, oh, we'll do, I don't know, Matthew or something, but it would be a book series sort of thing. Yeah. It wasn't, it wasn't absolutely as they, as the Bible goes.

**Ross Turner**

 I was just, I remember my mum telling a funny story that, um, uh, a brother picked up the mic in meeting and said, um, this would have been when they, they did, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1720s), via the scriptures, and he said, "Where were we last week?" And this little girl pipes up, "Last week I was in Weston-super-Mare making mud pies."

**Drue Wiggins**

 I was thinking of the prayer meetings and what they used to pray for, those brethren who were sick all over the place with their ends in view and all this [rubbish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1751s), rubbish they pray. Oh, we did laugh. I mean, the kids did laugh. You had to, didn't you, really? You had to laugh. Yeah, yeah, you did have to, yeah.

So then in '68, David Clapham from Manchester, he was a big noise in Manchester, you might have heard of him, um, he was suddenly seen in a Soho strip club.

Oh, oh, oh, wow. So that was not good, was it? There's another brother saw him there. Anyway, so he was in that as well.

**Abi**

 He could join Gareth Hales if he was still alive.

**Drue Wiggins**

 Yeah. So that was another one that fell from grace. Um, and then they started on this attendance officers. I don't know if you had that at all. 

**Ross Turner**

Yeah, I mean, like in Symington [era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1806s), they didn't really have them, but they came back, was it in John Hales's time? Um, I can't remember.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1812s)

Yeah, John Hales's time. A lot of, well, that's when a lot of the stuff came back, actually.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1817s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1818s)

You're talking about, um, looking at each other in the supper.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1821s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1822s)

That went sort of during Symington's time, but in John Hales's time, we started doing that again. And it was so strange. You have to look at the eyes of the person next to you that's the emblems. It was weird.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1836s)

Bruce Hales, Lord's Day, June the 23rd, 2002, he said, "The 6 a.m. supper, persons rejected that. They wanted to sleep in on the Lord's Day morning." I mean, it's hard to take it in, isn't it? "See, it's a desire for an easier way, but it's rejection of the person of the Christ. It's a rejection of the minister." That's what it is. So that's how [seriously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1867s) people that thought it was dark out of bed at six o'clock, it's, it's actually a rejection of...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1873s)

That's wicked.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1876s)

Isn't it awful?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1878s)

It is. How can they judge that? Yes, exactly. Nice. That's awful when you hear that read out. It's just...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1887s) 

Yeah. These books need burning, really, but they do come in handy at times. So, no.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1894s)

Don't. Happy they're an invaluable source of information.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1897s)

Yeah, I, um, I found the, um, great men canvas down in the shed.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1903s)

Oh, yeah, we saw that.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1904s)

Yeah, and that was so therapeutic to completely deface that. It was just...

So anyway, that's a by the way, but I'll keep looking. It's, these are just a bit of a minefield, these things, but, um...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1922s)

So at this point, I think we've got up to '67, haven't we, Drue, from your diaries, which must have been valuable. You've written it all down because you've got the dates crystal clear, which is great. Um...

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1936s)

'68, that was a good year for me because I went off to Canada for six weeks on my own.

Um, stayed with Brethren, went to Canada and USA. So it was absolutely brilliant. But the trip opened my eyes, as if I didn't know already, but it really opened my eyes because they weren't so stupid as we were in Harrow, definitely.

And the kids over there, I mean, going on my own was a blessing. My sister was going to come and then she decided no, she wouldn't, so I went on my own anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1967s)

What pretexts were you allowed to go away for that long? 

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=1968s)

Well, because I was staying with Brethren. Yeah, I got away with it. One day my sister said, "You'll never be the same again," and she was absolutely right. My eyes were open big time. The young kids at all the meetings, they were super. They took me out everywhere after the meetings. I mean, I just had a ball. I really had a ball. And they lived normal lives. Um, they ate in restaurants. The girls were wearing, wore culottes, cum trousers. Um, you know, they didn't sort of cover their heads every five minutes. I went to a [motorcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2008s) race one night. I think it was in Winnipeg, I can't remember now where they took me, and had to creep into the old couple I was staying with back again. But I was covered in mosquitoes ready for Sunday, so that was no good, was it? I was really, it caught me out. But no, it was great, and I didn't want to come home. I really did not want to come home.

So, yes, it was quite an adventure, sort of humanly anyway, to go on my own because I wasn't that old.

And, um, then, so I finished up in Toronto and stayed with a lovely family that I kept in touch with, actually. And that was when I first had my whiskey, my first whiskey, because they just dipped it out, so I gave it a whirl.

But I didn't want to come home and I was a different person when I came home because before I went, believe it or not, I never said anything to anybody. I was a very shy little soul. Of course, I talked the longest time, as you can find out, ever since. But yeah, I found my feet, so it was, it was brilliant, a good experience. But my eyes were opened. And so from then, that summer of '68, then you see what's really going on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2084s)

Why do you think that there was such a difference between the Brethren in Canada and in England at that time? Do you think there might...

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2092s)

Don't you think the English sort of, I always used to say, you know, you've only got a whisper, Big Jim's got to whisper and you all go, you know, you join. I mean, we were just so silly, really stupid. Yeah. It was mad. And I used to say to my mother, "If he told you to put your finger in the fire, would you do it?" She would, you know. I mean, it was just crazy. We were so controlled and want, I don't know, the fear, the wanting to be acknowledged, I don't know why.

**Abi**

[What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2123s) I worry about with the Haleses is, you know, I'm sure there's some good Haleses. I mean, some of like Bruce Hales's grandkids are lovely. From my experience when I lived in Sydney, obviously they were young children at that point. They're probably adults now, um, and they've probably been thoroughly brainwashed. But I mean, a lot of the sisters that, you know, 25, 30 plus, um, they fancy the pants off some of Bruce Hales's sons. And they'd drop their knickers if, if they were asked to, because it would be seen as like a privilege or, you know, like a spiritual... [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2173s) don't know, they'd not see it for what it really is. And I wonder, that's if that's what happened with this Ker woman. She thought it was, she thought she was special because it is... yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2188s)

What's also interesting, we've talked a lot in the podcast about the control Bruce Hales has over the Brethren now, but it seems from what you're saying, although the reach would have been different because it was a different era, that control by one man was still there in the 60s. In this, if that one man said jump, the Brethren would say how high. Um, so I don't know what it was like before J.T.Jr., um, but [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2218s) interesting that that the same control that we've talked about a lot now that is so worrying was there then too.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2228s)

I think it's sad, isn't it, that people don't really use their brains. Yeah. You know, they don't wash. Yeah, they don't question. Um, so they go along with it. And fear is the big thing, as you know. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2241s)

Fear of what you might lose. Yes, absolutely.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2244s)

But the children in there are taught not to question things literally as soon as they pop out. So they've kind of inbred this "we don't question things" from, you know, a really, really young age. And me and my husband were so lucky that we did question things. And that's how so many managed to escape, you know. If things [aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2275s) adding up and you're questioning things, you're actually in a good place. It's actually really healthy.

**Ross Turner**

 I often say once you start questioning, you're a goner anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2288s)

I agree, Ross. No independent thinking. No. And another question I wanted to ask, Drue, the phrase that you used about J.T. Jr., "Man of God," which is obviously was used about Mr. James Symington, it was used about John Hales, it's used about Bruce Hales. Is that a phrase you remember being introduced into the Brethren at any stage?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2313s)

No, it's, it's more what I've heard recently from the podcast. As was "our Paul the Apostle." 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2316s)

That's okay. So he was your Paul. I certainly remember Mr. Symington being referred to frequently about "Man of God." I don't know when that phrase came in.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2334s)

Um, yeah, because I left at the start of Symington, so yeah, it could have been. But it was really “our Paul the Apostle."

 Um, in the April of, um, '68 or '69, '68 it'll be, Big Jim was at Edinburgh for three-day meetings. My sister and I went, and we were sleeping on the floor in some friend's house. It was a really great [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2364s), never mind the meeting.

But I had bought, um, a lovely grey suit and I wore a big white sailor hat, you know, with the brim turned back. My sister got another one in navy. And we were sitting up the back with all the young folks at the back of this tiered hall. And Big Jim comes in late. There was what looked like orange juice under his chair. And, um, he got started on the meeting and then he shouted up at me, "You there in the big [white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2394s) hat, come down. I want to look at you." Oh, of course, I was absolutely terrified.

In front of all these people. So I just, you know, sunk in my chair. I did not go down. I was not going down to see him. So it was obvious then, A, he was late, B, he had whiskey under the chair, and C, he was a womanizer. I mean, it was blatant, wasn't it? So that was awful. The next night was the prayer meeting. When we got home, it was prayer meeting time. Of course, they were asking, "Oh, you know, how did you get on? What did our brothers say?" And what could we say? [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2433s) we sort of bluffed our way through that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2437s)

Would you have known he was drunk? I mean, obviously the orange juice, the orange juice under the chair, but would you have known from the way he was talking, in the way he was speaking? 

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2449s)

Yeah, slurred speech. Yeah. That was way back then. Oh, definitely drunk. Yeah. 

**Abi**

In COVID, on a Thursday and Friday, they, um, sent a link to recordings of like past ministry, and somehow they've still got them from all the way back then. Um, I'm sure they're stored away at BGT or something. Um, me and Bruce were so confused why they sent Aberdeen around. They [sent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2480s) the record, the actual recordings of Aberdeen around. We could not understand a word he was saying.

Now, Bruce Hales, it might have been a manipulation that he sent that round because he has always gone along the line that it's a test for the Brethren as to whether they fell for it or not. Um, and he's still bleating on about that today. But when we heard that recording, you can't fake slurred speech. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2510s) I mean, for a start, it's ungodly behavior, and you can't say, it's just physically impossible to slur speech for that long.

And in the end, we just turned it off and you're like, what is this shit? It's like people actually sat through this and thought it was, you know, good. Were you at Aberdeen? 

**Drue Wiggins**

No, we were up in Scotland, but not actually at the meeting. But yes, I mean, I've seen it, I'd seen it before anyway. So I mean, it was no surprise in a way. It was just, he was just the pits, really, was a disgraceful man. When we got to this prayer [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2553s) and we couldn't, my sister and I didn't know what to answer. However, we bluffed our way through, but behind me, talking as you do after the prayer meeting, were these young brothers and Alan Ker. And he was talking to these young boys and I'll quote him.

When, um, he was, he was demonstrating with his hand, which I won't do, "When you feel things rising, get home to your wife," he says to these young men. They weren't even married.

So you can see the filth was way, way back, way back. I mean, I was just horrified. I thought, for goodness sake, this is a prayer meeting and that's what you're saying. And these young lads, I mean, they didn't know what to do. They didn't know what to say. They're like, oh, they haven't a wife.

They haven't even got one. I mean, it really was, they were obsessed. It was...

Anyway, oh, and then in the June of that meeting, Alan Ker said that the Lord had appeared to us all by way of Bruce Hales, Jim Symington, and Jim Taylor, a bodily appearance of the Lord in all those three men. Can you imagine?

So I mean, well, when I look back, it's just awful. It's no wonder my husband can't stand it. It's just awful. Um, so then I was asked to go to a three-day meeting in Dartford. By this time, I'm the only girl at home and obviously, I presume it was a matchmaking thing. I don't know, was it? This is '68, '69. '69, yeah. Um, and [yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2663s), my sister got married, so I had to go to this jolly meeting when I didn't want to. And I was put in a box room, my bed was in a box room, you know, and people I didn't know, I didn't agree with it anyway. So I hated that weekend, absolutely hated it.

But, um, I had to put up with it. So what I didn't tell my family was on the way home, I came home early on the Sunday, never told my mum and dad, and I called in at the Royal Albert Hall and went to a concert there. And it was [absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2693s) wonderful. And I sat there with tears rolling down my face at this marvelous, marvelous music that we had been denied all those years. You couldn't, you know, you weren't allowed to listen to it. It was just incredible.

I remember sitting up on the balcony and the steward in charge of the seats, you know, came up and said, "What's a young lady like you doing on your own here?" And I thought, yeah, I mean, I was, you know, this is completely strange, but what a wonderful thing. I never let on. I thought, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2724s) is what it's about outside. What's wrong with this music? You know, there's nothing wrong with it. But of course, you weren't allowed to listen, were you? So, sorry, what month was that? This was in the...

What did I say? Do you know? After June. Yeah. 

**Ross Turner**

No, I was just wondering whether, you know, just thinking about it, would have been part of the BBC Proms? Do you think it could actually, it could have been. 

**Drue Wiggins**

You're right. It could have been from June to September, I think.Yeah, it could well have been, actually. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2759s)

You are, you not scared doing that?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2765s)

Um, well, it's exciting, wasn't it? Really. I mean, I think...

I parked my car near the Albert Hall. I mean, you'd never get near it today.

I mean, I was mad really, but now I'm a bit like that really. Why not? Yeah. But yeah, it was Dvořák's 9th and it was just wonderful. And I've never forgotten that night. Super. But of course, I couldn't tell mum and dad, could I? Anyway, all this time, of course, let's not forget Alan and Madeline have been going to and fro from New York. Alan used to go to New York on business. And of course, Madeline went with him many times because Jim wanted her there.

And yeah, so Alan started to take meetings and it was all very silly and nothing concrete spiritually at all.

So then we come to 1970\. I mean, you can go back on stuff, but 1970, he was in Cleveland. He took meetings in Cleveland, USA, and then that was when we had to have a hair let down because the scriptures of Mary washing the feet of Jesus and wiping him with her hair. So we had to let our hair down. Well, I just thought this was absolutely hilarious, really. I was staying along with two cousins with my sister who was now married to, I don't know if anyone knew, Leonard Baker, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2851s) ministering brother from Gaydon. I don't know if anyone knows of him. Well, my sister married his son, for better or worse, I have to say.

And so I was staying with her at Stratford-on-Avon and this ministry came out. While my sister, being very obedient, "Oh, you must, you must, you know, let our hair down." Well, of course, we still had hats in those days. So of course, she goes off to the hairdresser to get her hair suitably trimmed so as to wear her nice hat on top. My cousin and I, well, we were stuck. Well, we didn't let our hair down. We sat at that fellowship meeting and we didn't let it down. Well, we had absolute hoots with these sisters coming in with these hats [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2892s) top of her head with all the hair down her back. I mean, it really was hilarious and we were told off for laughing. Absolutely mad, which of course is why the scarves came in later on because it looked so daft anyway. So that's…

**Abi**

The scarves also look daft. They what? The scarves look daft too. Like, I've shown you some of my friends now what I had to wear to the meeting. They were like, "What is that?" I know. And they're getting more and more stupid by the day because [sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2923s) are putting like this thick wadding underneath because they're all high-end designer scarves now. They want to show off as much… Oh, you have the name at the back. Yes, yes. And they're out here.

You look like a bloody windsock.

**Drue Wiggins**

But just going back on that, why was he so obsessed with what women wore? Well, you know why?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2950s)

That's exactly what I was thinking, Drue. And I was also wondering again, the change from hats to headscarves, what was the official reason, if any, given for that?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2962s)

No, I think it was because all we sisters were sort of vying with each other for model hats and model this. So you're being...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2970s)

...pretentious with your hats?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2971s)

Yes, and then of course we're pretentious with our scarves with the name at the bottom of the silk scarf.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2975s)

Do you think there could be any chance it was your big white hat in Edinburgh that did it, Drue? Yeah, that changed things.

**Drue Wiggins**

That was the turning point and we all had to wear headscarves from then on in. Oh, I'm sorry about that.

**Jacky Har**t

You see, Big Jim spotted your hat and that was it. Sorry, carry on.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=2996s)

You have to laugh. Yeah. But the night coming back from that fellowship meeting, my cousin and I were just in bits about it all. So I rather naughtily said to my sister and her husband, "The man is mad. Jim Taylor's mad."

Well, that was it. I was escorted out of the house.

"Leave my house. You don't talk about Mr. Taylor like that."

So I said to my cousin, "What am I going to do?" Because my parents were away anyway. And so she said, "We'll come back with us." So I went to their house for the weekend. So my sister kicked me out for saying that Jim Taylor was mad. That was nice, wasn't it?

However, so yeah, so we left. But he was then in the June, the scarves come in, hats are out and scarves are in.

Then it wasn't long after that, that Jim Taylor was at a meeting near London. And my aunts were there. And my spinster aunt rang us up and told us that Mr. Taylor had got the sisters lined up to kiss him and sit on his lap. He also felt them down over their chests. And one poor lady who was a bit small-chested remarked she hadn't got any breasts, what's the matter with her? And this was in public.

And that's a spinster aunt telling me this. And she was, you know, you can imagine how awful these women felt. And the silly women queued up to go and sit on his lap and get felt.

[**Abi**](https://youtu.be/uU1qnQumLOk?t=3095)

Were there any children?

**Drue Wiggins**

No, this is an evening meeting. Oh, did children not go to them? No, not really. No.

**Abi**

Was there any reportable instances of him being like this for children or was it just women?

**Drue Wiggins**

Only as far as I know, only the women. Yeah.

I mean, things were so hot enough, it was just ghastly. Um, so yeah, that that was before the, um, the Aberdeen business. Anyway, on July the 6th, bear in mind this is the Aberdeen time, July 6th, Jim Taylor was in Harrow for the prayer meeting. And after the prayer meeting, he was staying with Alan and Madeline, of course. After prayer meeting, lots of local brethren were asked around to supper to meet Mr. Taylor. And my parents were [asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3145s) and I was asked to go and play the organ to entertain them all.

So I played this Hammond organ inside the house, but the Leslie speaker, which they had in those days, was out in the garden. So I'm playing away and all these people were sitting outside. They didn't have glasses, they had bottles of whiskey to drink. There were no glasses, and there were crates out on the lawn.

So there they were, no glasses, and they were drinking. My parents hated whiskey completely, but they had to obviously sip a bit.

So it was, of course, by the test of fellowship to drink whiskey. And if you had someone to stay, you had a new bottle of whiskey by the bed. And in the morning you would see whether they'd drunk it or not, because it was a test of fellowship. So of course, people probably put it down the sink. You don't know if they didn't, you know, if they didn't drink it, it was a test of fellowship that you had to drink whiskey. So this is back at Alan's house in the garden. And so I'm playing hymns [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3208s) heaven knows what, I don't know, I played. I was very glad I was in there.

Jim Taylor's out in the garden and all of a sudden this young 10-year-old girl came rushing into me. 

"Drue, I don't know what to do. I'm scared."

 "What's the matter?" 

She said,

 "Mr. Taylor is getting all the women to sit on his lap and kiss them."

 So she ran in. So I just couldn't believe it. So I said, 

"Look, you sit on the organ stool with me and make out you're moving and, you know, turning the pages of the music,"

Which she did. And then sometime later, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3238s) playing in the hall and the stairway is in front of me, and, um, Jim and Madeline went up to bed and they didn't come back. So it wasn't long before the party disintegrated and that was that. So that was in Alan Ker's house.

So then on the 7th of July, the next day, it was the ministry meeting and Madeline let down her hair and she went and washed Jim's feet in the middle of the meeting room and then wiped it with her hair. We all had to watch.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3271s)

Now, I actually remember hearing that story as a child, but I remember being told that what a wonderful thing it was that Madeline was washing, Madeline Ker was washing beloved Mr. Jim's feet in the way that Mary washed the feet of Jesus. And that's when I was a child.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3291s)

And following on from that, I remember my mum telling me the story that she was somewhere and literally there was a circle of brothers and the sisters had to go around washing each of the brothers' feet.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3307s)

Yeah, I remember, I remember my mom talking about it and I remember how awful it was. They literally had to, yeah, they had to do that and again, like a test of fellowship.

### **Abi**

Fungal toenails, athlete's foot, like just, no guys.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3329s)

Never mind anything else.

[**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3332s)

Yeah, exactly. But John, whoever it was, J.TJr., he's putting himself on the same level as Christ, actually, by comparing himself.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3345s)

So does Bruce Hales.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3348s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3350s)

No different. No.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3362s)

I don't know if anyone knew a man called Louis Vos, but I think he was at Netherlands or something. Anyway, just before Aberdeen, he was in Harrow and all he talked about was breasts and wombs and sex. And I mean, it was just absolute filth the whole time. And then, then they pray at the end. So then we come to the Aberdeen meetings. I was staying with mum and dad with some friends in Edinburgh. I mean, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3393s) was by the by, you know, we happened to be up there.

And we received a call to go back home for this special meeting in Harrow on the Tuesday. So we went down on the Monday. And all the way home, I can remember my mother saying, coming down the A1, "It's about time Alan Ker caught it. You know, it's about time he was knocked off his pedestal." All we knew was there was trouble with Alan Ker. When we got to the meeting, of course, we were told what the rumors were. And there were [questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3423s) and statements from brethren and people saying they didn't believe it. And some said, "Oh, what about it?" and "Can we have the facts?" And it went on and on. It really was very serious.

And Hubert Kingston quoted the Ethiopian woman with Moses. It's to say it was okay. Alan Ker quoted 1 Corinthians 9\. He said it was okay to take around a sister as wife. And that Mr. Jim had a right to do things that no one else had a right to do.

And it was just ghastly. I could not believe that they could believe this stuff. So they were questioned a lot and then they kept on about the priests' lips keeping knowledge and people who wanted to know the facts. You shouldn't ask, they should just trust, you know, that it's all okay and everything's fine.

Some charged him with corruption. Some confessed to hearing false stories, because they weren't false.

It just threw the whole Harrow meeting into disarray. It was just horrendous.

But Alan Ker told us that it was okay to read between the lines of scripture. So it didn't matter that scripture said you mustn't do this. You read between the lines of whatever.

Someone else said it was wrong for another man's wife to minister to Jim and called for the facts. So he was told to get out. So he went. He walked out. Slammed the door and went. It just went on and on and on. Querying. But they covered it. They tried to cover it and they tried to cover it the whole time.

Then, of course, they were asked... Alan and Arthur Lyon were one of the main ones. They went round the room and were saying, "Well, you were 100% with Mr. Taylor." This is all the brothers. And my poor old dad was sitting down at the front there, he said, "Well, yes," because you were so scared. And he wasn't. I knew he wasn't.

Later on at another meeting that week, because we had them every night, every night that week, they asked my father if he would give my mother to Mr. Taylor if Mr. Taylor wanted her.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3549s)

I remember hearing that rumor, but it actually happened. You were there and you heard it. Yeah, you actually heard that.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3555s)

My mother and I sitting up the back and she nudged me and, and she said, "Not likely," you know. I mean, fancy asking\! Fancy asking\! It was despicable. And that's, this this wasn't in a private house, this was in a meeting. This is in the big Harrow meeting room, the district. I remember it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely mortifying. Yeah. And were there [big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3585s) walkouts in that meeting or... 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3588s)

Yeah, lots of people were leaving. Lots of people. And I think too, when some people, I mean, you would remember the time, Drue, but when some people left around that time, they weren't leaving because they thought the position was wrong. They were leaving because of Mr. Jim Taylor's behavior. And we heard that podcast with Paul Flowerdew, didn't we, where his parents left and joined the Rentons. So it wasn't that they thought the principles of the Brethren and [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3618s) they believed in and the way they lived their lives was wrong. They were actually, it was that one person. So that's how, you know, he was explaining that's how the Rentons and the Open Brethren started up because people still wanted that Brethren community, didn't they, some people who left around that time?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3635s)

Yes, they carried on, yeah, they carried on as meetings. Yes. But then they all fell out. If you look, they're actually carrying on what J.N.D. set out to do in the first place, really, which is no hierarchy. Yeah, yeah.

Yes, it was sad.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3659s)

It was very sad. So the Harrow meeting at that time, it was the summer of '70, wasn't it? The summertime? Yeah, that must have been a complete turmoil, particularly of all the meetings in the UK.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3675s)

Yeah, because of Alan and Madeline being there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they were fêted as superstars. They were absolute superstars, Alan and Madeline. They could do no wrong. They were on a pedestal. Madeline wore black from head to toe, black headscarf, black dresses right down. I can see her now walking down the steps in the hall. She was told, they said that she was the purest lady in the land and we all had to look after her. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3704s)

I can remember, um, Alan and Madeline Ker coming, I was at the Luton meeting, which wasn't so far from Harrow, and I can remember them coming to the Luton meeting. It probably would have been after Aberdeen because I have no recollection of Aberdeen, but shortly afterwards. And it was like a hushed whisper. The Kers were coming and Alan Ker came and preached in Luton. And it was like this, you know, it was something to be revered. I had no idea what had happened just a short while previously.

No idea. So you're right. I think they were somehow treated as...

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3739s)

Oh, they were. They were fêted. He took meetings all over the place after that. For a short while.

**Ross Turner**

Even up to ten years ago, whenever they went anywhere for a break, they were still spreading the lies.

They were telling the story from basically their point of view and obviously it was their version.

My parents went to a break with them and they were really overawed that Alan and Madeline were there and they got to hear all about Aberdeen firsthand sort of thing. And I was just thinking to myself, "You utter, utter twits. How, how can you be taken in by it?" Because I was still in, obviously.  Yeah, so I don't know if they've passed now, but you know, as I say, up until 10 years ago, they were still, still spreading the lies. 

**Drue Wiggins**

Yes. Oh, they were definitely, you know, top of the tree, so to speak. But it wasn't for long. But obviously, they went back up the tree because they were actually thrown out, um, withdrawn from in the Christmas of '70. And they were withdrawn from on January the 1st, 1971\. Not [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3818s) long. Not for long, because obviously they came back in. But I, I don't know about the, when they came back.

But it really was the pits. There was no question about it. Absolute pits.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3831s)

I'm just sort of thinking while you're talking, if everybody had believed the truth back then and the whole thing had fallen apart, how would a lot of people cope? Like those older people that have been, you know, I think about it now, if something like this happens again, I can't, I know I've said it before, but I just can't imagine how my parents at 85 would cope with the fact that it's all been a lie.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3862s)

But I think that's probably why back in that time, we did end up with the Renton brethren and the Open Brethren and so on. Because people who had given their lives to it and wholeheartedly believed in it, it would be cruel to say to them, "You know what you've believed in is a lie." So they kind of gravitate to something that is going to bring them that comfort factor, but the bit that was wrong is gone. In other words, you know, they, as they [set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3892s) up the Renton brethren, it's very, very similar, but there isn't that Big Jim there. That that's, yeah.

And I, I wonder, and to go back to what you're saying, I don't know, it's speculative, isn't it? If something like that happened now, if a big scandal came out about the leader, I wouldn't be surprised if a similar thing happened. And in a way, that wouldn't be wrong because I think there would be people who couldn't cope with the transition to what we we now know [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3923s) freedom and normal life. Um, I think that would happen up to a point that they, people would continue having their meetings, they would continue having their version of the breaking of bread because that's their, their community, that's their comfort, that's their belief. No.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3938s)

It's true. They all gravitated to a sort of Brethren group. Yeah. You had the Rentons, you had the Frosties, you'd have three as well. Yes. Yeah. You previous to that, the Leamington one, which is the Leamington Spa, Coventry group. Um, yeah, all these little groups. But yes, they carried on what I just called "played meetings." They carried on playing meetings, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3964s)

I used to do that when I was three, Drue. Yeah, we did sit on the stairs and play meetings with my dolly. Anyway, carry on.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3974s)

My older sister, she was always the preacher and I had to be in the congregation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3981s)

Well, I had two older brothers, so I was always in the congregation. Anyway, we digress.

### **Abi**

Jackie, what you said about there being another Aberdeen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3993s)

Yeah.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=3994s)

Bruce Hales has said in ministry that there won't be another Aberdeen. There won't be, there won't be another Aberdeen. There'll be more, there'll be more crises, but there won't be another Aberdeen.

[**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4018s)

 We can't get much worse, can you?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4021s)

There's a lot of answers to that one, but I probably shouldn't say them on the podcast. It'll just be something very similar, but slightly different.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4023s)

I agree. Absolutely. It would be on the same lines. Who is he to say that there won't be another Aberdeen? He doesn't know that. He's only got to say something that a lot of people can't believe in.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4034s)

Maybe he's just thinking he hasn't found his Madeline yet.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4042s)

You know the picture that was in the People and the News of the World with Jim with his hand around Madeline? She wore that dress till it dropped off her. I recognize that dress all the time. Really? Because she was very tiny, very petite. Yes. And of course, Alan was some great big strapping gentleman. He was very tall, wasn't he? Yes. Extrardinarily tall, yes. Yeah. Anyway, so after that, of course, in Harrow, it got even sillier, not so much on the sex side, but then we had the [dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4072s) throwing, the paper dart throwing across the meeting rooms. We had toilet rolls being thrown across the meeting rooms.

Lots of filth. Yeah, it was all, Hubert Kingston used to say, "The world thinks we're, you know, we're tied here, but we're free, we're free," and chuck a toilet roll. You know, it was absolute rubbish. It was mad.

And then Charlie Hammond, he took a meeting and absolute filth about his wife. I mean, it just went on and on. Anyway, from my personal point of view, I'd switched off by then.

But my parents had, um, with their house, a loan off a sister to pay because of course you didn't have mortgages. So we had a loan from this sister. Well, this sister went and left the meeting, didn't she? So of course, the money in our house was dirty money. So what were we to do? Well, my parents had no money really at all. My father didn't earn much at all. And, um, so we had to pay off this loan to stay in Harrow. Well, where [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4136s) we go to get this money from someone who was still in fellowship?

So my father went cap in hand, I handed it to him, he had guts. He went cap in hand to Arthur Lyon and said, "Could you lend me the money?" So we had to try and get, so he went to Arthur Lyon and said, "Well, could you lend us?" And I mean, this sounds daft now in today's world, but it was £2,000, that's all we needed. But it was like the equivalent of 30 grand to finish off this payment. So we were stuck as a family, this is mum, dad and me, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4166s) had to move somewhere to a cheaper house, a cheaper area. But of course, you're not allowed to move localities. So where do we go? Get a caravan? I mean, what do we do?

So they had this, the Satchwell case, my surname, came up every week on a Tuesday night. "Now then, what's happening with your house? What are you doing about it?" We didn't know where to go for the money. I mean, talk about humiliating. It was dreadful. So that's the way they treated you. It was absolutely despicable. So [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4196s) the end, after lots of arguments and lots of heartache, we actually had to move and we went to Brackley. Why I went there I don't know. That's my parents' choice.

So, and of course, we got a much cheaper house and we paid off this jolly loan. So there's me moving with my parents. By this time, I'm 26, a grown woman. I've had to change two jobs already to please the Brethren. So there I am with mum and dad and I moved to this one-horse town [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4227s) it was then, no streetlights, no nothing, no young people in the meeting.

And it was the Banbury meeting, Brackley and Banbury meeting. And I stuck it for six weeks.

And I just couldn't take it anymore. I mean, this was just the death of me because either I had to marry a Brethren man who'd be very hot in it, and that was risky, um, or I stay single and work for Brethren in an office, which I don't do. By then, I was in selling, you see. I was already in sales and I was traveling around. Oh, and when I used to travel down to Kent and Brighton, I used to stay with Brethren. And this really got to me. I'd stay [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4271s) Brethren because obviously you couldn't go to a hotel. And I'd go to the meetings with the Brethren and it was fine. I didn't have any problem with it. But then the Brethren decided, they got on to my father, "She needs to be home every night at the local meeting."

So this went on and on. And in the end, my father said to me one Friday night, "If you don't keep the rules and you come home every night, you'll have to go."

And that was the Friday night. So on the Saturday, we went to the Bible, so-called Bible reading at Banbury. And there was Lancelot Railton, who was the man, the main man there. And I'm sitting there, by this time actually I'm on drugs, I'm on lithium.

And because I was too depressed with it all. So I'm sitting there like a zombie in this meeting, I can see it now, and I could hear him say amongst the mist, "We don't want any passengers, we don't want any passengers." I thought, "You know, you don't, you're absolutely right, you don't. You don't need any passengers and I'm one." So we went home, we had lunch, my mum and dad went out for a ride in the afternoon, so I picked up the phone and ran my sister who had left, been chucked out [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4345s) the April, and I rang up and said, "You want a lodger?"

Packed up my car with everything I could think of and went. And I just left a note on the fridge for my mother, not my father, because my father told me to go. So that was that. So I stayed with my sister for about six weeks and then she had to move from their house. So, um, it was a question of finding somewhere. So I got a bedsit in Bedford, £7 a week, would you believe? It's very damp, very nasty, but I kicked [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4375s) there and that was it. That was me out. Wonderful. I cried for about two days, but tearful a bit. And after that, I thought, "What are you crying for? You're free." So I left and that was it.

**Ross Turner**

And how did you cope with, um, not having any closure, like leaving your mum, um, because obviously you left while they were... I mean, I did the same. I left when they were out of the house. How did you cope with that in later years?

**Drue Wiggins**

I've always said they made their choice, I made mine. I didn't want... I mean, I knew it would break her heart, I'm sure it did. And I left a note to her particularly and said, "I just think it's best for all of us," because I didn't agree with any of it. And she knew I didn't. And they didn't agree, but they were too scared to leave, far too scared to leave. So I just said, "It's best for all of us." I've seen her twice since then. That was it. Then she died. So, um, yeah, that's the way I, I deal with it. They chose and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4436s) chose.

And yeah, I mean, she was very good. I'm sure it must have broken her heart because eventually I was in this bedsitter, but then I managed to get made redundant three weeks later, would you believe? So anyway, I managed to get myself another job. I walked the streets and got myself another job. And, um, that turned out to be a very good one. And they moved me to Cheltenham as a sales rep. And so I did well there. And then I was [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4467s) this bedsitter for about, a nice, nice flat actually, about £10 a week. It sounds mad now, doesn't it, rental?

And then I thought, "That's a waste of money. So I'm going to get a house. I'm going to buy a house." And the company I was with, they were absolutely wonderful and they upped my wages so I could get a mortgage. I mean, there was talk about God looking after me when I left. It was just incredible. And so I got this maisonette in Gloucester [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4497s) I lived there. Now, my mother, I always, I always sent letters to them where I was, what I was doing, never anything back. But then one day, my mother answered with a bit of paper and she said, "There's a van coming to your house on whatever it was."

And it's just from us with our love. And there were two single beds in there, but all the beds in there came from home. And there were all sorts of bits from home that she said, "We don't need it now. We don't need it." How my father got to, I mean, how he let her do it, I don't know. I'm really, you know, anyway, so that was very kind. So it just showed her heart was there, but they had to stay, didn't they? They had to stay.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4537s)

You know, that's what's so wrong. Why, you know, you talk about making a choice, there shouldn't, yeah, there shouldn't be the need for that choice. No, no, no, no, no. A daughter should, to live a life free, shouldn't have to choose.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4553s)

No, but yeah, it was sad. I mean, it used to get to me, but you know, what can you do?

I don't think they would ever have coped if they'd come out, wouldn't have coped. I just don't think they could cope. So it's better that they were there, really. When my father died, I got a slip of paper, the back of an envelope, the three-corner bit at the back of the envelope that you stick down, and that was in the envelope and mum has written on it, "Dad went to be with the Lord, December the 6th, 1985." That was it.

That's all I got. So that was that. I've since found out where he's buried, etc. That was him. And then of course, she was left on her own, so she couldn't live on her own because she's not allowed to. So she was put from pillar to post and pillar to post. And it went for years, actually. So from '85 to 2000\.

I didn't know where she was at all, not a clue. And I suddenly get urges about finding her. And I go to electoral rolls. This is all before internet stuff, but where it's all there. And searching around, going to libraries, thinking, "Where else could she be put?" And bit by bit, you sort of thought, "Well, maybe she could be this town, that town, whatever." You just didn't know where your own mother was. It was awful. So anyway, when it got to the year 2000, I was, and again, I'm going to try and find her, you know, must find her sort of thing.

So I went on the libraries and the electoral rolls and various things. And then I suddenly realised I've got a cousin still in, who still is in, in Manchester. So I thought, well, maybe she's living with them. So I went to the Yellow Pages and looked up, um, just in case, nursing her, or doctor surgeries first of all. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4670s) then, um, I'd ring up the practice manager and they were so rude, some of these people. "Don't you know where your mother is? What's her name?" Oh, they were so rude. Anyway, one, one person said, um, "Yes, she's on our books." She's got the same name as me. She was Drusilla as well. "She's on our books." So I said, "Could you tell me the doctor?" So she said, "Yes." I said, "Would you make an appointment for me with her doctor?"

So she did. So I roused myself, got myself going over there. And I went to see this doctor, this very posh clinician.

And I gave him a picture of my mother as I last knew her. And because my name's the same as hers, I'm trying to prove who I was. And so he said, "Yes." So I said, "Can you tell me how she is?" "Well, she's very poorly, very poorly." So I said, "Can she tell me where she is?" "No, I can't. It's confidential. Can't tell you." So I put the picture to him and she said, "No, I can't tell you. All I can say is it's a very nice home. She's in a nursing [home."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4743s)

So I thought, well, that figures because that's the biggest advert in the Yellow Pages is the one she's in. It'll be the most expensive one because I've tried a lot of others. And sure enough, so I went to found this nursing home. By the time I got there, I was in bits, you can imagine, tears pouring down my face. And I thought, well, I can't go in. I parked up outside and I thought, I can't just go in with streaming tears down, you know, to this the staff. They'll think, "What's this [woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4774s) doing walking in here crying?" They don't know who I am. And then if my cousins were in visiting my mother, they wouldn't let me in the door. And then if my mother saw me, she might have a heart attack and die. What do I do?

So I sat outside wiping my eyes and blowing my nose and I thought, I'll go home and I'll get her one of the Instamatic cameras that were in then. I'll get one of those and I'll send it to the home, explain the situation. "Can you take a picture [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4804s) her?" because it was a week before her birthday, her 90th birthday. So I did that and that arrived, that was on the Friday, so I arrived at the home on the Tuesday morning. She died Monday night.

So I missed it.

I missed her. Having said that, looking back, it was probably better because if I'd have felt I was perhaps the cause of her death with the shock of it. So that was on the Monday night. So on the Tuesday, my cousin from Manchester, I hadn't spoken to him since I left, which was, of course, years ago. And he said, "Oh, just to tell you, your mother's gone to be with the Lord." So I said, "Well, thank you very much for telling me." He didn't let on. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4852s) he said, "She's been in a very nice nursing home." I said, "Oh, yes, I know that." Of course, I'd only just heard a few hours before. He doesn't know that, of course.

So he said, "The funeral will be, the burial will be at the Cheltenham Cemetery and it'll be at 9:30 on Thursday morning. And if you go, we would like you to stand 20 metres away from the grave."

So I thought, keep your patience, don't say anything. So, "Thank you ever so much for letting us know." And came off the phone and told Peter and he said, "That's wrong. Oh no, it's your mother. You should be at the graveside." You know, so I said, "Well, you ring him back because you're not an ex-Brethren, you're less of a sinner than I am." So he rang him and he said, "No, I'm sorry, Martin. This is Drue's mum and we're going to stand at the graveside and for a few minutes and we'll see the coffin put in [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4911s) then we'll walk away."

So that's what we did. My sister came up on the National Express from London and so we got up and we went along to the funeral. So we saw where the grave was and so we parked up about back a bit and then along came this estate car. Men in their woolly cardigans pulled the coffin out of the back of the car and they took it to the grave and they lowered it into the grave. And the other brethren all sort [of,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4941s) they just walked by us apart from two sisters who smiled at me because I was determined to smile at them. They smiled back, but the others looked as miserable as anything. And they went and they scuttled to the other side of the grave as if we were lepers.

So we stood at the foot and held hands for a few minutes and sort of tweaked each other's hands. "Right, we better go now." And then we walked away and then they did whatever they did. That was it. So we went to the nursing home after that and the nurses didn't know, the staff didn't know [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=4971s) she had any daughters. They didn't know of our existence at all.

So, but they were very kind. They took us to the room where she had been. And when I think back, she was right by the front door. She could have seen me walking in that day. I mean, whether she'd recognised me, of course, I don't know. But yeah, so they took us and they gave us the picture of her as she was in the home. And so we've got that. And that was it, basically.

It's absolutely wicked, but as I say, you know, she made her choice. Um, what can you do about it? She was too scared to leave. Anyway, when it came to the will, which was choice, it was all typewritten and then she'd done this wonky signature at the bottom of it. And we were sent a copy of it. And all the money went to, not that she had much, went to the relatives that are still in. But my cousin did send her wedding ring, her engagement [ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5030s) to us. And that's what we had, basically. It's actually the most precious, really, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Very sad though, very sad. They did the exact same with my gran, um, because my dad had a brother that left and they got her to to divide the money between us three boys so that he wouldn't get anything at all.

It's absolutely wicked, it really is.

Oh, it is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5059s)

Drue, what was it that made you go looking for your mother then?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5065s)

I don't know. I've had these urges as I call them before. And then I sort of sit back and think, well, you know, that's what she wants. You know, you can't do anything about it. I don't know. I don't know what prompted me, but it was amazing, yeah, amazing the way it worked.

Um, but you know, I saw her in a sense. I got as near as I could. Um, but yeah, it's just sad because we three girls could have looked after her. Yeah, we could have taken it in turns and seen her well looked after and fed. She had a miserable life going from pillar to post in Brethren she didn't know really or didn't want to be in their houses.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5109s)

I might have misunderstood the story, but did you and your sisters leave, both of them or just one of them?

**Drue Wiggins**

 No, all of us are out now. 

**Jacky Hart**

All of us, all of you left. So she was very much, gosh, on her own.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5121s)

Well, yes, that's another story because my middle sister is the one that married Leonard Baker's son, and they left in the April of '72. I left in July '72. My oldest sister stayed in.

So eventually she looked after my mother and father. They had an annex and they looked like a granny flat and they looked after them. And they're very good to them. But then my sister's family and the lads apparently got up to tricks. I don't really know the story. I'm not going to put it on air. I don't know really what. But anyway, my sister and her husband eventually were thrown out. Right. They decided to go. 

And so the the Brethren came along and they kidnapped my parents from my sister's [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5166s). They literally bundled them into a car and my sister suddenly saw this car and mum and dad getting in and she tried to follow the car but lost it to find where they'd gone. And they didn't know for weeks where my mother and father had been kidnapped to. 

**Jacky Hart**

What year would have that be? That would be '85, '85. Um, no, no, no, no, no, yes, it would be '85. Yeah, yeah. Yes, I think it is '85.

**Abi**

But it's criminal. It's actually criminal. They literally just took…

**Drue Wiggins**

So she was absolutely, you know, devastated. I mean, they got them housed and looking after them. My father had had a very bad stroke. He didn't know what time of day it was, but they bundled him into a car and took him away. So then they had to stay with other brethren and my mother would have hated it, absolutely hated it. Um, so yeah…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5222s)

Oh, it's just wicked. And over the years when you were not in the Brethren, when you did know where your parents lived, obviously before your father passed away, did you write to them or try and contact them or did you feel you couldn't?

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5239s)

No, I couldn't really. No. No, I mean, for a start with my eldest sister where they lived, I didn't really know that. I didn't know much about that at all. So, no, I lost touch with a lot of it, to be honest.

So I learnt a lot afterwards. No, it's just so sad for old people trying to be faithful to the Lord, as I would say. Yes. And yet they're actually stuck in that system. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5272s)

Yeah. And there would be no reason, to most people who don't understand how the Brethren operate, there would be no reason for your mother not to have contact with her three daughters just because they don't go to her church, which is the bottom line of what it was, wasn't it? And, and that's what's so criminal about it, as we say all along quite often in these podcasts, is what they do to families. And they have this quote, and I, [i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5302s) read it once very recently, actually, I remember, and something I was reading this week, um, "It's not the Brethren that break up families, it's sin that breaks up the families." And they honestly believe that. And then you want to say, well, if you like, for you, Drue, what was the sin you committed apart from packing your car up and saying, "I don't want to go to this church." You know, it was...

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5328s)

Apparently, the official line of why I left was I had a tape recorder. That's what they said. Okay. It's funny because later I met someone who was actually at that meeting and he said, "I felt awful because I had a radio under my bed."

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the official line was that really she's not, you know, good enough. But I actually took the bull by the horns and went. 

**Abi**

You took that decision. They twisted it. Yeah. Well, I've got a recording of our meeting, both meetings were being shut up and withdrawn from, and actually no reason was given.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5365s)

No.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5366s)

So all the Brethren have just manufactured their own story of what, why we've left. In my opinion, your, your children are far less likely to be sexually abused out here than they are in there because you're surrounded by paedophiles in there and you don't have a choice.

Out here, you're, from my perspective, I don't know if other people would agree, um, but if someone is showing red flags, you cut contact immediately and you take your children as far away as possible from, from, from potential harm. But in there, you can't do that. I mean, even our local, we have, we had a pedophile who, um, who I raised concerns about, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5423s) um, I was called around to a priest's house and sort of, you know, "What are you doing talking about this? It's been over 40 years ago and the Brethren have forgiven him. Why are you talking about it?" And I actually had no idea that anything had happened 40 years ago. I was looking at this man, noticing his vile behaviors towards children, and that's what I was picking up on.

And then they quoted the scripture saying, um, "If you won't forgive another their sins, then God will not forgive you for that."

Is that how you are forgiving the paedophile? Just by saying that, you're putting his, it felt like they were putting his blame on, what should have been his blame, onto me.

Very clever.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5480s)

It is, it's mental manipulation, isn't it?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5483s)

Well, it's another form of abuse, really. And especially considering what I've been through, I recognise the signs. I wish I, in one way, I wish sometimes that I couldn't because I see it's that I saw it so often in there that, you know, I could have kept the police very, very, very busy. And I'm still debating, you know, especially with this new law coming out in England, whereas if you know about a case, you know, you need to talk to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5513s) police about it. So let that be a warning to the parents of the children that I know about that have been abused.

Bloody report it fast before I do.

Yeah, because I know what I should be doing, but with the threats that I've had from those parents, it kind of terrifies you.

**Ross Turner**

Well, what you were saying, Drue, about you know, not knowing why you were withdrawn from, I can remember we had a brother local, he and his wife were withdrawn from, and at the time they weren't told why. And then they were restored back into fellowship, and again, they weren't told why they were withdrawn from. And he went to his grave never, ever knowing why. They were, they were never, ever told.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5577s)

That's sad, isn't it, really? Very sad. And after you left, Drue, did the Brethren ever try to contact you? I mean, did they? 

**Drue Wiggins**

No. Not at all. Not at all.

**Jacky Hart**

No, they knew you were a hopeless case. But they never tried to follow you or come and see you or... Yeah, because I mean, that that was actually my experience too. Once I said, "I don't want to be part of it," they never, and they never told me I was withdrawn from anything. I have, I, I have, well, I had no idea for about 25 years whether I'd actually been withdrawn from. I still haven't officially been told.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5619s)

I knew because I left on the Saturday and on the Tuesday morning, the phone rang at my sister's and it was Lancelot Railton wanted to speak to me. And he speaks with a very high voice and he said, "Oh, Drusilla, I want you to come to the meeting tonight, the ministry meeting. Um, we want to, you know, talk about you leaving, sort of thing. We need to do the necessary." So I thought, well, this is a joke. What's the necessary?

"Thank you for telling me." I didn't say I was going. I didn't go. That night about nine o'clock, the phone went again. "Oh, Drusilla, just tell you we've done the necessary." And that's all I know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5666s)

You have to "done the necessary." Yeah, well, at least they told you. I didn't even have that phone call.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5674s)

What does that even mean? "Done the necessary."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5679s)

It does really. One wonders what they said about you. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5685s)

I was withdrawn from a care meeting. My dad came home and said in a very hushed voice, "You've been withdrawn from," and I was like, "Yes\!" That's the thing that could have happened.

**Abi**

No. All this, all this stuff you've been going over, being a recent leaver, um, if we know insiders watching this, but some of the insiders that's still a bit on the fence, you don't, they don't really know what to believe. Um, because I was, I was in that position. I had no idea of what to believe and what not to believe. Um, and they, and Brethren are very, "Well, show me the proof." Um, and then you've got Bruce Hales saying that is a test. But then we hear your story and so, and since I've come out, so many [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5738s) people's stories about what truly happened, how would you encourage insiders to learn the real truth and not to just believe what Bruce Hales has, how he's tried to cover it up?

It's just put two and two together. Use your brain. You're sure, I mean, it's common sense. You don't lie beside a bloke in bed who's not your husband with no clothes on and be told you're just massaging his neck, because that's what we were told.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5774s)

I mean, I think for those that are inside, I think you've given a really valuable insight, Drue, because you were in Harrow and saw things that, I know you weren't at Aberdeen, but you saw things in that very odd relationship between Alan and Madeline Ker and J.TJr. that a lot of people wouldn't have been privy to have seen. So effectively, what you've given there is an eyewitness account of a lot of the background behavior that led [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5804s) to Aberdeen. It was brewing a long time before 1970, that behavior.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5809s)

Sorry, did anyone try to stop the behaviors that were going on or were they too scared to? 

Too scared. Too scared.

**Abi**

 Yeah, well, this is what I worry about with Bruce Hales.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5822s)

Well, it's just the exact same. Every "Man of God," as they call them, or "elect vessel," is the exact same. And while they're believing that, you're not going to change.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5833s)

Yeah. I mean, the biggest change people can make now is get the heck out of there because, you know, he's, he said, you know, "There's no safety in numbers and we're a minority" and this and that. But if he's got no one left, he's on his own. 

**Ross Turner**

I know while we've been talking, I've been thinking about what you said quite early on in the podcast about how Alan and Madeline were quite nasty to your parents.

And you said, you know, "Was it because they knew something?" Well, I, this is me just putting two and two together, would it have been because, um, Alan and Madeline had spoken to your parents about their intimacy issues, then were really nasty to your parents because your parents were privy to, so that's really confidential knowledge.

**Drue Wiggins**

Could well be. Could well be. I mean, it was just bizarre anyway to ask them around.It's just not normal.

My parents would not be therapists, for goodness sake. 

**Abi**

Yeah, exactly. Go to a sex therapist if you've got issues. Do you know what I mean?

**Drue Wiggins**

 I mean, that was used before. So that's the way their mind was working.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5910s)

It was just sick. Really was sick.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5913s)

I think it just shows the power of how when a narrative is given, if it's given forcefully enough, you can end up believing the lie, which I think is what happens. And I think that happens in, and particularly over Aberdeen. I think, I don't remember Aberdeen at all. I was, but I don't remember it. And I think the stories I heard about it as I was growing up, you know, the usual, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5943s) was a test of the faith and the brother was a pure man and it was something the Lord told him to do because it was to show who was true to him. I heard all those stories as I grew up. But then when you look at it back with adult eyes, you think, "No, he was just with another woman."

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5960s)

That's the bottom line. Yeah. That's the bottom…

**Abi**

Which, you know, whatever, we don't care, but just, just be honest. Yeah. Yeah. 

**Ross Turner**

Well, they say that if you tell a lie often enough, you'll end up believing it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=5973s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I, I think that's true. And you will end up believing it. And that, that lie can then become a person's truth. And I think sadly, that's possibly what's happened to a lot of people in the Brethren because actually to think anything else, yes, people would be devastating. It would be like you say about your parents, Drue. Even though they lost their three daughters, they still couldn't see, couldn't admit and see through the lie. And you can kind of get that in a way, [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6003s) you? 

**Drue Wiggins**

Um, it's a comfort thing, isn't it? Stay with what you know. Yes, because the jump out is too big. 

**Jacky Hart**

You know, yeah, it's just too scary. And I think that might be the case for a lot of people in the Brethren at the moment. Absolutely. What you want to say is, "It's okay." But yeah, and ultimately, they've got to make their own choices.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6023s)

Because their whole livelihoods have been formed for them. And when you come out here, you have to form your own livelihoods. And I think there's a lot of disgruntled older brethren at the moment because they're seeing exactly what's going on, but they're too scared to leave. But in leaving, they know that they'd lose their family, they'd lose their houses, they'd lose, I mean, some of them, there was a survey the other day that, that, you know, that over 70s is about 27.2 [million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6053s) pounds or dollars still owed on mortgages for people over 70\. So some of them would lose their jobs and that's really scary. And yeah, that people were seeing through it, but...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6068s)

...just, I mean, a lot, for, for a lot of people, it's easier not to see it.

### [**Drue Wiggins**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6073s)

Yes, definitely.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6075s)

Yeah, and I sort of understand that, but I do too.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6079s)

Well, I did it for years.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6081s)

But, but you know, for, I used to say to my, my dad, mom, when they were still talking to me, "It would be so much easier if I, if I didn't, if I could believe it all, but I can't." Yeah. All right. It's much easier.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6095s)

But it's an innate thing in us because I went through a really tough patch a few months ago and my first thought was to go back to the Brethren because it was where I knew and I knew that I'd be looked after and all the rest of it. Um, obviously I haven't, but, um, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6114s)

I couldn't go back, I couldn't go back because now I know the truth.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6122s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6122s)

But I understand people just shutting themselves off from even questioning anything because, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6131s)

Because to actually open that box is too, too difficult.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6135s)

It's just too difficult. I remember my mom saying that to me, you know, when I said that looking from the outside in, you can see the truth. And she said, "Why did you ever step outside?"

She didn't disagree, but it was, you know, she just wished that I'd never stepped out over that. I understand how they think.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6159s)

Yeah.

There's a man down south at the moment who is attempting to return to the Brethren. And I've heard the story of people very close to him and it's so sad how the Brethren found him, as you were saying, Ross, at a low point after his daughter had got married. And he found himself at this low point because he wasn't told that she got married, which [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6191s) wrong in itself. And then the Brethren have just absolutely obliterated this man's head, mental health, well-being, everything. And he's returning to a place where he left because, you know, he saw the truth. And if they get you at that low point...

I mean, I knew deep down that I wouldn't ever go back, but I think it's like your first instinct is to go back to what you know.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6224s)

And again, I don't even blame or judge people that do go back. I... because it's not easy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6235s)

No.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6236s)

It's not easy and if that's how people cope with it...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6240s)

Yeah. Well, Drue, thank you so much for sharing your story. I actually have found it absolutely fascinating because I remember the Kers from as a child and it's, it's been really interesting to hear the first-hand eyewitness of what you saw in that time. And thank you for keeping your diaries because that means it's, we know your dates are spot on, which is fantastic. And I think it will give people a really good, [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU1qnQumLOk&t=6270s) both non-Brethren and people inside watching and other leavers that are younger perhaps, give them an insight into how things changed and what happened. And actually the history of, I want to say destruction, has been going on for so long, so, so long.

So, yeah, we really appreciate your time this evening, Drue. Thank you very much. It's been fascinating.

Absolutely fascinating. And we will say goodbye and thank you, everybody.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
