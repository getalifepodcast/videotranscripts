### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Hello everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast. I'm Lane and I'm here today with Cheryl, Richard, Carman and our guest today is Peter Hart. We've got a long story that we're going to go through today and I think we're going to be pretty excited about this one. Peter, take it away.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=25s)

Okay, well, I'm 54 years old. I'm from Wellington in New Zealand, the coolest little capital in the world. And, yeah, I got married at 22\. My wife was 20\. That's what you did back then.

And, yeah, when I was about 30, I was about 35-ish when Bruce Hales came into power. And I was a good Brethren boy, I guess, and I had no doubts about the Brethren position. I was happy to follow the rules.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=74s)

So you were a good Plymouth Brethren Christian Church member. You believed in the doctrine?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=81s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I still believe in the core doctrine, if you like, the core teaching. I read quite a bit, especially in my late teens, but I mostly read the old ministries, like JND through to JT.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=101s)

Can you explain to the listeners who those people were and who...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=107s)

So ministry is written writings. So in the early days, John Nelson Darby, he's the founder of the church, and his ministry was mostly writings which he wrote in his room. He had a series of different writings. He had the synopsis of the Bible, which was five books where he explained the Bible teachings, and he had various other writings, notes and jottings, and discussions and apologetics, all sorts of different ones.

And then Mr. Raven was the next one after him and there again it was mostly lectures. And then James Taylor was the next one. They were all sort of solid mainstream, I guess you'd call it Christian teaching. And after that came JTJr. And that's where I sort of didn't really read much, it never really made much sense to me. And yeah, it just didn't make sense basically.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=183s)

Did you ever get the sense reading that stuff that they weren't truly educated in the bible?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=191s)

I wouldn't say that with the earlier ones. I think they were pretty well educated. I think the earlier ones, they did, they were pretty well educated, like they read the Greek and Hebrew words and they knew what they meant. I would say they were pretty well educated. But we can go into more of that later on. That's my own personal opinion and a lot of people disagree with me, I realise that.

But from JT Junior forward, I think it started a slippery slope into becoming pretty uneducated really.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=236s)

Yeah. What made you leave?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=241s)

So, well, we're jumping forward quite a bit. So, yeah, I was about 35 when Bruce Hales came into power, and I saw a real difference there. So before him was John Hales, his father, and his father was quite well taught in the ministry too. And, you know, up until then I had no doubts. But when Bruce Hales came to power, I could see a person who was quite unempathetic.

And I mean he said some things like, he went to a tailor to get his shirts made. He talked about himself a lot, you know, "I go to a tailor to get my shirts made," and I thought, "Well most of us can't afford to do that." You know, and he said, "Oh, I hate Australian jokes." And I thought, well, hey, the Australians are funny people. We all like laughing at the Australians. There's something wrong with a guy that can't laugh at himself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=303s)

Yeah, it's like your ego is very delicate or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=307s)

That's right, yeah. I mean, just to be fair about the shirts, I mean, the regular stores only go up to a certain size, don't they?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=316s)

Yeah, well, he was making a good point. He sort of had to go to a tailor or a tent shop, you know, an outdoor shop that sells tents.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=326s)

There's a scripture about dwelling in tents, isn't there?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=337s)

He struck me as a selfish sort of person who who liked himself. And he talked about money a lot, he was obviously, money means a lot. And then very soon he brought back the system days. I don't know if you've talked in the podcast a lot about system days, but that's what his father was involved in and his uncle back in the 60s, where they were very hot on Bible teaching, you know, it was a big thing, but also money making.

And it was at a time when JT Jr, who we talked about before, who was an alcoholic, which the Brethren of course hotly deny, but it was a time when he was in hospital drying out and the Hales brothers took over worldwide. Now Bruce Hales married JT Jr's daughter.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=402s)

That's Bruce Senior, just to be clear. Bruce Senior, that is. Yeah, uncle of the incumbent one. That's right. Okay.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=409s)

So he had married J.T. Jr.'s daughter, so he already sort of had a foothold in there, into the family. And they sort of took over universally and really pushed this, what was called the system days.

And when JTJr came out of hospital and was sober again, he jumped on it and took issue with it, which was a major blow to the Hales name. The Hales' name was sort of trashed at that point, which Bruce would have been in his teens, and he was really offended and hurt by this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=458s)

Oh, it's always that, it's always the little hurt one, right? It gets so mad. Sorry, go on.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=471s)

So when he came into power in the early 2000s, he brought back that whole thing. And he brought back, you know, we started having business meetings, not in the church meetings but outside of them. So the first one in New Zealand was in Whanganui.

And I went to it. I was working for my father at the time and Bruce was there and he was helping the Brethren how to run their businesses. And to be honest, the Brethren back then were pretty naive about business, especially in New Zealand. They didn't even know what their break-even was, for instance.

And these business meetings were quite helpful and I thought they were good, you know, helping bringing their basic needs, how to run a business. And I actually came away from that business and told my father I was going to leave his business and start my own business. Because there were four of us brothers in this business, which was a bit overcrowded, like we only had about eight staff. So it was a bit overcrowded and it was all mutual. And that's [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=548s) I started my own business.

And yeah, so that's when Bruce was starting to come in to bring back the system days, but it all sort of progressed from there. And then over the next few years, he really started to justify the system days and he started to say they should never have stopped. And of course, you can never talk against the previous leader, so he said JT Jr was misinformed, he was told wrong information.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=592s)

Oh, how clever, how clever, how clever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=595s)

Revisionism.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=597s)

Very slippery.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=598s)

Very slippery.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=599s)

Yeah, and both Bruce Hales and John Hales in those days were very arrogant. They were very hard on people and they used to talk about business in the church meetings too. And they used to stand people up in those meetings. This is what I've been told because I wasn't even born in the 60s, oh well I was born in '68, but they used to stand people up in the meetings and ask them what their income was. And they used to ridicule Brethren if their income was too low or if it was too high and they weren't giving enough away or... [Wow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=639s)

And those sort of things. So public shaming? Yeah, public shaming. And it used to continue in the houses.

But then Bruce Hales, you know, through the subsequent years as I was starting to see through him, he was saying that John Hales had never done anything wrong in those in the system days. His father did nothing wrong, he had nothing to repent about. And that's one of the questions I asked my priests, the people that visit me when I'm on my way out. I said, "How can you say that he had nothing to [repent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=682s) about?" And at one point they couldn't answer that. They said, "Oh," they had no answer, and they said, "I'll have to come back to you about that."

And they didn't tell that. Yeah. So they came back to me about that, and I've just got to think about what they said. Yeah, it all come back to me. But there was some sort of canned response that I was supposed to say to that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=710s)

So something about it was his excessive humility that, yeah, it was something along those lines, having done things that he hadn't really done.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=717s)

Bruce went so far apparently recently as to say that when his father, because his father was actually kicked out of the church, excommunicated, withdrawn from as they call it, he went so far as to say that actually it was the reverse and John Hales was actually withdrawing from everybody else in Sydney. Okay.

Like, that is... Anyway, I don't even know what to say about that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=746s)

Something like that was said where I was local. It was sort of put that, well, at that point, John Hales was the testimony and the Brethren were not in the testimony. Yes\! He was carrying everything forward and it was actually everyone else who was wrong.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=762s)

Which is mind-blowingly stupid.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=768s)

So there's been all sorts of spins put on it to justify it, but the fact is that John Hales did, he did strip Brethren wrongly. And yes, through the COVID times, of course, I was kicked out in August 2020\.

So prior to that we were listening to recordings in the COVID times, in lockdown, we were listening to recordings from the 60s. And I heard John Hales talking really rudely in a meeting to an older brother. He was telling him he needed to be a man and he was barking at him and just talking to him. You know, John Hales would have been, I worked out, he would have been about 42 and he was talking to a man in his 70s.

And that's one thing I said to the priests, I said, "He was rude, you know, in the 60s." And apparently they told Bruce Hales what I'd said. And Bruce Hales was just shocked I would say that about his father, he was rude. He was offended about that, but it was just, it's absolutely no doubt that they were a couple of young upstarts in the 60s.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=847s)

It's just another man, right? These are all like, I would believe that these were truly God's chosen individual leaders if they didn't per se pee or poo, if they didn't need to eat food, right? That would be, there you go, right? They're special, but they're not. These people put their pants on one leg at a time like everyone else. They were alcoholics, some of them. They were rude to people in church. They publicly shamed people for not making enough money. Oh, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=886s) sounds exactly like Jesus.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=893s)

Yeah, so I started to see holes, you know, Bruce Hales earlier on. When I was, yeah, about that time we were moving house. Our first home we'd outgrown it and we were moving to another part of the city. And it was a time in New Zealand where there was a what was called a leaky home syndrome. There was a bunch of new houses that hadn't been built properly, so we decided we'd like to build a home, which was frowned upon in the Brethren.

But I thought, "Well, maybe I could ask Bruce Hales if we could build a home." So I rang him up and I said, "Can we build a house?" And John Hales's ministry index hadn't been published at that time and I couldn't find it in his ministry. I'd heard that he said we shouldn't build houses. Brethren weren't doing it because it was hearsay. But I couldn't find it. I thought, "Oh, I'll ask Bruce."

I was a bit of a loose unit and so I rang Bruce and he said, "Well, we've been told," this is, you know, listen to this, what he said back then, "we'd be told we shouldn't build houses because, you know, we'll just build what we like to build and they'll be big and exactly what we want." And that's the reason. So he said, "I'm happy if you build a [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=994s), but just show the plans to two local brethren and keep it simple." That's basically what he said.

And so I got off the phone, we bought a section, I told my wife what he'd said. It was clear what he said, it was obvious and straightforward. But we bought a section, we got a plan like a book off a local building company and we chose a plan out of a book. And we [changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1024s) the downstairs around a bit to suit the sun, showed it to a couple of local Brethren, they said, "Yeah, that looks simple enough." And we got the house built.

When it was nearly finished, Bruce Hales drove past the house because there was a section down the road the Brethren were thinking of buying for a city hall and Bruce was in the city. So they drove him to look at the city hall section and they drove past this house and someone [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1054s) the car said, "Oh, that's Peter Hart's house." And Bruce said, "I didn't say Peter Hart can build a house."

And so this was relayed to me afterwards and I got, yeah, shock of my life. And my wife and, well, we were both upset about it because, and of course all the Brethren knew about it within like about two hours. Yeah, because they all had their noses put out of joint that I was building a house because no one else had ever built a house in the last few years because you weren't supposed to.

And even, yeah, people very close to me, my own family, said after that, they said, "Oh, you must have misunderstood what Bruce said to you."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1109s)

Meanwhile, he's just a liar.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1110s)

Yeah, or they didn't tell me I was a liar, but I, you know, I was just dirt. No, he's the liar, I'm saying Bruce Hales is the liar.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1119s)

He tells you one thing then he lies about it. That's normal.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1123s)

Yeah, I didn't think of him as a liar, but what I thought was he just doesn't, he doesn't give a damn for another person's feelings. Yeah, he didn't sort of think when he opened his mouth, "I didn't tell Peter Hart he could build a house." He didn't stop to think, "Well, maybe I did say it and I forgot. Maybe I shouldn't open my mouth and say I didn't tell him about the house. Maybe I should just not before I open my mouth."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1150s)

He's not kind, because it's going to, either him or his father were nice people. Sorry, Bruce Hales is not a nice person. Like they're not kind, gentle, caring leaders, him or his father.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1163s)

Yeah, so my impression was he's not upset, he doesn't give a damn for another person's feelings.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1171s)

Yeah, and that's not, that shouldn't be a leader of a Christian church. No, I'm absolutely, I'm mind-blown right now. I don't even know what to say. I did not know that this was a rule. I can't believe we're having this conversation. I'm seriously, I'm sitting here and I'm like, I feel like an outsider right now listening to this podcast and my mind is blown that there is people asking Bruce if they can build a house. [Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1201s) you realize like how crazy this sounds? He controls everything. And now his, Gareth Hales, owns a, what was it, a nine million or seven million dollar house?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1216s)

It's 9.5 Australian, which would be, yeah, about six million, seven million American.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1224s)

Okay, six, seven million dollar house and he was telling Peter to keep his house simple. Oh, what year was this, Peter?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1237s)

Oh, about 2002, I think. 2002\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1245s)

I just... Just when he came to power. So, am I just, maybe I never, is this always been a rule? Like, has this, this has always been a rule I did not know?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1254s)

No, around about then or after then there was a rule that you couldn't build a house. So I think it was after that. Yeah, that's right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1260s)

What was the reasoning behind it?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1263s)

So after that, the Ministry Index came out with John Hales' ministry and he had said quite plain that you shouldn't build a house. So after that, the rule became no, you should not build a house. That was the blanket rule. And of course I had built a house, so I was a black sheep and apparently Bruce had said I should build a house. I had misunderstood him and I was just a black sheep. But I didn't actually sell the house. I asked a [brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1293s) with a level head, it was one of two of them, and one of them said, "Hold on, if I should sell the house," and he said, "No, don't sell it, just live in it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1304s)

So I got a question though, wasn't Jesus a carpenter?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1316s)

What would we do without Lane's spiritual insight? Right? I'm just your local atheist.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1325s)

It's very odd.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1326s)

Because Bruce Hales accused me of building my own house. One phone call I had with him after I had that car accident, he said, "You built your own house," and it wasn't true at all, there's not a grain of truth in it. I didn't bother to contradict him, but just generally contradicting views. But yeah, it seems to be, you know, some weird thing he has. If you don't, if you haven't built your own house, he tells you you have, and if you have, he tells you he didn't give you permission. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1356s) you can't really win, can you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1357s)

And I don't, I don't understand the reason. Yeah, because he's like, "You'll like it too much." Like you can't have something if you want it too much. So it has to be something you only kind of want, but you can buy a $7 million house. I'm so confused.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1374s)

Well, no, the way I was just playing to us. Sorry. Go ahead. Go on, Peter. Go ahead, Peter.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1383s)

No, I was just going to take you through the process that followed on from me building a house and the process over the next few years. So after I built the house, you weren't allowed to build houses.

But then a rule came in that you could buy a house and you could alter it, okay? And so that's what Brethren that wanted to build houses, that's what they did. They bought a house and they altered it. But you could, you could demolish it, but you had to leave one wall standing. I'm not joking. Yeah, yeah. In Vancouver they did that. They bought these houses because they wanted these houses close to the airport and close to the meeting room and they would leave one wall standing and then rebuild the whole [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1425s) around it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1428s)

And so who gets mad if you take that wall down? Is he, does he cares about walls? This is actually new, like I was in for 18 years and I didn't know about this. I had no idea about this either. No idea. Like, what would be the biblical teaching that supports the one wall?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1456s)

Well, because John Hales said you shouldn't build a house, so that was the typical way of getting around, that you leave a wall standing. I suppose if you just leave a stand standing like four inches long, I suppose it's a wall?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1469s)

Yeah, right? Could a beam, a support beam, does that count? Or am I getting kind of sinful? It's, this is mind-blowing. Well yeah, my mind's blowing....

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1481s)

So then roll it on a couple of years and you've got these rich Brethren, you know, buying a whole house on a section, they leave one stud standing and they build their dream home. And then roll it on a couple of years and then Bruce, the Lord, had moved on and turned the corner and you could build a house after that. But you had to bring it up in the care meeting. You had to tell the Brethren in the care meeting that you were building a house, and I'm not joking again, yes. So you had [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1512s) saying in the care meeting that, "I'm building a house on such and such a site," and another brother would with saying to the microphone that, "Yes, so-and-so spoken with me and I'm really happy about it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1526s)

Hypothetically, if Jesus is watching these care meetings, he's sleeping. This is the most boring, like who cares about your, what does that have to do with the Bible teachings? It's just like what, you know what it kind of makes me sad. Like I'm going back to, it was Lara Payne's podcast, right, where she asked to bring up her sexual abuse in a care meeting and was denied it. But yet they bring up building homes in a care meeting. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1556s) just, I really, I had no and I, we're totally sidetracking, I apologize Peter, but I'm just literally, I did not know that this was a rule and my mind is just having to catch up with everything you're saying and digest this process.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1576s)

It, yeah, sorry, go on, go on. It's so stupid because that only lasted like six months and then the building house thing had really taken off. And Brethren are building houses, but like first of all it had to be simple, then it didn't have to be simple. And now Brethren are building houses like 600 square meters is pretty normal. Yeah, 6,000 square feet.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1601s)

My brother's is 7,500 square feet.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1605s)

Yeah, I believe that. Like, I've heard that Bruce Hales' house is 1,000 square metres. Square metres? Sure enough. Gareth's is bigger than his.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1621s)

Which one? His new one or his present one? His townhouse. The way he was. Oh yeah, yeah. The city house. The weekday one. Not the weekend. Yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1632s)

Okay. Some of them have got their houses so big they're having to hire housekeepers because their wives can't clean them all.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1638s)

Oh, bad. You'd need a ride-on vacuum cleaner, wouldn't you?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1641s)

Well, how many mornings are they hungover? Sorry, what was that? I'm just asking how many mornings are they hungover? Yeah, that's true, too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1650s)

That cuts into the cleaning. Yeah. Okay, let's go back on track. Let's go back to your leading up to leaving.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1659s)

Yeah, so that was a bit of an incident. Another incident I had which was after that is a brother was taking a meeting in Wellington and he read the scripture in Matthew 18, verse 20, it says, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them." And he said that scripture only applies to the Brethren. The [Lord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1689s) wouldn't go to any other gathering of men.

And I knew this was a bit of a thing in the Brethren and I very bravely or stupidly said in that meeting, it was a city meeting with 380 Brethren there, I very stupidly said, "How can we say that? The Lord will go where he wants to go. We can't limit the Lord." And [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1720s) meeting just dissolved. The meeting had hardly started and it just sort of stopped. And the rest of the meeting was just everyone throwing bricks at me from all over the room.

And one brother said, "You need to stop being against Bruce Hales. You need to stop your, you know, your behavior, the way that you're against Bruce." And all [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1750s), there's just these rocks being thrown at me in the meeting.

And my wife was upset, she was crying. And yeah, you've been publicly attacked. It was my job to find preachers that night for the next day. I went to a brother after the meeting, said, "Look, can you do this for me?" He said, "Yeah, sure." And I went home. I didn't sleep or work that night. It was, yeah, it was pretty shocking.

And of course, I got a priestly visit after [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1783s). I had to apologize or get shut up. I'm sure I would have got shut up if I hadn't apologized. But you were right. Yeah, I knew I was right. And what's more, I knew I had ministry from JND and FER and JT to support it in black and white, which I pulled up in this priestly visit. I had the script, I had the references there and I said, "Look, this is exactly what they said. It's there in black and white." And they said, "Yeah, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1813s) Bruce Hales said this."

And so that was the end of it. Yeah, and I was in no financial position or, I just didn't feel I was ready to get kicked out. Yeah, at that stage. That was about 10 years before I did get finally kicked out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1838s)

So you were kind of questioning the leader though for quite a few years before you actually left or got kicked out.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1846s)

Yeah, well about from about that time on, I would pray privately that Bruce Hales would get exposed. I knew he was no good.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1861s)

Full exposure. It kind of grows to see him fully exposed.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1864s)

And in the meetings, in the prayer meeting on Monday night, I had to pray for Bruce Hales because if you didn't, you would get asked, "Why don't you pray for Bruce Hales?" So I would, about every second Monday night, I would pray for him, but that was it. I just pray for Bruce Hales. I wouldn't go on with all the other stuff, "Pray for our beloved brother, he'll be strengthened..." Oh, I can't remember all the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1894s)

Let's tell the listeners what a prayer meeting was. So Monday night in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, they go to church 365 days a year. Monday night is the prayer meeting, they call it, and that's where all the men ranging from age even as young as 12 years old...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1910s)

12 you have to start.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1911s)

And the church, the local city will split up into small groups of about 50 and then the men will get up one at a time and all have to pray out loud into a mic, kind of weird. And if you start praying for weird things like celebrities, or if you pray for Bin Laden getting caught, I did that once, they don't like that. You have to pray for, you have to like stick to the script.

So it's got to be, it sounds like this, "God and Father, [pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1941s) for, you know, Mr. Bruce or Bruce Hales or Mr. Hales," whichever you prefer. And then you'd hit like your family, you'd be like, "Dad and Mommy and like, you know, this person," and you'd name all the sick people. And then you'd be like, there'll be like good government sometimes you pray for, like good government, and that would get you a couple brownie points. And then you'd be like, "Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen," fast as you can.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1964s)

Or you just, and that was funny, sometimes you get a laugh after that one. That's right, that's the prayer meeting, yep.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1976s)

Sorry, my rants.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=1978s)

So, another thing was around about that time, I was printing the Brethren directory. I'm a printer, well I was back then. And I was printing the Brethren directory, the New Zealand-wide one. There was a spiral-bound directory with the phone numbers in.

Well, just go back a little bit. In 2005, the Action Campaign, there were seven brothers who were campaigning the government, and it was all supposed to be secret, which was quite stupid really. It was done all over the world, but they hired houses so they could register their name at these hired houses, so it was all secret. But of course, it all got out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2035s) hit the media and the media exposed it. And they were exposed as the Secret Seven.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2043s)

What were they fighting against? It was same-sex marriage, wasn't it?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2046s)

Oh no, no, this was campaigning for a new government.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2050s)

Oh okay, okay, oh this is campaigning, gotcha.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2053s)

I can't remember what government was in, but they were campaigning for a particular government.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2057s)

Helen Clark with Labour, wasn't it? Yeah, no, campaign for the National government. It was Don Brash for National Party, which is like the right-wing party. That's right. And they wanted Brash in and Clark out because she was too far left for their liking.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2073s)

Yeah. So, and about the time, just before they were, about the time of the campaign, just before, Bruce Hales came to Wellington for fellowship meetings, and these seven brothers met Bruce Hales in a house in Wellington, at the leading brother's house.

And then when it all hit the fan, the media, they told the media, it was published in the newspaper, they told the media that they had no instructions from Australia, it was completely their own exercise as concerned businessmen. They were financing it, it had nothing to do with the church.

And then afterwards, after it all sort of was all over, there was this new thing called SIS, is Strategic Information Services, they called it, a newsletter which was put out by a different group of Brethren which every business was expected to subscribe to. And I was sent an email. There was I think something like $300 a month you could [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2145s) to this useless information sheet.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2150s)

That's a lot of money. Sorry? That's a lot of money for something so silly.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2154s)

For something you wouldn't even read. And I returned the email and said, "This sounds, you know, is this for financing the campaign?" Because the campaign cost something like 1.2 or 1.6 million or something. And I asked them point blank, "Is this for financing the campaign?" Because I was keeping them honest. You know, they were told the media that they were financing themselves and it had nothing to do with the church. And [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2187s) mysteriously, about two weeks later, I was asked to give back all the files for the business, for the Brethren directory that I had.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2200s)

So they started getting nervous. Yeah, they didn't like that question. Presumably, they never actually answered you. They never actually admitted that it was for financing the campaign, I presume. 

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2219s)

No, it obviously was, yeah.

So I was sort of on a watch list, you know, from way back. Yeah. Yeah, so, yeah, I had a couple of other things which I wasn't happy about.

Another interesting thing that happened was in my business. As I said, I started my own business. It was printing, but then I branched off into, the printing was sort of changing, it was going digital and we were just getting into computers then.

But before we got into computers, I'd already seen that printing was getting more and more difficult. So I bought a couple of businesses importing CD and DVD cases and also started printing CDs and DVDs. And this was before the Brethren had computers.

So I didn't actually have to have a computer to duplicate CDs and DVDs. It's just standalone machines, but I sort of had to keep it hush-hush and my dad said to me, he said, "Look, I don't mind what you're doing, but the Brethren aren't gonna like it."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2300s)

My grandma was so against CDs when they came out because remember when they would send them, they'd send things in the mail that had a CD and it was like advertising and stuff on the CDs. Well, my grandma would break them and then hang them in pieces from the tree to scare away crows or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2321s)

The mirror works, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2322s)

That's all they're good for. That's all those memory discs are good for.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2327s)

White books would be good for that, wouldn't they?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2329s)

I don't know what's wrong with digital media, but they were so scared of it at first. You thought that like Satan himself had designed it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2337s)

Yeah, so anyway, one of my main customers, one of my big customers was a nationwide church called the Arise Church in New Zealand, which was an evangelical Pentecostal church. And so they had good solid Christian sermons and I used to listen to these, which was forbidden of [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2367s). I listened to them in the car and that was my first sort of eye-opener to the fact that the Brethren preachings are just simply lame.

And the gobbledygook or very boring, and these people out there that preach, they're interesting and they've got good teaching. And hey, there's lots of decent Christians out there. And I listened to this stuff a lot. So that was a real eye-opener to me.

And yeah, so going forward in my business, I branched off from that. The CD and DVD stuff was going quite well. I branched off into manufacturing digital touchscreens, which went quite well. It was before the bulk manufacturer of iPads and that sort of stuff. So these are touch screens for retail [stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2447s) for advertising, and that branched into more the medical side of stuff.

I got into manufacturing medical stuff for operating theatres. That was a mistake, that was a bad decision. It was too big and I got into financial difficulty. And if you ever get into financial difficulty in the Brethren, they never forget it. It's talked about, it's gossiped about.

There was a time after the GFC, Global Financial Crisis, where Bruce Hales decided to have a look at all the Brethren businesses worldwide that were in trouble. And I was one of them. So my books were sent over to Bruce Hales and there was a couple of brothers from New Zealand that were present when they were looked at. And some instructions came back from Bruce Hales about what I was to do.

It was really bad advice. It was just really dumb. So I thought, "Well, what I'm going to do is just, I won't just throw the toys out of the pot. I won't say anything, I won't sort of say no, I'm not going to do this." I thought, "I'll just do it real, real, really slow and hope everyone forgets about it." So that's what I did.

And so over the course of the next probably two years, I managed to pull that business around and sell it, that side of the business. And I sold that side of the business and the good side of the business has gone really, really well ever since and completely turned it around. But that's a bit like what I came across with the Brethren is that they couldn't sort of delve into, they had to sort of look at the thing as a whole.

I was told to sell the whole business as it is. I would have come out with absolutely nothing. The whole thing, I would have worked for a brother, I would have had no money, worked for a brother and basically been locked into the Brethren with no money. But I did it my own way, and well, the common sense way I should say, and came out on top.

So soon after that, one of my sons was married and he wanted to, and he got married and he had a stick job in Wellington with a local brother in Wellington and he needed to change his job. And I had, I'd sold this business, I had spare capacity to employ him and start another business to employ him. I only had a small business at that stage, you know, a good small [business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2641s) which I couldn't really employ him in my current business, so I had to start another business to employ him. I had the money to do that and we put together a business plan. He was keen to work for me.

It was a good solid plan. I spoke to a couple of brothers about it. They both said no. One brother said, "No, you need two million dollars to start a business." And I said, "Rubbish." I said, "You can start a business with $45. All you need is a bucket and a window cleaning brush. You can start a business." Yeah, what did he say to that? "No, no, Bruce Hales said you need two million dollars to start a business, so you can't start a business for your son."

And in the upshot, yeah, my son wanted to work for me, you know, he couldn't start a business himself because he was too young and he had a new house with a big [mortgage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2699s). So in the end, he had married a girl from Australia and he, in the end, he got offered a job in Australia.

And in the end, he moved to Australia. You know, we were really upset. It was the first married son. They were expecting their first child, so first grandchild. There were a lot of tears and they were moving to Australia. And I had to sign a piece of paper by the Brethren to say I was happy for him to move to Australia so I wasn't causing trouble.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2732s)

So you were forced to sign something?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2734s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2735s)

Yeah, that's not legal.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2737s)

To say I was happy about it. Wow. Because I tried to employ him and it was refused.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2745s)

Pressuring someone into signing something is not legal. I want to remind our viewers, you'll remember a while back we did some podcasts with CanadaLand and Merrick Grimshaw had come out with some quotes in this CanadaLand podcast through them. So I just want to, I just want to, this is a perfect time, I just want to bring this up.

PBCC spokesperson Merrick Grimshaw tells us that church member companies are under no obligation to join UBT and that they are able to do business with whomever they choose. They also tell us that the church has no legal, financial, or any other interest in its members' business.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2790s)

Yeah, I love that "no obligation" bit. I didn't join UBT. I refused to because I had no time for their stuff and I had no money for it, especially when I was struggling. And yet I was known over the country as being against UBT because I wouldn't join, and it was spoken against behind my back and despised for it. But yeah, there's no obligation.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2816s)

Yeah, I mean, this is why we have these conversations. To get, like, you've got so many stories, Peter. Like, there's just so much inside you and it's recent, right? I mean, you just left, what, you just left in 2020, is that when you, yeah, you left in 2020\. Like, it's so, that's why I wanted to bring in some of this current, this current stuff that Merrick Grimshaw is reporting is because we're not applying this something 30 years ago, right? We're applying this to Peter's [current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2846s) situation that has happened within the last however many years.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2849s)

Yeah, I mean there is so much to talk about. We've been talking for 45 minutes already. We could keep on going. I mean, like a quarter of the way through what there is to talk about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2859s)

That's okay, keep going.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2860s)

Yes, but just to wind it forward, yeah, like, yeah, I wanted to forward to about June 2020\. My wife said to me, "Look, you've got to talk to the Brethren about your problems." She said to me, "You're not reading the white books." And I said to her, "Look, they just don't make sense." And she was horrified that I would say that. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2891s) she said, "No, you've got to talk to them." I said, "Well, I don't want to," because I knew what would happen.

Yeah, I knew, you know, but this was 10 years or 12 years after that other incident when I'd come up against the wall before, when I knew I couldn't leave. But it was in a different place there, and I just felt I just couldn't [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2922s) brush over things again.

And she insisted on it, and bless her soul, she thought I would get help. She didn't, I don't think she thought it would end like this. And so first of all, since I said “The white books don't make sense," I took them on on a theological point.

I said, "Okay, well." So I told a brother, I ran up a brother and said, "Look, my wife wants me to talk to you. I told her the white books don't make sense." And he said, "Okay, well, I'll come around and bring my other brother." And so they said, "Okay, what's not making sense?" And I said, "Well, Bruce Hales says that in his ministry that [Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=2973s) was sent to the earth."

And there's an issue, I won't spend too long on this, but it's all pretty theological, but there was an issue in 1923 with JT called the eternal sonship of Christ, yeah, where JT made it clear that in the past eternity, Jesus was God and so he decided to come to earth himself. He wasn't sent to earth, he decided to come with his own free will. And here's Bruce Hales saying on several occasions, "Jesus was sent to the earth." And so we had some quite long discussions about that and these brothers were sort of panel-beating Bruce's words to fit what JT had said and it was just a waste of time.

And then it turned into talking about other things. I also said about them saying that every single word that comes out of Bruce's mouth is Christ's words. I said I disagree with that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3055s)

Even when he grunts and sneezes?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3056s)

Even when he grunts and sneezes or even when he calls someone a bastard. When he called Braden Simmons a bastard in the meeting, I said to them about that...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3068s)

...or tell someone to eat rat poison.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3069s)

Yeah, I said, well, they said, "Oh, well, Paul used the word bastard in scripture." And I said, "Yeah, but he used it in the sense of what the word means, as an illegitimate son, not a derogatory term." I mean, everyone knows who Braden Simmons's father is. And they didn't have an answer for that.

And we talked about other things too, about, you know, Bruce Hales liking money and surrounding himself with the best of everything. And they said, "Oh, money means absolutely nothing to Bruce Hales." That's hilarious. Comedians.

And I said that in the recordings, John Hales was rude. So I sort of let it rip really. I let all my feelings out. And they quickly probably confined you after that?

We had a total of I think four priestlies, I think, and then we started talking about the court cases. I'd found out about the court cases which I wasn't supposed to do, and the court cases being Peter Harrison and Braden's court case.

And so we talked about those and then I refused to have any more priestly visits. And yeah, and they said, "Oh, can we just have a five-minute visit?" And so then I knew, well, that was to shut down.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3170s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3171s)

And then my mum rang me. So it was in the morning they rang for that, they said, so we arranged for a priestly visit in the afternoon. And then my mum rang me up and she said, "Can't you just, yeah, can't you just stay?" she said.

That's hard. Yeah, like there's nothing, there's nothing like that feeling when the family just begs you, especially a mom.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3203s)

It's the hardest one to get over. Yeah, it's the hardest one to get over.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3210s)

Yep. So we had our phone call but that was it. And they shut me up for two things: for talking against the man of God and for talking to a person that was not in the fellowship and not telling them who it is. That was the two things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3231s)

So right there you have it, listeners. If you question anything, even if it blatantly doesn't make sense, even if you can see that it's wrong or even immoral, you still have to follow, blindly follow. And as soon as you question, you're done. You know, I think like, I mean, Carman can attest to this because she's found an excellent [church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3261s), but like when you think of Christianity, the first word that comes to me would be compassion, would be kindness, would be caring, would be...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3273s)

Altruism.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3274s)

Yeah, there's everything coming together out of love, right? And if you have a group that is wanting to be called a mainstream Christian church, those members should be able to go to somebody with their issues and be compassionately welcomed. And it not be about a man of God, it would, everything should turn back to the Bible, right? It should go back to the teachings of the [Bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3305s), not the teachings of a man of God. How weak is your foundation when you can't stand up to the teeniest ridicule?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3314s)

Yeah, well, that's what all this came back to, Bruce Hales. And yeah, that's really what I was shut up for, was questioning the man of God.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3325s)

Which is hilarious. Like you can't, you can't question this guy. You know why though? Is because if he allowed anyone to question him, he wouldn't be able to have answers. He's not intelligent enough, he's not smart enough to be able to have even basic questions about the Bible. He would probably fail, right? So he's like, "Are you questioning me? Are you questioning my father?" And how he ups his own ego, right? How he strokes his ego is by talking about his father being this [man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3357s) that couldn't make a mistake and everything. He's brushing himself, right? He's saying that he's incapable of making mistakes. He's just incapable of questioning him. And it's all just so culty. And once you take a look outside the Brethren for the first time, when you open your eyes to the world, you realize that they're just another fault, like all the others.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3380s)

And of course they kept on trying to trip me up. They asked what I thought of Aberdeen. So I just fudged my way through that one. Did you just lie?

Yeah, well, I hadn't sort of thought about that at that stage. And they asked me, they kept on trying to get me on some moral, a moral thing. They kept on saying, "There must, there must be some immoral thing. Are you going on with some sort of sin?" I said, "No, I'm squeaky clean." "But you must be, there must be something in your history, there must be something that you're hiding because you're questioning the man of God." There must be, just [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3426s) it always comes back to some immoral thing that someone's going on with. I said, "Well, tell me what it is."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3434s)

These people jump to conclusions faster than anybody. They make massive, massive jumps and gaps and just blame for no reason. It's really pathetic.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3447s)

It's very interesting you say that because when I was in trouble and they were questioning me, it was very much the same line. They were saying, "Well, you must have done something." And they came up with this idea that I'd cheated on my wife, which is completely false, totally unrelated to anything that I had done. I had no idea where it even came from. And they kept pressing this.

And it was kind of, you realize after a while that it was the same kind of reasoning that it's because I'd had a really bad motor accident. And the kind of reasoning was, "Well, there's terrible things happened to you, so you must have done [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3482s) wrong because God's obviously punishing you for something." And that is just a disgusting way to think. Yeah, they pushed it so hard, I seriously considered admitting to it even though it wasn't true at all because I could see that they weren't going to let me back with my family until I've confessed whatever they wanted me to confess to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3503s)

So while we're in here talking again, so I have my list of Merrick Grimshaw's quotes handy today. Here's another quote. He said, "The PBCC also denies that they have a formal hierarchy. However, their website lists Bruce Hales as the church's most senior leader."

**Lane Admiraal**

This is such a joke. Such a joke. There's such a hierarchy. And guess who's waking his way up the ladder? My little brother, Jim Admiraal, is in Australia right now working with Gareth and Dean and Charles Hales and they're getting ready to do a big UBT, probably fundraising of some kind. So they have a massive hierarchy, that's total bullcrap.

And my [older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3558s) brother is also going up in the hierarchy, Lee Admiraal. And I've got a story for you guys today. So back in, I guess November is when Americans have their Thanksgiving, and my younger brother Jim decides to have a massive, massive Thanksgiving party, invites Roy Symington's widow, I forget her name, Rhoda Markham, up. So they have this huge, my brother Lee's there, my dad's there, they have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3588s) massive Thanksgiving party in a tent out back. They've got a bar, they've got a menu, it's nuts, right?

Then like literally, I think it was like a week or two ago, a letter gets read out in all of North America stating that there's been instances of the Brethren breakdown in something in fellowship and on the along the lines of celebrating worldly holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. Okay, right in there. But are you ready for it? [Guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3631s) who signed the bottom of the letter? Lee Matthew Admiraal. My brother is the biggest hypocrite ever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3643s)

Oh, wow. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3649s)

So Peter, so when did you, did you leave with your family? Like I don't know the whole story. Like who, when you got excommunicated, like did your wife, did your wife come with you?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3662s)

No, no, she was absolutely, so right through the whole time, she has been absolutely with Bruce Hales. The whole time, we've had very careful discussions about Bruce in the past. I've had to sort of tiptoe around that subject. Yeah, no, there's no way that she, she was very, very loyal to Hales. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3693s) she was extremely upset. She was crying through, especially through that the last couple of interviews, the whole time.

Yeah, she, yeah. So I've got five children and three grandchildren. I haven't been told about the last one, so I don't know her name.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3718s)

That's heartbreaking. See, they weaponize the family against, and then they claim that it's the family's choice and it's not a Brethren direction. We know that it's directed by the Brethren, you know, it's directed by, they just, yeah, yeah, exactly. If they just had open hearts, if they were even a teeny bit Christian, they would communicate with people regardless of judgment. Instead, they hold judgment and think that they know you, think they know [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3752s) your life and then they don't even tell you when you have a grandchild. That's disgusting. That's disgusting.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3759s)

Yeah, so and even the, even the Brethren of Wellington, I mean, my daughter was 18 when she was, when I was shut up. She was really upset that Friday afternoon with that five-minute visit. She, my wife rang her and told her, she just walked out straight away. She was so upset.

And she actually, her boss complained four weeks later that she was underperforming at work, and then complained again, and so she left her job. She was so upset.

And my son that's one up from there, so I lived at home for three months after I was shut up. He came, I was working at home because I only worked part-time at that stage, I sold half my business, so I was at home. And he came home from work one day upset. I said, "What's the matter?" He said, "Oh, work's not going well."

And so I got straight on the phone to the, well I didn't phone, I emailed the priest straight away and said, "You've got to sort this out. My son's upset, I can't talk to him, I'm not allowed to talk to him too much. So you gotta sort, he's having problems at work, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3852s) gotta sort this out." As a result, he got put off from his work. And yeah, they weren't very sympathetic, clearly. That's, yeah, it was really, really hard on my kids. So they take it out on those two younger ones.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3871s)

So that's clear evidence that the church punishes the family even for, you know, someone leaving the church. You know what I mean? Even though the family did nothing wrong.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3881s)

Yeah, well, I think, you know, a lot of Brethren are kind to them, but there's also ones that aren't sympathetic. And of course, in their businesses, this boss was worried about my daughter underperforming. Well, what an asshole. I mean, that's cruel. What do you expect?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3897s)

Yeah. Yeah. I had the same experience when I was in trouble. Two of my children in succession were, one was demoted and one was taken out of a business. And in hindsight, I think it was a deliberate strategy from a high level to put more and more pressure on me to try and force me to either leave or to kind of repent and rejoin. When they've got you in that shut up position, they try and put as much stress on you as possible. The [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3929s) of theory is that if they get you sufficiently stressed, you will actually kind of flip and convert or else get out of their hair. I believe it's very deliberate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3941s)

It is. Let's, let's read them. If there's any Brethren listening, I just wanted to remind you of a little scripture here if you're thinking about punishing people. "Fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers. Every man should be put to death for his own sin." That's Deuteronomy 24:16. You can fact-check me if you don't believe me. I've been doing a little Bible research. So there is absolutely no excuse for you to punish people when someone else [leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3971s). That's, that is just so wrong and not even close to what they preach in Christianity. Like they're so far from it.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=3981s)

Yeah, and so I followed up an email to these priests afterwards saying that I'm concerned about my family's health because I was concerned about my wife's health and my children's health. But all three children that were living at home, I was concerned about their mental health.

And I emailed them and asked them about it, about quite a few things. And their response to the one about the mental health was that if they become extremely unwell, you'll hear about it. So that was it. So basically if they probably, if they commit suicide, I'll hear about it. Yeah, great. That's unbelievable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4028s)

My heart just breaks for you, Peter, like because it's just so still new. Like how are you doing now? Like how do you cope with everything? Because I mean, it takes years to start unraveling everything and digest and it's hard. I can't even imagine having kids and grandkids and an ex-wife that's still in there. Like how are you doing?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4054s)

Yeah, I'm actually doing amazingly well. I was able to keep the business and the business that I kept has gone really, really well since. It's going four times better than when it was in there. So I've only just started working full-time again. Like for the first couple of years, I couldn't sort of concentrate enough. I just had to look after myself. Yeah, yeah, and just work when I felt [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4084s) it. So I would just, you know, a typical day, I'll just go out for a coffee and maybe not even work that day, you know, because I just couldn't push myself. I had to really nurse myself along. But no, I'm doing really well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4103s)

If your kids were to watch this, what would you say to them?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4111s)

Well, I think my kids know I love them. I'm sure they do. And I send them a birthday greeting every birthday and about half of them return it nicely and the other half don't. But there's no ill feelings there at all because I know they feel they shouldn't. And of course, they're welcome to contact me anytime and they know that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4141s)

And to experience what real freedom is in Christianity. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Peter, what's some of the first things that you tried when you left?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4157s)

Oh, well, I went to another church straight away. I went to Lindy's church.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4166s)

A lot better, a little more happy.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4167s)

Oh, the first thing I noticed was, so Lindy's a pastor and her husband, and there were two sets of pastors at that church. And so they sort of take turns and the pastors that aren't on that week, they sit up the back somewhere and the people just sit all over the place and there's no hierarchy and there's no important people there and [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4198s) all so relaxed.

And you come as you are and the people are there because they want to be there, not because they have to be. And they actually welcome sinners there. To the Plymouth Brethren, you know? They don't say that, "I'm pure and, oh, we can't have that person here." Right, right.

And of course I went to the movie theater. I still haven't gone bowling, ten-pin bowling. That's still on my to-do list.

Did you ever have that moment when you sat down in church where you're like, "Wait, they're not supposed to know this"? Like there was so much that we were told that the world didn't know and there was a couple times where I sat in church and I went, "Wait, they're not supposed to know this. That was just for us." Yeah, you know. And of course, I often quote that scripture, "Where two or three are gathered together unto me, there am I in the midst of them." And they all believe it. And that's [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4270s) JND said. He said people everywhere quote that scripture and they believe it and it's true for them. Yeah. That's incredible. I was made to repent and withdraw that remark I've said, even though JND has said it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4293s)

See, it's just a stark difference, right? And that's like, that's what I always like getting this thought across to those that are in there that listen is that what you are experiencing is not Christianity. It's not Christianity.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4308s)

Yeah, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4311s)

Yeah, yeah. Well, we appreciate you coming on, Peter. I know you have like tons of stories in you and you know, we could sit here for hours upon hours hearing your stories and we obviously will bring you back on.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4327s)

And yeah, a lot more to say. I mean, I've got a bit to do with the fellowship meetings in Wellington. I don't know why because I was an outcast, but I had a bit to do behind the scenes there. I had a bit to do behind the scenes with them and there's all sorts of going on. Yeah, and there's a lot of stories.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4350s)

You want to tell that story before you go?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4353s)

Oh no, it's take too long.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4355s)

It takes too long. Okay, stay tuned people for part two with Peter. Okay, well we sure appreciate you joining us and letting us come into your world for an hour and a bit.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4370s)

Yeah, gosh, I really appreciate what you guys are doing and my heart goes out to you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4379s)

Okay, well until next time.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4382s)

I've got no regrets at all. No, I bet you don't. I mean, I struggled with guilt for the first year and a bit because I could have, like my mum said to me, "Can't you just stay?" And I could have, I could have stayed, I guess, but I would have had to lie. Yeah, you know, I would have had to say, "No, John Hales wasn't rude," and "Yes, every word that comes out of Bruce Hales's mouth is from the Lord." And you know, but I couldn't [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4412s) with that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4412s)

You'd have to live a lie, wouldn't you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4414s)

Yeah, and what a gift from a father. Like thinking of yourself as a father, what a gift to your children to know when and how to stand up and make a stance for change, right? That's what you did, right? And yes, it cost you a lot of grief, it cost you, you had to sacrifice a lot, but you showed them the way. You literally showed them the way out.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4440s)

Yeah. And I mean, that's the biggest gift you could ever give your family. Yeah, I feel bad for them and they'll be fed up that I'm evil, I know, but I really think that underneath they don't think so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4460s)

Yeah, and I think that's the beauty of how I believe compassion works. I believe eventually compassion will seep through these walls of lies and walls of injustice. I believe compassion will always work its way through, it just takes time. We need to be persistent, I think we need to, in doing what we're doing, being vulnerable [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4490s) way that we're being vulnerable and allowing people to all come forward and show our truth in this way that we aren't bad people, we're not opposers, we're not evil. We simply...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4502s)

I'm an opposer, I'm sorry, I'm a huge opposer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4510s)

They view us, right? They view us as this group of people that are just opposing Bruce Hales's word, which that's not what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is show these people that what you're in is not a Christian church. That's not a Christian church. You are not in what you think you're in.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4529s)

Yeah, I think going back, and some people disagree with me, but I think going back to the 50s, I think it was a pretty mainstream Christian church. It's where they brought in the extreme separation. Back then they started to split husbands and wives. You know, back in the late 50s, JTJr said if a wife is not a believer but the husband is, yeah, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4559s) like if a wife doesn't break bread in the Brethren but the husband does, then they need to split. Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4569s)

Yeah, and I think, I think my main goal, everybody asks me, "Like, what's your end goal, Cheryl? Like, what do you want to do?" And it is, I just want to take the cult out of the church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4579s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4579s)

That's, I mean, it might not happen in my lifetime, but at least we started it and for the generations to continue it, right? Like that is the key, is to start something where the train is rolling along enough that it reaches a destination. And that's my destination, is to take the cult out of the church so that my family and my nieces and my nephews, everybody who's in there gets to experience what a real Christian church should be.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4609s)

Yeah. Yeah. While it's a cult, they'll cover up things. Yeah. Because that's what I know. While they're trying to say it's a pure position, they have to cover up things to give that appearance.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4621s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Bruce is very, he's very smart at what he's doing. And I mean, I think, I believe he's fully aware of what he's doing.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4629s)

I fully believe he's aware of what he's doing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4629s)

Oh yeah, I do too. There's no way that someone...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4632s)

That's something I wondered about. Yeah. That's something I wondered about for years. Does he know what he's doing?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4639s)

He has to. There's, there's, yeah, there's no way. I asked a sociology professor once at the University of Waterloo that question. I said, "Does this, do these people, does, does he, the leader, really believe their own story?" And he's like, "Well, it's hard to say." It's like, it's kind of like the salesman coming out to pitch his sales team, right? And he has to tell his sales team, he's like, "Guys, come on, we got the best widget, right? Like our widget is better than all the other widgets." Does he really go back [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4669s) and be like, "We definitely have the best product"? Maybe, but you know what I mean, he's really just trying to convince because that helps sales, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4678s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4679s)

Whether he fully believes it or not is doubtful, doubtful. I mean, to like, come on, the universe is infinite as far as they've measured, infinite. And he really thinks the creator of the infinite universe chose him for a special mission.

That's the worst comic book story ever. Like it's just a terrible, like come on. Yes, I was chosen out of 14.4 billion years the universe has been around, the creator chose me for a special mission.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4715s)

I mean, even if you put him in a cape and blue tights, he still wouldn't look like a superhero, would he?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4721s)

Yeah, that's what we needed to end on.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4726s)

One little piece of advice, those little cards that you send, don't ever stop sending them. I've heard so many stories of kids that have collected all of those cards that a parent has sent and then on that one hard day, pulled that pile of cards out and said, "This is where I want to go." Hard as it is at the moment when you get some of those cards sent back, it's worth every minute.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZ19Xp3qOc&t=4753s)

Yeah, that's good. That's good. Okay, well, let's end it. Yeah, and we know Peter will be on again. I have not even a question about that. Anyhow, thanks everyone for joining us. Take care everybody. To share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife@proton.me.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
