## Summary

OneSchool Global is the PBCC school system where 9000 students are educated according to the cult's "ethos". Not a single one of those students will attend university. (Even the Taliban allows some university attendance - but not the PBCC)
Shockingly, many of these schools in Canada and Australia are government funded.
Higher education is only one of Oneschool's problems. A culture of bullying is endemic to PBCC schools, and we release audio of a secretive cult broadcast called "Strive 23" in which an anti-bullying program is proposed. We also look at Oneschool from the perspective of teachers, who often have terrible experiences. When we look at online reviews for Oneschool  on recruitment sites, the one observation that appears again and again is "Colleagues simply disappear overnight".
Sounds more like a horror movie than a school - but take a listen and judge for yourself!

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=7s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back. Today we have a really important podcast that we've been wanting and working on for quite a while, and talking to teachers and principals that have landed in our inboxes. We're going to shed some light on OneSchool Global. That's the schooling system that is inside the PBCC.

First of all, I just kind of want to clear up some messages that kind of come my way. And I think the biggest thing, the reason why we pick apart and put everything down for everybody to see. Did you see that? My plant just fell over.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=57s)

I saw something move. I was like...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=59s)

Oh, it's my dog. Sorry, my dog knocked over my plant and it's one of my favorite plants. So I had to pause and go rescue it. Anyhow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=77s)

Retrieve her weeds.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=81s)

Anyhow, so what I was saying is I just wanted to clear some air about some stuff that landed in my inbox. And we understand that hypocrisy, I mean, it happens everywhere, right? We're not blind to that. The reason why we are kind of expanding, putting something on our plate, and really pulling it apart and talking about it is because the PBCC, they are very [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=115s) bound to their separation rule, and they were withdrawing from evil.

The reason why we come in and we really allow the listeners and viewers an inside look at the hypocrisy of that is because of this rule that they live by. So as we go into the OneSchool Global stories, we understand that bullying happens in every school system. The reason why we're exploiting it in here is because they're proclaiming that they're keeping the children from this kind of stuff, yet it's just as rampant, if not more, than in any other school system.

So it is one of the biggest things that I just kind of wanted to clear up. We understand this stuff happens throughout the world. We are just choosing to let the listeners and viewers know that these people claim to not have this kind of stuff inside there. And that's why we are showing them where it is.

With that, we have a recording from their Strive 23 seminar that they had a while back, and it's to do with OneSchool Global. And we're going to play that for you. Some of you might find it boring, but that's okay. We're playing it [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=196s) for the reason inside it they talk about this new anti-bullying program that they're installing. And so we are giving the listeners an inside look at what they came across in Strive 23 for their OneSchool Global for 2023\.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=215s)

Is this the real voice of Bruce Hales?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=217s)

It's not. It's not Bruce Hales.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=222s)

Okay, who is it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=224s)

It's David...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=225s)

Heaney from Armadale.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=227s)

Okay, okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=228s)

But you have to understand, so Gareth Hales was a part of this. I think Dean Hales was a part of this, wasn't he? Oh, and John Anderson.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=234s)

John Anderson.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=235s)

Yeah. So they were all there. There were other people that took different sectors of the Strive 23\. So I'm going to play this for you guys.

### [**Strive23 Narrator**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=267s)

“...students that have just finished for supporting them through their schooling journey. So we're now listening to Mr. David Heaney from Armadale and Mr. Mick Wilson from Camden that are going to give us an update on OneSchool Global. Thanks, David. On behalf of the students and staff and our volunteers, everyone at OneSchool is incredibly thankful for the investment that is made in the school from enterprises, business, and individuals within the ecosystem.

Just add to your reference, Mark, is to contributing to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=298s) economy. We had that recent reference to what a wonderful service to run a bus. We have 693 buses globally, so morning and evening we have 700 volunteers living, transferring precious cargo. Good number. Today we want to highlight how OneSchool is working to ensure that the investment is paying dividends for our students and our community into the future and highlight the dividends it's paying right now.

[Share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s) with us the focus of 2023\.

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

Thanks, Dave. So 2023, we'll be striving to improve culture on campus. In 2022, our focus was all about the attraction, retention, and development of staff. That's an ongoing challenge because there's an industry-wide shortage of good teachers. But when it comes to job satisfaction, whilst we're doing everything we can to improve paying condition for teachers, we know that it's the small things that we put down to culture that can make an outsized difference.

So that could just be the parent that reaches out to a teacher to thank them for going the extra mile, or the student that responds positively to some constructive criticism. But one thing we do know, Dave, is that if teachers feel highly valued, they'll be far more motivated, far more energized to put everything they can into their lessons, to get everything they can out of their students.

### [**David Heaney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

So you've been to a lot of campuses globally, please tell us what good culture looks like on campus.

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

Well, some points are parents are supportive of students and teachers and the campus administrators and also the parents are engaged with students and with the operations of the school. Student [attendance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=402s) is high, academic results get stronger. A good example of culture, you have a group of students supporting one another, you get healthy competition, peer support, that's a good cohort.

### [**David Heaney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

So there'd be room for improvement in all the campuses?

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

Absolutely, Mick. That's what we're striving for in 2023\. I will note we've seen campuses turn around from not so good culture to good culture in six months by applying some of these [principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=432s).

### [**David Heaney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

Yeah, very good.

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

And one of the programs that we'll be using to strive for better culture in 2023 is Operation Elevate. And that's all about one global school with one global standard. So that could be one standard in behaviour, one standard in facility management, one standard in punctuality. We've already kicked this off with an anti-bullying program. Could move to things as simple as like uniform consistency. [Dave,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=463s) tell us about how we're going to measure good culture in 2023\.

### [**David Heaney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

Well, we measure all sorts of things at OSG. For example, we measure the number of minutes spent on Zoom lessons. This past year, it's over 1.9 million hours of time spent with 264,000 Zoom lessons. Another measure is we do 11 million kilometres in our buses each year, that's 28 trips to the moon. But there's three key areas we're measuring around culture. It's difficult to measure, but we can determine our culture is growing. Firstly, parent support and engagement, secondly, student attendance, and thirdly, student achievement.

The three measures will be able to review globally, broken down into region and campus doing enable us to see where there's strong performance and where we need improvement. The way we measure parent and student engagement, as you can see on the screen, is by parent logins to Streamline 3\. As a parent, one way you can support OneSchool is ultimately checking your child's learning through the computer activity each week.

There are three sets of numbers you can see on the screen here, parent activity each week, student device monitor SDM activity each week and students check by SDM each week. You can see there's a variance in numbers, some are performing very well, some need improvement. I'd like to pick on the first line which is parent engagement and we are aiming for 100%. It's ambitious but it highlights the importance we place on the [engagement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=568s) of parents with their child's online activity.

The second point we want to refer to is attendance. Student attendance rates are a strong indication of good culture. If a student wants to be at school that's telling us that culture is good, the campus is strong. For example, we have the student with 95% attendance, they're missing 10 days per year. What we're aiming for in 2023 is 97%. At the moment we have campuses down as [low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=599s) as 78% and some at 96%. Let's do it better and get to 97%. That'll prove that the culture's good.

Finally, the measurement around student achievement is our MAP testing, which we'd all be aware of. There's more than 10 million students globally undertake the MAP growth test, providing us with a very strong measure of students' individual growth but also our student performance compared to others outside our community. Currently our students are performing above average, 16 percent growing year on year, which we're appreciative and thankful for.

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

But you tell us how [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=638s) can contribute to do our bit for OSG.

### [**David Heaney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

I think it's a good question, Dave, and really we appreciate any small sacrifice made by anyone in OneSchool and I think that everyone can help us raise our game and get behind Operation Elevate. Staff tell us that they want to keep the community, that is the community feel within our campuses, so we're all about keeping open lines of communication, particularly between parents and [subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=669s) teachers. We feel that that helps to break down barriers, build rapport and present a united front to students in view of their progress.

I'd just like to put in a bit of a plug for the CA teams. We're always looking for fresh talent on the campus administration teams. These are the guardians of our ethos. So if you do get a tap on the shoulder to join a CA team, just remember that variety is the spice of life. And we can promise you plenty of that and a lot of fun along the way.

### [**Mick Wilson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=328s)

That's good. Staff also tell us that the support of the ecosystem and individuals within it, OneSchool Global is like no other school. The value of financial investment in OneSchool by the ecosystem can't be understated. However, it is the additional engagement and volunteer support that helps us provide dividends to the community from this investment. Our students are the community and business leaders of tomorrow, and anything we can do to increase the success in that investment is the investment of the future of [our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=729s) community.

### [**Strive23 Narrator**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=267s)

Thanks, Mark. That's from OSG. Excellent, Dave. Thank you. And thank you, Mick. Very insightful.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=737s)

So you notice how he said, "it will prove our culture is good," hey? As he's in there talking. Like, why do you need to prove your culture is good?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=745s)

Yeah. It was hard to hear some of it, but I liked the "variety is the spice of life." I'm like, wait a second, you guys don't even allow interracial marriages.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=755s)

Yeah. Well, I'll put the transcript up on a Facebook post and you can link to it so anyone can read it. But I mean, the point is what they're kind of skirting around and when they're talking about trying to improve the culture and their Elevate program is that what they're really saying is they've got a lousy culture and they're desperate to do something about it. And as they say, they've kicked it off with an anti-bullying program.

And that's really, I think, the biggest issue. Well, they've got two very big issues. One, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=786s) they hint at, it's getting increasingly difficult for them to recruit staff because staff don't want to be associated with such a weird and oppressive regime. And secondly, they've got a massive bullying problem in there, and they always have had. That's really the two takeaways from that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=804s)

I want to quickly tell the listeners, give them another picture of what we're talking about. So we are all ex-members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, a cult throughout the Western world, 50,000 members. And what we're talking about specifically today is their own schooling system that they've set up for how many years now have they had it worldwide?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=827s)

Pretty much 20 years.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=829s)

Okay, so about 20 years. They've set up their own high school systems. It started high school and I believe they do elementary now. I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And their whole system is under what's called the OneSchool Global. So it's the church running everything about the school. And we're going to get into more and more details of that. So that's what you just heard, just to give you a picture.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=857s)

Yeah, and I think that the amount of teachers and principals that have started really landing on my inbox, obviously it's all anonymous, which I totally get. Most of them are bound by NDAs and we just need one. We just need one to break through and be brave and land on this podcast. The rest will follow. I don't believe in NDAs the way that everybody else does, but that's okay.

Anyhow, the biggest thing though is, is some of the shocking information that comes through [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=888s) the intensity of the bullying. And if anybody listened to Ros Atmore's podcast, you hear her account of her son that went through that kind of bullying. It's the bullying and this hierarchy system that happens. And, you know, I can sit here and from all the stories that have landed on my lap, I can sit here and tell Bruce that this anti-bullying program that he wants to install back into OneSchool Global is not going to work because these children are just replicating what they see.

And when you have the hierarchy, the way that the hierarchy is, they're just replicating what they're getting fed at home, right? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=930s) so you have these classes of people. We've got, you know, the top classes that make the most money, those top classes that are very much intertwined with Bruce because they're able to give him lots of money so he has them in his front pockets.

And then there's these people who are at the bottom of the hierarchy and those are the ones that are getting bullied. I had accounts of a principal talking to me about taking food to feed young ones that literally didn't, they came with just small little things of food and [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=961s) actually started bringing and giving them food. And I just think an anti-bullying program is not going to solve this problem. It's just like, how are you solving it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=973s)

They need to have an anti-bullying program in the church because that's where it comes from. They need to kick the bullies off the front row in their meeting halls. Then that'll start to affect the schools. But the whole PBCC runs on bullying, runs on coercive control, which is just a fancy word for bullying.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=994s)

These schools, religion with that much gender bias, male versus female, female can't speak and they're at the bottom of the totem pole. Any religion that has that much gender bias is doomed to fail.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1008s)

That's true. That's a good point, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1011s)

And I mean, a lot of this information I've gotten too is how they hire these junior teachers, right? So these are teachers that just come right out of school, they're needing work, and so they pick these very junior, green teachers that don't know how to speak up yet. The turnaround seems to be, from what I've been told, is a four-year turnaround. By year four, a lot of them have found their voice, they're speaking up against things, and then boom, they're gone, right?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1040s)

One thing I think that should raise a red flag right away about these schools is how small they are. Okay, these schools are, some of them in North America and Canada, are between 10 and 20 students. Now, why are you so small? That right away should raise a red flag. What are you protecting from? Well, it turns out they're protecting them, quotation marks, [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1070s) books, and from science, and from teaching things that they don't want taught, like human rights, like LGBTQ rights, right? They don't want their students to know that. These are the things that they're hiding from their students, trying to protect them from women's rights, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1092s)

We actually have, I'll share that. Don't we share the list of banned books?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1096s)

Yeah, yeah. I swear. And I think one of the biggest things, because I went to a OneSchool school in high school and I was forced to go. And one thing they just absolutely took out of everything was the idea of evolution. It just wasn't taught. Science was just skipped over. Right. And it's just like, that should be a crime.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1121s)

So this is from 2013, obviously. And from what I've heard, I can only imagine it's gotten a little bit more stricter, but I'll attach the link to this and we'll just kind of give a really quick brief view here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1135s)

It says 44 pages of banned books.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1138s)

It is. So it's way too much to go through in a, yeah, but scroll.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1141s)

Scroll down a bit because there's some very funny ones.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1144s)

I want to give one of the first ones in the list there to the listeners. Listening, one of the first books is "Introduction to Picasso." What the fuck? What did he do?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1155s)

Or even just the "Osborne Complete Book of Drawing." I mean, my daughter's an artist and she had all of these. And I'm sitting there and I was, when it first got sent to me, I was like, "How Artists Use Shape," "How Artists Use Perspective," "How Artists Use Color."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1172s)

You're banning these? Well, it's just because they've probably got some kind of nude illustration in it or something. You might actually find out what women have under their skirts.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1183s)

We had books to read in our fake little library at our tiny little school. I remember the National Geographic even had the topless women cut out. They cut out the pictures. I'm like, it's some indigenous woman in Brazil. What the hell are you doing?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1202s)

You'll probably find the trustees cut them out to put on their office wall. 

"Citizenship in Action." Well, they don't want you to know about that, do they?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1216s)

No, I mean, obviously I can see from, you know, being raised in there, why this was completely taken out because this gives them way too much power.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1224s)

"The Hardy Boys," though, that blew me away. Come on, "The Hardy Boys."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1229s)

Oh, yeah, I think there might have been a picture on the cover of a girl wearing trousers. So that would be unsuitable. That's right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1237s)

That's right. Women aren't allowed to wear pants in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which why, nobody knows. Beatrix Potter?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1247s)

Is there Beatrix Potter on there?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1247s)

It does say Beatrix Potter on there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1250s)

Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1253s)

Oh, I saw it. It was also a book about pirates. I'm like, come on.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1258s)

I mean, come to think of it, I don't think Peter Rabbit was wearing underpants in some of those pictures.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1264s)

A fish that grew legs?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1267s)

Well, that's evolution right there, right? Yeah, I know. They don't want you to know that one.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1275s)

"Giraffes Can't Dance." It's, I mean, there's pages and pages and pages of this. One of the stories that we're going to talk about today is the whole "King Lear," the "King Lear" book. And so we have an article from, it was from farther back, and then I talked to a teacher here just recently who had a more recent altercation with the "King Lear" book.

And you know, this teacher's perspective was that in "King [Lear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1310s)," there's some back talking that happens, right? I guess she said there's like backtalking happening. So she had matched up with somebody else to do this King Lear project. And the morning it was, the morning before or morning of, it was all of a sudden just taken off. So they don't get given guidelines. They don't have this list of banned books.

[They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1340s) she says they have to get their stuff together and they hope for the best. And in this case it was taken away. And she said, "But yet Hamlet is okay. It's got deep depression and suicide and that's okay, but books with talking back are not okay." And that just goes right along with Bruce Hales's whole theory that we're very much aware of, that he's really allowing in there, is that they're teaching them that it's okay, you know, you're better off to [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1370s) know, take your own life in there and go to heaven instead of leaving and go to hell.

So it made sense when she told me that. I knew exactly why that was allowed like that. But they, again, like not having guidelines, she said that they really don't have much communication, especially if you're a female, especially if you're a single female, not married. And the lead, communication is just horrible in there between them and the lead associate at the people at the top, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1403s)

And I can tell you why they don't have that book list. Because the Brethren know perfectly well that banned book lists are kind of symbolic of oppressive regimes and they don't want it leaked. Obviously, someone's leaked this. And so then they go and take away all the banned book lists and they only in the hands of the trustees rather than handing them out to the teachers because they don't want anyone to know they've got a banned book list. But too late.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1431s)

Do you know the Taliban use banned books lists? I'm pretty sure the Taliban are another group. I'm quite sure.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1436s)

They do, yeah. And the Nazis did, and communist Russia, and other nice people like that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1445s)

Exactly. Like, it blows my mind. And like, some of these books are just, "12th Day of July," really? Come on, like, they just blow my mind. And the only people that seem to be doing these kind of banning books is hardcore religious nuts that are like the Plymouth Brethren that are terrified of [sin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1477s) getting into the minds of their young people. No, it's called education. And it's going to teach them to question you. Yes, because why? Because they're not going to submit to your bullshit anymore. The new generation is getting smarter. They're learning to look things up for themselves, right? And so they have to try and, we have to ban internet, we have to ban books. Banning books, how low do you have to stoop?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1505s)

So this is an article that was written, this is from 2010, and this teacher, the title reads "Socked for teaching King Lear." I'll just read a brief synopsis of this. I won't go through it all. And at the top in bold it says "Brethren school also discourages university study, Joseph Barrett."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1526s)

Discourages? That's an understatement.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1528s)

I mean, it is much more than discourages. You're just not allowed. It's banned. It's completely banned. You would never find someone going in for a PhD in something. Yeah. So;

“Shakespearean tragedy has become high farce after a Christian high school sought a teacher for using a morally defiling King Lear text in class. Suzette Martin, 40\. (And Suzette, if you're listening to this, we'd love to have you on. I tried finding you and I couldn't find you.)

“Suzette Martin was sacked from the private Westmount school in Kerikeri for teaching her year 13 students from a modern version of the play. Fighting the dismissal at the Employment Relations Authority, she has revealed that her contract at the Exclusive Brethren School barred her from encouraging children to go onto university. The 15 Westmount schools received $2.59 million in government funding to teach 1,619 enrolled schools.”

And so this is, I want to just reiterate this too. When you guys, when people [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1586s) doing their taxes, like this is your tax money. Your tax money funds these people.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1592s)

Yes. How is it legal to even put that into a contract, to ban someone for encouraging them to seek higher education? That is literally what the Taliban does. Like, what is going on? Why are they like the Taliban?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1610s)

More on this later, yep.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1612s)

“Martin says she just wanted to do her best for her pupils, but the school argued she overstepped the line when she used the modern version of Shakespeare's play to fulfill NCAA requirements. She failed to clear it with the school committee and was dismissed. ‘I apologized and told them I had just been too busy, but they said it wasn't a good enough reason.’ The school committee found that the modern text was embarrassing, corrupting, and morally defiling.

Martin argued that Shakespeare's original approved King Lear text also contained offensive words, but the committee decided she had breached the ethos [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1642s) the school. The Employment Relations Authority expressed sympathy for Martin but said it was forced to uphold the dismissal. She intends to appeal the decision. ‘I am a results-orientated teacher,’ said Martin. ‘I just wanted what was best for their students and they needed more than just their approved test to pass their exam.’”

And this is kind of another thing that's landed in my conversations with teachers and principals is that they have a hard time with their PATs. Not only that, a lot of it too is that they don't have the [emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1672s) involvement in their stuff because, you know, a lot of the stories that have romance or they have all this emotional attachment to, they can't be a part of it, right? But the one teacher that I talked to just the other had said that they do poorly on their PATs.

“The single mom from Whangarei, I don't know how to pronounce that, said her dismissal from the school where she had worked since 2006 came as a shock. "I had a clean slate. I had never had a warning or been pulled about any issue," she said. Martin, who moved from India to New Zealand five years ago, has been unable to find a new job since her dismissal. ERA member Rosemary Monaghan said it was a very unfortunate dismissal. She said despite not condoning the restrictions in place at the school, she accepted the school's right to impose them.”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1721s)

They have a legal right to impose those kind of, like stopping of education?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1725s)

Yeah, I don't know. I really doubt it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1729s)

You know what, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. I had a teacher tell me that they openly admitted in a, I think it was a grad ceremony or something like that, something to do with grad, they openly admitted to bribing authorities in New Zealand to let them run schools the way that they wanted to. And the story in behind that I was told was quite, it was quite funny. Sad, but it was funny with how all the teachers were absolutely shocked that they were sitting there admitting this in front of everybody, you know. So I mean, and we know from being in there that this kind of stuff happens all the time, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1777s)

I mean, it is a bizarre thing that inside the Brethren, and I guess because there was a lot of parents there at a grad ceremony, they kind of felt this was a Brethren situation. They'll actually brag about breaking the law and brag about illegal stuff, and you actually get kind of brownie points for being a clever person who's managed to get around the authorities. And yet externally, they brag about how law-abiding they are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1803s)

Yeah, which we know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1804s)

I mean, actually, the next line on this article is very telling. It says, 

"Secondary Principals Association of New Zealand President Patrick Walsh said the dismissal was unfortunate, but Martin, in inverted commas, 'chose to take the job at that sort of school.'"

 Well, the message I would put out here to any teacher considering taking a job at one of these schools is no, you really do not want to take a job at that sort of school. [Never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1835s) mind if they're offering you slightly better pay, it's not going to look good on your resume. And it's not going to further your career.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1843s)

And their beliefs will seep into your life. They will try and it will just, yeah, don't take, don't even think about the money, even if they offer more, because it's just not worth it. They're gonna want you to censor what you say, how you dress, and every book that you want to show to those children is gonna have to go through these insane sensors and they're probably not gonna allow it. It's not worth it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1869s)

And from what I've heard is that OneSchool is not a good thing to have on your resume. It's actually looked at as that you actually had to compromise your own morals to work at these schools. And one teacher who, after was let go, thought, "Okay, well I have all this experience," and she had a lot of experience within OneSchool Global and went to apply and she didn't even get an interview. And then found [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1899s) later that, yeah, you don't want OneSchool Global on your resume. It's not looked at as a good thing because everybody out here knows you compromise your morals in order to work there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1910s)

Yeah, wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1912s)

Yeah. I'll attach the link to this. Yeah, it's an in-depth article. I'm not going to go through and read it all.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1933s)

What's the next thing on the list?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1935s)

What do we got here? I'm just... Here, I'll let you dive into this, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1947s)

Yeah, well, this was in the UK and this was just at this time that the Brethren lost the charitable status. So this was very high profile. 

"Police and government to investigate claim of child abuse at Brethren School."

 And it says,

 "A charitable school run by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is under investigation by the local council, the Department of Education, and the police after allegations of cruelty to children were made." 

And [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=1977s) the next article is a little more in depth.So, 

"Probe into strict Christian sect school that shut up girl pupil for 37 days for making a Facebook page." 

And it says, 

"School investigated over allegations of child cruelty and failure to teach the national curriculum. Alleged abuse includes the confinement of six pupils who set up a Facebook page. [Under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2012s) the rules, liaisons between pupils are also banned.

A fundamentalist Christian church at the centre of a multi-million pound dispute over charitable status is being investigated about claims of child cruelty. The Exclusive Brethren, which has 16,000 UK followers, has gained the support of more than 50 MPs in its bid to retain its charitable status and its entitlement to tax relief on donations. But [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2042s) newspaper has uncovered allegations of a shocking regime inside Exclusive Brethren schools, including pupils being confined at home for using the internet, elders tearing pages from textbooks to remove material about gay rights or sexually transmitted diseases, and teenage boys and girls being banned from talking to each other.

Yesterday, a local education authority confirmed it was investigating allegations of child cruelty and failures to teach the national curriculum at an Exclusive Brethren school in Wiltshire. Wilton Park School near Salisbury opened in September 2011 as an independent day school for boys and girls from age 11 to 18\. The probe by Wiltshire County Council, local police officers, and the Department of Education's due diligence team was triggered by a teacher at Wilton Park handing over a dossier [describing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2097s) the alleged abusers.

These claims include that punishments were imposed upon six pupils for setting up a Facebook page. Elders from the church are said to have responded so harshly because of the Exclusive Brethren's teachings on modern technology. Laptops are considered instruments of evil and internet access is tightly controlled to protect followers from defiling material. Pupils are also banned from emailing each other because, according to a school memo, such communications promote "special friendships" and are ‘beneath the dignity of our calling.’” 

(Dignity of their calling, my arse.)

“The dossier states that on the elder's instruction, six pupils were withdrawn, confined to their homes, and forbidden to have any communication with anyone outside their close families. Inside the Exclusive Brethren community, these [punishments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2153s) are called "shutting up." The teacher, who is not a member of the Exclusive Brethren, wrote, "As an employee, I've known of families that have been shut up for different lengths of time. I've never witnessed pupils being shut up before." The pupils were shut up between the months of May and July 2012\.

The only girl was shut up for the longest number of days and was recorded to have had 37 days off out of a possible 70 school days between May the 4th and July the 22nd, when the school term ended. All of her absences are recorded as authorised absences. She was not allowed to have any communication with anyone apart from her immediate family members, i.e. those whom she shared a house with. She suffered both [mentally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2198s) and physically from this controlled withdrawal from her friends. She lost weight and was emotionally distressed.

When it was decided that she would be allowed back to school, it was controlled by the EB, the Exclusive Brethren Elders. She was dropped off and escorted into a classroom. She remained there with work to do all day. She was not allowed to have contact with anyone apart from one or two teachers. They were not allowed to have any form of conversation with her unless it was study related. At the end of the day, she was picked up by a parent and taken home. She remained in her [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2228s) until the following school day.

A Brethren spokesman said, "Shutting up is not intended as a punishment, but is meant to encourage people to consider the consequences of their actions. Where young persons are involved, the decision is taken ultimately by their parents, though the advice of elders may be sought."

 Wow. What a lie. So untrue. Such liars. "The advice of elders may be sought." Yeah. So like, so yeah, so if a policeman kind of smashes into your house and arrests you, puts you in handcuffs and drags you off and puts you in a police cell, you would describe that as, "I was just seeking advice from the police." Yeah. I mean, what a lie.

The trustees, all Brethren, decide what is best for the school based on their religious and moral beliefs. They wouldn't know a moral if it bit them on the arse.

“The six pupils were in Wilton Park [sixth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2295s) form. These boys and girls aged 16 to 18 are subjected to gender segregation at all times to reflect the school's commitment to biblical values. Liaisons and relationships between pupils are prohibited and monitored using CCTV.

Other stipulations include teenagers being forbidden to attend university or public events such as premiership football matches. Pupils seldom play any competitive sport and have been banned from playing rugby by the church's Australian leadership. As the dossier compiled by the Wilton Park teacher reads, "The sixth form boys at the school are a very athletic group and they wanted to start playing full contact rugby. They put forward a very articulate and well thought through presentation as to why they felt this was necessary. The [trustees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2341s) told them they would come back with an answer within 24 hours."

Their answer as dictated to them by "Australia,"

 (And we know that when the Brethren say Australia they mean Bruce Hales) 

“...was clear that full contact rugby should not be played as it "promotes savagery." So for Exclusive Brethren schools in the UK, decisions are no longer made locally or even nationally.”

( Well, that's true. I was a trustee and everyone knows that.)

“Teaching staff at Wilton Park must also abide by strict codes of conduct and dress as set out by the school. Female staff wear dresses or skirts at least knee length and clothing must be modest and not revealing or low cut. Male teachers must have short hair and shave.

The launch of the investigation comes just weeks before the Exclusive Brethren's appeal against the charity [commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2398s) is heard by a legal tribunal. The commission recently decided the church did not qualify for charitable status.”

 Yeah, I think that's probably the juice of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2409s)

Yeah. And I mean, it is. And they should have never gotten their charity status back. Everything that they, I mean, if you sit there and listen to Jackie Hart's podcast that we did, and she also did one with James DiFiore a while ago, right? They came out with this whole thing about, you know, what they had to agree to. And to the outside world, it looks like they're adhering to this, but they're not. They're not adhering to it whatsoever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2437s)

Well, the interesting thing is I was in the Brethren when all this was going down and I saw what happened in the local school in Cambridge in response to this, and it triggered absolute panic. Suddenly, they had all these censored textbooks with pages pasted over and pages glued together. Suddenly they had to have a massive expense. They had to chuck away all the censored textbooks and buy new textbooks. They had to replace all the censored textbooks just overnight because they knew they were being investigated by the Department of Education.

And it's absolutely true about this. There's a further article where the Brethren deny that there's a segregation of male and female [students,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2479s) but that was absolutely true. And they did all that. You couldn't sit, you know, a boy and girl couldn't sit next to each other at the same desk. Their break times were segregated. So first they would have the school break for the boys and then they'd have the school break for the girls. They can't play PE. PE is completely segregated. And then they kind of backed off on that again, because they thought they were going to be investigated. So this caused a real panic right through the UK. And, you know, they had to spend a whole lot of [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2509s) just trying to paper over the cracks.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2513s)

Well, and one of the things that jumps right out there is the girl was treated different than the boy. So right there in the article, you can see the gender bias. The girl had to stay home for, what was it, 37 days. The girl got shut up and the boys still went to school. You tell me there's not gender bias? That is full-blown gender bias, as loud and as clear as you can say. And that's how it starts. That's how the girls are treated in school. And it just gets louder and prouder as their age goes on.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2545s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2547s)

It's evil.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2549s)

It is. Like I went to the school in Montreal and I remember the teachers, some teachers getting pulled out during class and then coming back and being like, "Okay, we're not continuing with that lesson." And it was, I can't remember what it was. It was science related though. And I was like, this is insane. Like, what do you mean we can't go on with that?

Also, we were back [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2579s) we were forced bible study, which I didn't know, I was an atheist back then, so that's forced religion on me. No, I'm kidding. But like, it was, that was like a serious class as we all had to take bible class. And I remember the teacher also got in trouble, our math teacher, because we had to do up a budget based on living in a one-bedroom apartment, having a car lease and everything and paying rent.

And the kids objected [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2609s) they were like, "We'll never have to do this," and one of them complained to the parents and sure enough it came back. And I was blown away and he was like, "No, everyone needs to know how to do this," and they were like, "No, no, we're never gonna have to do that." I remember there was 14 kids in my school, like that's insanity. And there was 12 in my class. So that means, yeah, I can do a little bit of math, but that means there was a class with two kids. Like that's awful.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2639s)

I remember, yeah, gym class was actually taught by a real phys ed teacher, which was good. But we were so limited in what the girls could wear during sports and phys ed. They weren't allowed to wear pants. So they had to wear like leggings, like underskirts and stuff. It was just a huge pain in the neck every time we wanted to do sports. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2663s)

Yeah. Okay, let's just go through some of our articles that we have pulled up here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2672s)

I mean, just one comment on that Wilton Park School. You see the cruel way this girl was treated, the way she was escorted on and off the premises, isolated in her own classroom and so on. That's bullying. So no wonder you get students bullying each other when the whole ethos of the school is based on bullying. That's how Brethren control each other.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2695s)

And it seems like they pretend to justify it by saying, "Oh, the elders and the family gets involved." Just because the family and the elders agreed to bully someone doesn't make it right. You're ostracizing a child. You're separating a child from their social life. That's evil. That's total bullying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2717s)

The cruelest thing you could do.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2719s)

Yeah, and how can you come up with an anti-bullying program when everything about your hierarchy, everything about your structure represents bullying? You're against women, you're separating children, and you're separating girls from boys. They can't speak to each other. Everything about the way you're structured is a bunch of bullies. And you're going to come up with an anti-bullying program? What you are is so loud, nobody's going to hear what you're saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2749s)

Yep, and I mean Bruce is the biggest bully of them all. Right? It's what he does with the power he has is a complete narcissistic bully that just gaslights everything. You know, I wanted to bring up something really quick here while I'm thinking about it. Is one of the conversations that I had was about how every Thursday morning these boys would show up to grade 12 hung over, sunglasses on, and [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2779s) brag about how drunk they got. And these are underage kids, right?

I think this is what I'm just talking about is like there's such mixed messages inside their structure of what they're, inside their ecosystem has a lot of flaws, right? I mean, they're talking about how to prove how their culture is good, but you know what, for number one, the alcohol, you should be turning that whole system into a dry out center. Everybody should be drying out. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2810s) mean, some of the stories you hear of people who won't go to other people's houses just because there's not alcohol there. I mean, people are trying to not have alcohol in there. And yet it's just put on you that the more you drink is the closer you are to God.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2822s)

They're in hell. They're in hell in their own minds. And the only way to tame it down is alcohol.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2827s)

Well, if you drink enough, you'll probably meet God fairly soon.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2833s)

And you know, I had somebody from inside who had messaged me recently who, this insider had said like, that's how they numb, that's how they numb their pain is through the alcohol. That's how you survive in there is the alcohol. I mean, if you were to take the alcohol away, it would crumble. The whole thing would crumble, right? It is alcohol is what keeps that going because you know, it's an escapism for them.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2857s)

And you won't very often hear me quote my grandpa's timing too because I didn't agree with a whole lot of what he said, but one thing he did say, he said, "What you are is so loud I can't hear what you're saying."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2871s)

That's, I like that. I like that one.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2874s)

Amen. That's all I said.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2879s)

I actually, I'm gonna go back, well I just want to go to some of the reviews here while we're kind of on this, their culture that they're trying to prove good. These are some reviews that Carman found.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2898s)

“Ever moving goalposts, no room for progression, inconsistent staff treatment, no job security for members of staff at all levels. They will disappear overnight without an explanation.”

 Amazing. That's just like the students. They will disappear overnight into a 37-day at-home shut-up period. 

“Constantly changing the way they teach. Very poor leadership.”

 Well, that's in the church too.

“They think they're innovative, but far from it. There's poor job security, good with technology and good kids, but that's where it ends. They really think they are cutting edge, but sadly far from it. I spent eight years there, each one getting worse.”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2950s)

I think that's funny. I think that part's really funny because they really do sometimes think that they're cutting edge and like really advanced and stuff. And it's hilarious because they're so far from it. They're 50 years behind.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2965s)

HR does not take issues seriously due to the bureaucracy of the organization. Exactly what we've been talking on. Reviews are not based on performance. There are no consequences for discrimination against employees or for supervisors that create hostile environments.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=2986s)

And the title on that one is hilarious. It's called "Think Twice." Think twice. And I do. I mean, from everybody that's landed in my inboxes and I've talked on the phone, that is it. I mean, seriously, think twice before you sign up with these people thinking that, you know, "Oh, well, they've hired you and you're young and you're first just out." Yeah, no, it's not what you think it is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3011s)

Yeah, it was very interesting on the previous podcast we did where the schools, two of the schools had visited the Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg and they had asked for displays to be censored so that you couldn't see displays about LGBTQ rights or women's rights. And the comment that the Brethren spent probably millions of dollars and two years and a [300,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3041s) was it 600 page report by a top lawyer, Gerald Chipeur.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3046s)

3,000 pages. Oh, yeah, I was going to say 3,000 pages.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3050s)

Wow, that's a telephone directory. And all this legal activity was to try and prevent the names of the schools being published. And the reason that their lawyer gave why they didn't want the names of the schools published is that it would make it difficult for them to recruit staff. And that actually was the only honest thing he said. And it is true because people don't want to work for this kind of school. You have to sell your soul to the devil.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3081s)

They couldn't find a lawyer in Winnipeg, in North Dakota. They couldn't find one even in Manitoba, not even in Saskatchewan. They had to go all the way to Calgary, Alberta to get a lawyer that thought enough like them to represent them. And he got a two-year case. Imagine what his bill is. Two-year case and 3,000 pages. Oh my word.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3108s)

And I mean, if anybody is not familiar with Chipeur, well, just Google his name and tie it in with exclusive... Yeah, just Google it and then add in PBCC and Exclusive Brethren, you'll get it all.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3121s)

And then if you want to go down the conspiracy rabbit hole, look at a picture of Pierre Poilievre and see if it looks like his son, you know? Just saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3133s)

Okay.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3134s)

Okay, this one.

 "The school does not value the time or expertise of its employees. Because they are a private school, they take advantage of any local laws that allow them to place any teacher into any subject. For instance, rather than have a teacher with a degree in teaching math, teach math, they will have them teach English, science, etc. They do this out of convenience for themselves. It's easier to coerce the math teacher to teach English than it is to hire a proper [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3164s) teacher.

The lack of appreciation or value of the teacher's expertise, the ignoring of our field of degrees, and pushing us into subjects that we are not qualified to teach. This decision strongly negatively impacts the students and the effects of it are seen heavily. As most students are very poor in basic grammar, spelling, and math, and as a result of many English teachers, elementary teachers, not having a degree in the field of elementary teaching."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3196s)

I can witness to that because I was a trustee of the Regina school and they had two teachers and the teachers just had to teach all the subjects, including the subjects that they had no qualification in at all.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3212s)

"Prior to 2018 the school did not have a system in place for administering raises each year. I can only speak to how teachers were given raises but previously teachers could petition for a raise each year based on merit and sometimes earned a raise of $10k to $15k at once. In 2018, the school created a legitimate HR department, which decided teachers could only earn a 2% raise each year and merit could never count into the salary of a teacher. This difference led to huge income disparities between teachers, which the school attempted to hide from all new hires." And I can already tell you what that is. The women got paid half what the men did.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3251s)

Yeah, I'll bet. Wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3255s)

"The school heavily overworks its staff. It overworks its people at home, too. So every employee was assigned multiple roles within the school. For instance, a campus principal might be the campus secretary and the campus art teacher and the campus business teacher. This led to many staff members being put into positions for which they were not qualified for and being overworked. The special education program is unfortunate and does not properly serve students with qualified support."

This is my favorite line in this review. 

"[Overall,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3286s) the school runs more like a business than a school." Overall, I could change that with only changing one word. "Overall, the church runs more like a business than a church." So they're consistent that way.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3298s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3299s)

"They place a higher emphasis on using their money efficiently in terms of staffing than they do on choosing high quality professionals for any given position. The organization has excellent values, but their system of overworking and undervaluing staff is not sustainable and leads to very high turnover rates within the school. Advice to management: value your staff more highly, spend less money on fancy new [rebranding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3329s) and new furniture and having nice paint on the walls. Instead, spend more money on each campus, the level of staff they need to function at a sustainable and healthy rate."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3342s)

Now, a very interesting comment there is that we understand that OneSchool Global schools are coerced into purchasing very expensive educational furniture from businesses owned by the Hales family at exorbitantly overpriced rates. And they're just told you need, you know, 300 new special ed desks or something. And so this is a very simple money [laundering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3372s) tactic whereby money that grassroots Brethren donate to the school for the education is actually laundered through the sale of overpriced furniture directly into the pockets of Gareth Hales and Bruce Hales and their friends. That makes a lot more sense now.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3391s)

So do you think that'll continue now they sold that business?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3394s)

Oh, no, they've still got a finger in it. Yeah, they've still got a finger in it. The next scam, and this is the prophet speaking, Prophet Muhammad, not the other one. The next massive money laundering scam that the Hales family are about to perpetrate on OneSchool and the Brethren is that they are just about to demand that all the schools get brand new and extremely expensive computer and software systems for all the students and the teachers and everything else. And if you follow the money back, you will find that those computers will be supplied by a company in which the Hales family have a very deep financial interest. [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3436s) this space.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3440s)

Wow. I want to add to this, too. Some of the conversations that I've had have also led to these young green teachers, like literally schools being run by just 24-year-olds, right? And them not having their full cert, like teaching before they're fully certified. And what was supposed to happen is on the other end of the Zoom calls or everything that they collaborate with, there would be a certified teacher there that's overseeing it, but it never happened.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3467s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3468s)

Another thing that I just want to really quick bring up is on the topic of money, is consistent reports being brought back to me about money that the children, the kids raise for certain things, all of a sudden going missing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3484s)

Oh yeah, no, I heard about that when I was in, when I was in the Brethren. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, we won't say where it was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3493s)

Yeah, and I mean, not just once. It's like it was multiple times. The one conversation I had just yesterday was quite substantial, right? It was like, it was over 10 grand. And I mean, that's how disappointing and how heart wrenching it must be for those kids who have to, you know, sit there and work their butts off raising this money for either whether it's grad, whether it's a trip, whatever it is, right? And then that money to be all [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3523s) a sudden gone.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3525s)

Let's say stolen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3527s)

Oh, 100 percent. It was stolen. Absolutely. Yeah. Stolen by the church.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3531s)

Yeah, and someone sent me the math recently that they did on the donations that Bruce Hales gets every month in care-meetings and they, I think they averaged it out to about six million a year. So that's just on that, that's just, you know, on those simple little donations that he gets once a month from different Brethren cities.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3550s)

Yeah, tax free, of course.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3552s)

Yeah, yeah, tax free. Six mil, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3555s)

So I just wanted, I want the listeners to understand too that we're not reading, these are not reviews from way back when. This next one Carman's going to read is literally from July 31st, 2021, and the title is "Avoid\!\!\!"

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3572s)

Teacher in London, England. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3575s)

And these are publicly available things too. Like people need to understand these are posted on Glassdoor. These are posted on Indeed. So if you think we made them up, just go look it up, they're there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3588s)

OneSchool Global on any hiring site, read the reviews.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3593s)

"The teaching staff have no voice. All decisions are made above without regard of how things actually work in the classroom. Constant changes in pedagogy. The behavior of the older students is generally ignored or not dealt with. The teachers are undermined by senior leaders. Most staff feel there is no job security. If your face doesn't fit, you disappear. Lots of examples of constructive dismissal [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3623s) bullying."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3625s)

That's bullying of staff by the trustees. So that's where that comes from. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3632s)

Wow. "Poor communication in all aspects. Staff do not feel valued. There's lots of paper pushing with no benefit to the teachers or the students. Advice to management: Listen to your teachers. They know what is best for the students they teach. When you send out a questionnaire, actually look at the answers and deal with the issues that are being raised. Don't pick and choose to deal with the girls but not the boys. Constant changes are unsettling for the students and staff. [Communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3662s) needs to be greatly improved between regional principals and teachers. Spend money on necessities like staff and resources rather than rebranding and pointless national conferences at NEC."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3678s)

Hilarious, that's funny. Man, this, like their whole schooling thing, we need to get some reporters to go and like check out the schools because they're technically public schools kind of, aren't they?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3694s)

A lot of them, a lot of them are funded with taxpayer money. That's the real scandal.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3700s)

So they should be, so reporters should be allowed to go in and look and just check out these books. See if you find any pages with huge black marker through them like mine was. You know, and pages glued together or page 124 and then 127, you're like, what's going on here?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3717s)

Think about it. Some of those students might be hiding Beatrix Potter under their bed, under their mattress, reading it secretly at night by flashlight.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3726s)

And if you're a Brethren member and you're listening and you're a young person, the reason they don't want you to learn certain information is because you will see through the bullshit. You will eat the apple that Eve ate and you will magically get information that will go, "Oh my goodness, they're full of shit." That's what they're trying to hide from you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3752s)

All right. “ 2.0, no job security. Difficult to rate. On the surface, they see themselves as modern and go-getting, but in practice, they limit their staff by forcing constant change on them. There are good ideas, such as the push to self-directed study, but as the schools are run by a closed religious community, teachers are limited in what they can teach, and the students aren't allowed to go to university making it feel like your job is redundant. No job security as people disappear overnight [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3782s) no explanation."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3783s)

Why does that keep coming up? "Overnight." I mean, it kind of sounds like sort of Eastern Germany in the communist era where, you know, people just disappear overnight.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3795s)

Or Tony Soprano, you know, "He don't work here no more."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3800s)

And paid off. Like I had, I don't have that note in front of me, but literally there was, yeah, someone was paid out to not come back. And yeah, so I mean, and then they close these teachers and principals in with these, you know, big long-winded NDAs that make them fearful of saying anything. And what I'm telling you is that no, if you get enough people together, and you know, you can all end up in my inbox. That's okay. We'll I'll get you [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3830s) together and we'll do this all together.

We'll come forward as this big, huge podcast. We'll all do it together. It's, to me, it's more important to help these children. I am so much about the children. I think that's why I did day home for so long. It's just, that's your future generation. These are our future generations. These are our nieces and our nephews. These are those people in there that I think if enough people come together, there is a huge, [significant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3861s) change that we can make to free these kids. And I mean, I'm not saying that we have to take the PBCC down, and that's not what I'm saying, but it needs the chains that are on there, the locked doors that they're in behind, that has to go.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3875s)

And if they're not going to change, there is no way they should be getting government funding.Taxpayers don't want their money being used for this kind of crap.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3884s)

Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3886s)

It should be a crime to withhold information about certain sciences in school, right? Like these are fundamental things. They're being withheld from information and human rights. Like the fact that they don't teach them about rights, you know, that should be illegal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3904s)

Look at the title on this one. This title, literally 1.0, "Run for the hills\!" And it's from September 10th, 2021\. So still again, very recent.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3915s)

And this is United Kingdom. So this is for all our friends over there. You know, that hits pretty close over there. "This company felt like they are cutting edge, but in reality, they moved the goalposts almost daily. The workload is unrealistic and management in head office is appalling. They pretend to listen but then stab you in the back as quick as they look at you. Unprofessional behavior and, (oh here we go again) people just seem to [disappear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3945s)."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3945s)

No word of warning, just gone. This is so mafia-like. It's freaking me out here. Like, where do they go? Are we sure they're okay? Is anyone checking on these people?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3958s)

Yeah, where are the bodies buried?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3960s)

James would have a heyday with this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3962s)

Well, I know their meeting halls have got their own graveyards, maybe their schools do too.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3970s)

Maybe it's Brad Mitchell and he's, you know, he's getting his biker gang together again.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3975s)

If this said Canada, I would think it was talking about Maple Creek because that's what happened to the young people. They just disappeared. Just, they got thrown out on the street, disappeared. And long hours, no work balance, poor CPD, awful management, unrealistic expectations, ever-changing goalposts.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=3995s)

It seems like the Lord just seems to turn corners at an awful high rate.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4001s)

Donuts in the road.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4007s)

This is a race course. Okay, rough with the smooth. "The biggest concern for teachers during my time at the school was job security. It was commonplace for friends and colleagues,( here we go again) to disappear overnight and the non-disclosure agreements to not be able to speak about it. Not exactly a paragon for transparency or integrity."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4037s)

Holy cow. In a Christian school?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4038s)

“On one occasion, a head teacher, highly liked by those who worked with them, called a staff meeting on a Friday with a member of the community so that the staff were able to air their concerns. Head teacher did not return after the weekend.”

 Oh, no.

"Behavior of the students can be challenging here like elsewhere too, as students have historically been able, but unilateral decisions on staff firing. And so teaching staff became aware of the hierarchy unlike any other within the sector. Students tend to be amenable one-on-one but in groups could be divisive and uncooperative so treading the discipline tightrope often left teachers teetering on the brink and disappearing [socially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4101s) speaking."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4104s)

Yeah, it's cut off. People might have to actually look this one up. Part of the sentences are cut off. I mean, you kind of get the gist of it, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4113s)

Yeah, yep. Yeah. “Improve communication and relations between national leadership and local teams. An approach which works in Australia might necessarily be suited for Canada or UK in this case.”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4131s)

The sad thing too is that Brethren members don't actually have a choice about sending their children to this school, right? If you chose to not send your children to the school, the entire church would turn against you. You'd be ostracized. You'd be picked on, bullied. Yeah. So you have to send your kids to the school. And we want to let these people know that you're not getting your money's worth.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4161s)

No, but this school is specifically made to make them into businessmen and women into housewives, right? Like it's not created, this school is not meant to build you into something that's going to go out and conquer something, right? The men are literally created into being these businessmen and women are, you know, to cook, clean, and have babies and be submissive.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4190s)

Yeah. All right. “ Disorganized. The pros were it's a small staff at each campus, usually meant that they were tightly knit. The cons were I had three bosses, a campus boss local, an academic boss Northland, and an administrative boss in Auckland, and they never communicated with each other and the teachers messages all the time, and then the other one is high turnover."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4219s)

Yeah, they seem to have an insane amount of turnover.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4222s)

Yeah. "Caring but dismissive. The cons are progression is next to none, no structured role, they're spread thin, they're very slow at noticing capacity issues and resolving them, they're penny pinchers. Advice to management: expand IT more than current, the budget doesn't match reality when it comes to the IT staff."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4250s)

That's because they spend tons of money not on IT so that these young people can learn to code and learn to be developers in the cyberspace. No, no, no. They spend all this money on Streamline 3 and running firewalls that block your access to real information, right? They want to treat you. If you really look at it, these [programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4280s) that they're using, Brethren members, to put on your computers are parental controls that in the real world, people use for children. And they're using them on you guys. So just think about that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4296s)

The other thing that comes out of this is they obviously spend a lot of money on rebranding. And I think we can understand that. That is, I mean, OneSchool Global has got this awesome and very impressive website. And the whole reason they're doing all this rebranding is just like the RRT, they're trying to make a facade that hides the reality. And they've got two reasons for that. One, they want to retain their government funding. And secondly, they're desperately trying to recruit [teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4326s) and teachers just don't want to work there. So as with the cult itself, as with the religion, there's a whack of money going into PR to put up a false facade that hides the rather ugly reality of what OneSchool is all about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4342s)

And I think that's why it's so important if, like, we can find some brave ex-teachers and ex-principals to come forward. And I mean, I just, I hate saying it like this, but if we truly care about this, you kind of get through that fear-mongering and get to the actual action that needs to happen. In this case, we need to expose this stuff so we can get investigated.

I know you're bound by NDAs, I know that everybody's fearful of stepping out and being the first one. Speaking from experience, it is, it's hard. It is hard. But I can guarantee you that if just one person comes forward, everybody else will because this does need to be investigated. Their schools [need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4385s) to be investigated.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4386s)

And if you, even if you feel you've got to remain anonymous, that's fine. We can still publish what needs to be published.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4393s)

Yeah, yeah. If you're not, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4394s)

You know, if you want us to keep your identity confidential, absolutely we will. We have to do this stuff all the time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4400s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4400s)

We're experts at keeping things confidential. I wouldn't be alive otherwise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4404s)

Okay, so we were gonna touch on this subject about being held back from university.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4415s)

Well, like when I went to join the military, you know, I showed up with my high school diploma and they were like, "Yeah, where's your transcripts?" right? So right there, that shows you that by the way, if you go to OneSchool and you ever try and probably get a government job, that piece of paper might just be a piece of shit. It might be nothing. So I had to do a GED just to get in, just to get into the military, right? And so [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4455s) how much they suppress further education. It's a crime that I never, you know, was able to go to a school that allowed me to get the credits to go on to CEGEP in Quebec or on to university.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4471s)

Right. Yeah. So what you're saying is that even if you were to, say you left the Brethren and then try and attend university, you won't be able to get in because the university won't recognize your grades.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4484s)

Exactly. Like you'd have to apply maybe as a mature student and write an application. But yeah, generally speaking, you do not have that option after because you just don't have anything for them to go off of. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4496s)

But apart from which, the only way you could go to university is if you were to leave your Brethren, your family, everyone you ever knew first, because if you tried to do it while you're in there, they would kick you out. Yeah. So I mean, this headline, this really hit me when it came up in the newspapers on the news sites a few weeks ago. "United Nation condemns the Taliban decision to bar women from universities."

And of course, all the Western nations are horrified about this, you know, shock horror, look what the Taliban's done. But the Brethren have been doing this for the last 60 years. My father who's just passed away in his late 80s or early 90s was about one of the last people in the Brethren to actually attend university because back in the 1960s, suddenly it was stopped. Persons who had even [completed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4547s) their studies at university left without graduating.

And persons, and this is hard to believe, but this is actually in printed ministry, persons who had obtained a degree were told by the leader at the time, James Taylor Jr., to put their degrees in the toilet and piss on them. And a lot of them literally did. They actually put their university degrees in the toilet and peed on them. When I was a kid, I was going through the attic space in [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4578s) parents' house where I lived. I was about seven or eight. And I found this old earthenware jar right at the back corner and I went through it and much to my interest it contained all my parents' love letters, which are rather sweet, and my father's university degree, which still appeared to be dry and intact.

So obviously he very naughtily kept it. But again, I was looking through some of his old papers and I found articles [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4608s) brochures, scientific brochures he was a physicist, research brochures that were published in the name of Dr. David Marsh back in the early 60s. And then a few years later, further publications that were made in which he was just called David Marsh because he wasn't going to take the title of doctor, although he was entitled to. So I mean, that's just so sad.

But yeah, so coming back to it's astonishing, the outrage. And you [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4639s) countries even like Turkey and Saudi Arabia condemning the Taliban for banning women for going to universities. And at the same time, in our wonderful Western democracies like Canada and USA and UK and France, you've got the government funding schools that ban anyone from going to university, not just women, but anyone. And this is government funded. This should not be happening. And politicians are taking donations from these [people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4669s) Exactly, they're being bribed. I mean, that's exactly what we were saying earlier, like the Brethren admitted to bribing New Zealand authorities to run the schools the way they wanted. So I mean, I just pulled up this article, I just wanted to read what the United Nations said about the Taliban and just let's apply that to OneSchool.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4690s)

Exactly. Like literally on here saying, "asking the authorities to immediately revoke the decision," like this needs to happen with the PBCC. I do not get how human rights here in even just North America, right, or even in the UK, like more in these Commonwealth countries, is that this should have been taken care of back when they had, yeah, it should have been, absolutely.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4714s)

Canada prides itself, and rightly so, on being right at the forefront of human rights. Yet Canadian provincial governments are funding these schools that ban university attendance. This is what the United Nations said about the Taliban. Let's just apply this to the Brethren. "Clear and present violation. United Nations human rights High Commissioner Volker Turk described the ban as another appalling and cruel blow to the [rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4744s) of Afghan women and girls and a deeply regrettable setback for the entire country."

Reminding that their systematic exclusion from virtually all aspects of life is "unparalleled in the world,"... (and I might add, except of course in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church) “...he upheld that banning women from tertiary education is all the more heartbreaking when considering their vital contributions over the years. "Coming on top of girls being barred from attending secondary [school,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4775s) just think of all the female doctors, lawyers and teachers who have been and who will be lost to the development of the country," said the senior UN official.”

 Well, how many doctors, lawyers and teachers have the Plymouth Brethren produced in the last 50 years? None.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4791s)

Zero. Exactly. How many amazing inventions? How many public records? How many great scientists? Yeah, they say they have amazing musicians in the Brethren. Let us hear them. Why are you like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4803s)

“He stated that suspending women from tertiary and higher education is in clear violation of Afghans' obligations under international law, adding that their rights to access all levels of education without discrimination is fundamental and unquestionable.” 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4829s)

That's the United Nations, guys. That's the United Nations.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4831s)

We need to contact the premiers and the education department, so those provinces that still fund these schools, and ask them why the double standard here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4841s)

I agree. I 100% agree.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4845s)

Of course, the Brethren claim that, "Oh, yes, no, of course, students can attend university, you know, if that's what they choose to do." What they don't say is if they do make that choice, they will be thrown out of the system and they will be cut off from their family and from their friends and from everyone they've ever known.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4865s)

Yeah. And also they get around it by saying that they can attend university now. But what they mean is they can do certain university courses that only are online, right? But they can't take any like science course online or degree in anything. It has to be certain things like business, I think is allowed, and other things like that. And they can't go to a graduation ceremony. You know, they can't go and have their gown and their cap. That's completely forbidden.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4889s)

And the Brethren also offer an online ABM, they call it course, Advanced Business Management, which they claim is university level and will cost every student who does it, it will cost them $10,000 to take this course. And then they issue a certificate, which is just garbage because it's not recognized. The only [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4919s) who recognize it are Brethren businesses.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4921s)

I wish Brethren people would understand this simple concept that just because someone is rich doesn't mean that they're smart. A good businessman does not necessarily mean a good economist, right? So think about this course being put together by a bunch of rich guys. Sure, that sounds great, but none of them actually have any education, right? Like this is a made up course. They're just printing fake certificates. I mean, I can get one online too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4953s)

Well, I mean, a lot of things come from Mr. Hales too, right? There's somebody that we're going to bring on to our podcast, we're just lining things up, and she's got a lot to reveal in that where she witnessed these fake courses being taken and they're not real. They're just handed down from Bruce's regime and they're made to feel real inside there, right? But out here in the world, yeah, they mean nothing.

I guess it's just Bruce that I reiterate again, Bruce [knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=4983s) what he is doing. He knows what he is doing. He knows how his, like his system isn't broken. It's literally working the way that he needs it to, to keep this 55,000 people completely underneath his thumb. I can tell you, Bruce, that by the amount of people that come into my inbox, you got some cracks. And if you want to sit down and talk to me about those cracks, I'm very open to it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5013s)

I really hope he does come in on the podcast. I've also got, did I tell you guys I did up a workout regime for Mr. Bruce Hales? Oh, did you? That's awesome. Yeah. So, Mr. Bruce, if you're listening, I want you to start with one push-up and one sit-up, and then get back to me and we'll go on to the next workout.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5039s)

He can't do a chin up because he wouldn't know which chin to go by.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5042s)

Changing topics here, one thing I did want to go over because I was listening to the previous podcast is how they call people "mental" in the Brethren. They love to do that, right? And that's just their dismissal. Someone's leaving the church or someone wants to leave. "Oh, they're mental. They're mental." So to the Brethren members listening, because I was called that a lot when I was in there, too. My brother and my parents love to call [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5072s) mental.

And turns out, not just crazy, but the real term, there's no actual medical term for "mental." So the real term that they're trying to say, I think, is psychosis. And what it means, it's kind of ironic because what it means is losing contact with reality. So let's give an example. Maybe if somebody refused to stop believing in Santa Claus, that would be losing contact with reality, or believing in an eternal torture chamber. [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5103s) you go. If you think I'm going to be going to an eternal torture chamber, I'll let you know, you might be psychotic.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5112s)

Yeah, that's a very potent point, Lane. Thank you for that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5115s)

It is. And it is good. I mean, and when you listen to Ros's podcast, it was just incredible. She's such a, she's gosh, she's gone through so much. What a sweetheart. And I think if you are being labeled with these words, maybe take that word "mental" and take what they're telling you and maybe realize that you're shaking off the chains of Bruce and that there is [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5145s) very uncomfortable stage of shaking off those chains because you're literally walking away from something that you've been indoctrinated to believe since you were born.

And it is, it's not an easy thing to do. It isn't. Especially for moms, especially if you had a lot of trauma growing up there. It is this transition that you have to take and it is going to look messy. But maybe just reframe it in your mind that it is your brain literally [losing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5175s) reality of the chains that you had to be indoctrinated to believe that are false. It's not true. What Bruce Hales teaches is not truth.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5185s)

And the trauma, the mental trauma you experience is the process of unpicking all those lies and coming to terms with reality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5196s)

Yeah. And I mean, and we're going to bring Jill Miytton back on and go through some, I've been meaning to reach out to her again because I've had emails coming in about different therapies that have worked for different people because there is, I mean, therapy for myself has been a game changer. It has been life-saving. I get many people messaging me asking what therapy that I did. And for me, it was, it's even from inside, I literally even had people from inside asking what therapy I've done.

And so that is going to be another podcast [we'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5226s) dive in and go through some of the different therapies that have worked for people who have left. The freedom is worth the chaos. That's all you have to know. If you need to write that somewhere, write that somewhere. The freedom is worth the chaos. Much like, you can't even put into words the exhilarating feeling of waking up in the morning knowing that you have nobody to prove anything to but yourself.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5256s) just remember the freedom is well worth the chaos that you have to go through. Yes, it hurts to leave the family. I mean, I've had conversations just this week with some people that are really struggling with losing family. It is hard. But if we take what we hurt from and use it as energy, use it as power to motivate you to make the changes we need. That's what you have to learn how to do. Yes, we grieve. Yes, we get angry. Yes, we have all these emotions that come up and these uncomfortable [feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5287s) that we have. Let them come up and use it as a form of fuel to be like, "What can I do to make changes?" Because that to me is what is going to free the people that we've left inside, is by using your voice, using your power to utilize this change that has to happen.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5307s)

Yep. Well said. Before we go, I wanted to do a quick thing. I wanted to give some book recommendations. So I have two books I want to recommend to people that are readers. One is "On Having No Head" by Douglas Harding. And he was actually an ex-member of the Plymouth Brethren. And he had this epiphany when he was walking through the mountains of India after leaving the Brethren. And it's a really interesting book. The second book is called "Waking Up" by Sam Harris. If you have Audible, I recommend you listen to it on that because [Sam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5341s) narrates his own book and he has this great speaking voice. Yeah, I just found those books very helpful. And in "Waking Up," he actually references Douglas Harding's book. So it's kind of cool.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5353s)

Wow. Okay, we'll add links to those. I'm in the middle of diving into John Spinks's book and oh yeah, I'm excited to, I want to reach out to him and see if he'll come on here. Yeah, he's, it's an incredible...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5369s)

What's the title of it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5370s)

"Escape."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5371s)

Okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5372s)

It's called "Escape," yeah. And he actually has it, he goes through on YouTube and does like some chapter by chapter and reads parts of it. It's very interesting, but very, very unique individual, very captivating. Yeah. Cool. So that's it for our first stab at OneSchool Global. We'll be back with more. This will be an ongoing conversation. I'm hoping it inspires ex-teachers and ex-principals to kind of come [forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5402s). If you have to do it anonymous, that's fine. info.getalife@proton.me is where you'll reach all of us.

And we would love to have conversations with you. And it can be behind the scenes and we just bring the information forward if that's how we have to start. Eventually though, I really, really hope we find somebody who is ready and willing to come on and talk.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5425s)

And not just teachers. We take students too. Oh, absolutely. If you've got crazy stories.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5430s)

Absolutely. Even if you're inside, I mean, I get lots of emails from people inside. If you're a student inside, feel free to email me, give me some of your crazy stories. Yeah, we'll put them on here.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5445s)

We have a job for our listeners too, don't we?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gibprF-pCqM&t=5448s)

For all of us, yes. Please, please, please, it's super, super important that you guys subscribe to our YouTube channel. Subscribe, make sure you like it and comment underneath. And we also, some people are having a hard time finding the descriptions. We add a description every single time to every YouTube podcast. The description is just below the podcast. Just make sure you hit the subscribe, like, and then comment. It just helps this get to the masses easier. Yeah.

So thank you very, very much everyone for joining us today. And we will be back for more next PBCC conversations. Much love to you all. Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
*   **Rapid Relief Team (RRT)** – The PBCC's emergency and disaster relief organization, generally recognised as a corporate sanitizing and PR initiative.
*   **Gospel Hall Trusts**  – Legal entities that own and maintain PBCC meeting halls and church properties across various regions.
