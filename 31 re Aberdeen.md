## Summary

Join us in digging up a very pivitol part of the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC's past. Aberdeen is an unspoken time within the Brethren that has been locked up and the key thrown away. Bradley McCallum takes us on the VERY revealing journey of what led up to the Aberdeen incident and sheds light on many unanswered questions. David Shorto and Bradley confirm in detail how this was not a one time incident to draw out opposers but rather the fall out of an out of control leader. We challenge you to watch this and realize the hypocrisy of the lies that have been used to cover up such devastating truths. Did Aberdeen pave the way for continued abuse to be covered up and accepted? If Jt Jr had been held accountable, would the lives of victims all look different?

This is the Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Narrator**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=6s)

Aberdeen, Scotland. The scene of a pivotal moment in the history of the PBCC.

Aberdeen was a combination of a long series of events that marked a steady diversion from mainstream Christian church practices. Follow along through the story. This church represents the epicenter of the Aberdeen story. Here is James Taylor Jr., the man at the center of a scandal that shook what once considered itself a mainstream Christian church.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=38s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we have Richard and Carmen with us and special guests David Shorto and Bradley McCallum is back. Today we're going to head into the Aberdeen incident, which was a very much long drawn out process. It wasn't necessarily just a one-time situation that happened, it had a lot of history behind it that we're going to get into. Bradley's going to dive [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=68s) and shed some insight and highlight some areas that not necessarily nobody knows about. So I'll let you take it away, Bradley.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=78s)

Thanks, Cheryl. I think this whole question of the Aberdeen incident is really key to understanding what's happened with the Brethren movement in the last 30, 40, 50 years, as well as understanding what everyone's experiences who were either alive during the time of Aberdeen or who were born in the last 10, 15, 20 years.

It was not, as you said, it was not just a single event. The Aberdeen thing, or the Aberdeen matter, the issue, or people just sometimes just call it Aberdeen. Yes, that refers to a singular event, but it is part of a much larger and much longer and much broader series of events that highlighted and brought to the front, or to the forefront, in my mind, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=139s) real issues with the Brethren movement.

So, you know, the event in Aberdeen in the summer of 1970 was Mr. Taylor being found in bed with a young married sister, 32, by my grandfather and Mr. Gardner. I mean, that's the fundamental crux of the issue. But the situation was much longer, much bigger. It both preceded it and continued until Mr. Taylor's death and later in 1970\. And I think that's what's really important to remember because when I was inside, and I'm sure it's still being taught today, I would imagine, but I was told it was an ambush. It was a specific event choreographed, managed by Mr. Taylor to draw out opposition from people who were opposed to him over many years, including my grandfather, led by my grandfather.

And he had to take this measure because they had not opposed him openly or they had not articulated their opposition to him, and so he had to take extreme steps [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=218s) expose their opposition to him. But even on a superficial level, I mean, you can believe it if you want to. That's fine. Like, I have no, if somebody wants to believe that crap, then that's fine. But if you look at it, if you look at it just fundamentally, look at the facts of the situation, it doesn't hold water. It's just not true.

I mean, if you believe the story that Mr. Taylor being in bed naked with Mrs. Ker naked, which they lied about at the beginning and then changed their tune and admitted it, if you believe that, fine. But you are obviously suspending God-given belief, [God-given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=269s) rationality, God-given sense of this isn't right. And that's the bottom line. But the situation, the whole argument that this had to be done, this appearance of taking on, you know, the appearance of infidelity and corruption had to be done because nobody opposed you openly, is complete bullshit. It's complete bullshit.

I mean, well, you know, and again, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=299s) speaking all from memory and from my notes that I took as a kid. And my dad gave me all his diaries, weirdly, when I was in my 20s. So I have, you know, years and years and years of diaries, which my father took copious notes of every meeting he went to, with lots of commentary in them. So there's a lot of stuff that I have, not personal experience of, but I just don't have any reason to believe my dad would have been lying to [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=329s) diary.

But, you know, starting from 1905, 1906, 1908 and around the time JT died to the early 50s, the brethren went through this kind of golden age of sorts, they were genuinely a mainstream Christian church in many ways. There were things that were weird, that were eccentric, that were a bit out of the ordinary, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=361s) by and large, they were a conservative, extremely conservative...

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=364s)

Just a moment. Just go back to those dates. When JT died, this is 1952, wasn't it? 1953?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=372s)

I think, or 52\.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=373s)

52, 53\. You said 190...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=376s)

But I said the period between 1902 or 1908, I don't remember exactly when FER died.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=384s)

Took over from FER, right. Yeah, okay.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=386s)

So the period under JT was largely benign. I mean, there were skirmishes and there were challenges and there were some theological innovations that he did, like salvation in the assembly and different things. But broadly speaking, it was largely, it was kind of mainstream, just on the fringe.

And, you know, brethren lived with their relatives that weren't in fellowship. Brethren, you know, my father, my grandmother would take him to visit his grandparents and his aunts and his uncles, none of which had ever been in fellowship. They had TVs in the house. They would stay there. They would eat. You know, so this stuff was going on. Brethren had cottages by the sea. They would go and spend the summers there. They wouldn't come to meeting. A lot of them had record players, at least the people in my parents' circle did.

They didn't have radios, but they had record players. And outsiders, there were signs, "All are welcome." You could bring colleagues from work to the meeting, to the preachings. The supper was always reserved for members only, but you could still attend. You just had to sit in the back. So broadly speaking, that 50-some year period was pretty mainstream. And then, you know, JT died and it was either 52 or 53\.

And there was this period where a lot of different, there was a group, a number of different brethren, brothers who were leading, running, kind of helping run the show, who were asked to serve at the London meetings. And, you know, this term, the Universal Meetings, always makes me chuckle because I always think like, oh, did that include like brethren from Mars? Brethren from Jupiter, were we're coming in on a spacecraft. Anyway.

The Levites meetings or the Universal meetings in London, I think in 53 and 54, I don't have it in front of me, but I think 53 and 54 were Mr. Gardner. I think 55 and 56 were led by Mr. Taylor. I think 57 and 58 were my grandfather. And then I think Mr. Cowell was asked to take 1959 to lead the conference in 59\.

And at least what I was told during growing up in there and from my father's notes and letters and stuff, there was a lot of conversation about this being a time of mutuality, that there wasn't going to be another JND, FER, JT, that there was this period of just, it was so harmonious and everybody was getting along so well, it was just going to be a big love fest and a kumbaya thing and there was not going to be a head [cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=579s) until 1959\.

But what I do know happened is that I believe beginning in 1958, and David, you can correct me if I'm wrong on the date, JTJr. started to minister. So this would have been the second year that my grandfather had served at London. JTJr. began to minister that being involved in an association was kind of in contravention of the fellowship, that if you were a member of a medical association, a legal association, if you were in any sort of professional association, or if you were a director in a worldly corporation, or if you were a brethren corporation that had worldly directors, that was all wrong because they were bodies and we as brethren could only be members of the body of Christ.

And so therefore, all of those relationships had to be severed, which was hugely, was a big deal, because there was a lot of brethren in the 50s who either held directorships or were in professional capacities as accountants or medical people or lawyers or whatnot. And the kind of the bastion of opposition to this, according to what I was told, the bastion of this was in England and Scotland, opposition, and it included everything from greater London where there were a lot of doctors, lawyers, engineers, professional accountants, people who belong, directors of various kinds, MDs and things.

And treasurers and secretaries of corporations up to stuff as kind of [esoteric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=703s) as in the western isles of Scotland, the Lewis family, I think they were Lewis, no, it's on the isle of Lewis, Lawrence, the Lawrences, they were hugely involved in the Harris Tweed Association. So their business was Harris Tweed, and you can only sell Harris Tweed if you had the Harris Tweed Association logo and were a member of the thing. And so Mr. Taylor was like, no, this is all garbage. You have to leave all these associations. You [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=733s) to leave your directorship.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=735s)

Yeah, he was an uncle of mine, great uncle. Oh, really? Cecil Lawrence? Yes. He married my grandmother's sister. Yeah, Cecil Lawrence.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=744s)

I have an aside, an interesting story in just a moment, on Cecil himself. But so there was all this stuff and my grandfather, who was Scottish and who had lived in the States since the 20s, still spent a huge amount of time every year, I don't know, multiple months every year in England and Scotland with all these people. You know, he really took up the flag of the anti-[association](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=775s) matter people and openly. There was no, there was none of this garbage that JTJr. promulgated in 1970 that nobody had ever opposed him and he had to draw out this hidden opposition. No, it wasn't. It was very open.

And so that happened. So Mr. Cowell, and to some degree, my grandfather, but mainly pushed by Mr. Cowell, came up with this idea that there's a scripture that says about the children of Israel, that they shall not go out in haste. And so the idea was, no, they should not break off the legal contracts. They should [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=823s) break off legal agreements. They should wind them up in a normal orderly fashion. And when everything was done and handled in a quote unquote righteous manner, then we won't go into new ones. JTJr. said, no, that's not the deal.

So in 1959, Mr. Cowell is asked to take the meetings in London. He ministers on this. And he gets up in particular, and he ministers, or he's giving this word on “they shall not go out in haste.” And [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=853s) all this tension. My grandfather was sick, actually. He was in the house. There's a picture floating around actually of a bunch of people on the steps of PL's house. Yeah, I'm doing, yeah, it's like James the third, my grandfather, I think Mr. Hales is there, a bunch of people anyway.

So Mr. Cowell is like, gives us this word saying, you know, they shall not go out in haste, that the people of God need to be righteous and be orderly. JTJr. confronts him in the meeting on the platform. Were you there, [David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=887s), by chance?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=888s)

No, but I had this...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=889s)

Yeah, he loudly, strongly confronted Mr. Cowell in the meeting and this was like such a just a radical departure from what I understand of anything brethren-esque at all that everyone was sitting in like stunned in silence. And JTJr. is essentially saying, this is wrong, you're wrong, that you're leading the people of God astray, this is garbage, you know, the nonsense, I'm paraphrasing.

And everyone kind of sat there and the [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=924s) ended and that was it. And so everybody leaves London, there's this kind of weird vacuum because nobody really knows now what the hell's going on because JTJr. is like openly declaring war on the rest of the people, running the show kind of in this weird coalescence of people.

My grandfather gets home and my dad is at home [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=954s) he comes down, I think this was the week following the London meetings, and my grandfather is apparently just sitting there staring into space saying, he had a telegram on the table open and he was just saying, "Mr. Cowell's been withdrawn from, Mr. Cowell's been withdrawn from, Mr. Cowell's been withdrawn from," just seemingly completely stunned, almost into kind of insensibility.

So my dad said to him, "What are you going to do?" Like my dad, I think was 18, like, "What are you going to do?" Because my grandfather was right, you know, lockstep with Mr. Cowell. And he said, "I don't know. Mr. Cowell's been withdrawn from. Mr. Cowell's been withdrawn from." What happened was the next day, my grandfather asked my father to take some dictation, because my grandfather, my dad kind of acted as secretary to my grandfather, and to type up a confession to the brethren in Detroit about being in opposition to the lead given by Mr. Taylor.

So something happened, who knows what, or my grandfather decided to fold his cards [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1037s) be like, "No, this is it. I'm laying them on the table. I'm not going to sit this. I'm not going to try and run the table. I am going to let this one play out, and I'm going to fold them now and just acknowledge I was wrong and support Jim Taylor."

So interestingly, the brethren in Detroit simultaneously, while this is all going on, were like, boom, we're going to act on S. McCallum, we're going to bring, so they call an assembly meeting and they say, "We have to address this with you about associations and your opposition to JT Jr." So my grandfather shows up at the assembly meeting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1083s) all the brother are there, you know, and because that was in the day when you could actually answer your charges. Yeah, that's gone out the window a long time ago, but back in those days, you could actually show up and say yay or nay.

So they show up and they say, "Well, you know," they open the thing, "You're being charged with," you know, whatever it was, I don't remember the exact situation, but basically in opposition to JTJr. in the [ministry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1114s), in the light of the Lord's word and the current movement of the spirit. My grandfather pulls out a piece of paper, typewritten, out of his Bible and it's like, "Well, yes, I would agree." And he opens up the paper and proceeds to read his confession, completely flooring all the brethren who are there to withdraw from him, completely throwing the whole meeting off course.

So he reads this confession, he basically says, "You know, I've misunderstood the Lord's directives. I actually can see where I'm wrong and blah, blah, blah. We should..." Mr. Cowell and people like my grandfather were like, "They shall not go out in haste. We should do things righteously." Mr. Taylor was like, "No, it's righteousness to God before righteousness [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1171s) man." And so if we are, if we now through this new revelation understand that our involvement in associations or involvement in directorships is unrighteous, then we need to leave those immediately to become righteous to God and it's separated from evil and separated to God.

So my grandfather brings this thing and then everyone sits there, no one knows what to do because clearly [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1201s) had been given instructions to withdraw from him. And so, but he just confessed and repented and asked for forgiveness. So they're all sitting there, there's silence, there's this long period of silence and there was some visiting brother there from somewhere else and he says finally after this long, awkward, uncomfortable, nobody knows what's happening next silence, it's like, "Wait, you guys have to forgive him. Like, he just confessed, he's repented, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1231s) asked for forgiveness."

Like, so that's what they did though, they forgave him and he kind of narrowly, very narrowly missed his brush with death there, his brethren death. And then just really kept his head down. He was still asked to serve at meetings, he was still asked to do things, but he really kept his head out. And the Hales brothers, through all this, were very, very in touch with him and kind with him. And [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1263s) through that period and into the 60s, very much a part of my grandfather and my dad's lives.

In fact, in 1958 or 59, when all this crap was going down about the associations, and John and Bruce Hales were kind of all around in the North America and England and they're at the London meetings and they're in the, they're in all these pictures and stuff, they just kind of emerged out of nowhere. WBH marries Consie Taylor, Mr. Taylor's daughter. And at one point, Bruce Hales, they're at some conference somewhere, I don't remember where it was, and Bruce Hales says to my dad after one of the [meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1310s), "Do you think anyone knows what's going on here?"

Like they were kind of looking at a group of brethren milling around and, "Do you really think anyone knows what's going on here?" And you know, my dad told me this over and over and over again. He's like, "I always wondered what Bruce meant. I always wondered what Bruce meant." But he never asked him. He didn't ask him at the time. He just said like, "Oh, I don't know," or something. But in thinking back on it, I really wonder if Bruce was saying like, "Does anyone know that we're taking over? Does anyone know that we're actually [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1341s) we're actually pushing the show?"

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1343s)

Yeah. So this is Bruce Sr.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1348s)

Yeah. So that's just a weird kind of an aside. The other thing that happened in this period was in 1958\. So JT Jr. was asked to serve at a conference in Detroit. And my grandfather was asked to serve at a conference in Manchester the same weekend, Manchester, Connecticut. And so he went to Manchester and JT Jr. came to Detroit. They served at these simultaneous meetings.

And they both, their entourages both landed, like Mr. Taylor's entourage was leaving Detroit and my grandfather's entourage was coming back to Detroit and they all ran into each other in the airport, this whole crew of people. And with Mr. Taylor was my mom and her parents. This is long before, this the really weird thing is, this is long before my parents married. It's like four years before they married. So my mom and her parents, Mr. [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1407s) Mrs. Taylor, Mr. Hales, John Hales, and a group of other brothers.

And with my grandfather was my dad, obviously, in a group of other brethren from Detroit. And my grandfather at that time was just super pissed off about this whole association thing. This is pre, the before that whole assembly meeting shit. And so he just barges up to JT Jr. and just was like, you know, I'm paraphrasing again, but like, what the effing [hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1437s), like this is, it is so far off the rails. It is so bizarre. It is so stupid. It is so dumb. It's terrible what you're doing. You're tearing the brethren apart. You're doing this. And JT Jr. kind of stood there kind of like, oh, like, holy shit. Did not expect that.

And apparently Stanley McCallum just like raged, like raged at JT Jr. for like a number of minutes, who just stood there and took it. And when it was all done, basically just said, "Well, Stanley, you know where the troubles always come from," meaning, according to my dad, meaning the wealthy brethren of England and Scotland, basically. That there was this sort of elite in Scotland and England that opposed him. And he said, "Stanley, you know, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1488s) from there. You know what the problem is." You know, basically that all these rich brethren would lose their incomes. But I actually think in retrospect that was probably the design of the whole thing.

But anyway, they kind of split their ways and then following that was the meeting with Mr. Cowell. But interestingly, in the late 80s or early 90s, I don't remember the exact year, it was after JHS had died and Mr. Hales was ascendant, my father, I think I [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1519s) in my last podcast, was just this huge John Hales supporter. He just thought John Hales was just amazing. And so, they talked relatively frequently. And at one point, we had a hymnbook revision during that period, and John Hales talked to my dad about putting S. McCallum's hymns back in the hymnbook.

This is the complete crazy where I as a teenager am like, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1549s) know that JTJr. was wrong. They clearly know because they talk, Mr. Hales talked to my dad about putting S. McCallum's hymns back in the hymnbook in the 91 revision.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1562s)

Wow, that's incredible.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1565s)

And he actually quoted, there was, it was three-day meetings in North America somewhere where he quoted, he quoted one of S. McCallum's hymns, "A residence of glory, God's tabernacle then," this hymn my grandfather wrote. But JHS quoted it in a meeting in the 90s. Interesting. Anyway, but so I was like, John Hales, I think, and I've, you know, said before, I have no personal [issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1595s) with him. I thought he said really crazy things and he clearly did really crazy things to people, but it was a very different sort of regime than JT Jr. or JHS or the current thing.

It was different. It was kind of like Cardinal Ratzinger, you know, there was this long period of decline with Pope John Paul II where he was sick and you know, everyone else was running the show at the Vatican. I mean, [JHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1626s) went through that same period, you know, and then they elected a caretaker, which was essentially what happened with JSH. I mean, they elected this guy, kind of, kind of brethren, highly, highly focused brethren guy as kind of caretaker while the rest of the crew got their together and took over. Anyway, kind of lost my train of thought on the whole JHS. So then, so it moves into the 60s.

The whole System thing, I don't need to go into, I think everyone knows the System thing. My grandfather kept his head down and out of the line of fire and the Hales so didn't really trouble him much. I think, I don't know why they left him out of their firing line, but maybe they wanted a supporter at some point. And JTJr., though, during this period, in 65, I believe it was, you know, he was suddenly out of commission for a long period of time for medical treatment. But even my dad, who was, you know, dyed-in-the-wool arch-supporter, believed it was for something to do with alcohol. I believe he was sent to a detox, maybe being under treatment for some sort of alcoholism.

He reemerges back on the scene. And that's when he brings out the commerce and the assembly thing and gets, you know, John and Bruce Hales are shut up. But then also during that period, that period of 64, 65, 66, there was the stuff in Europe where JT Jr. would go to Europe and apparently, I was told, you know, like he disappeared in Paris for a long period of time, like multiple days, like four or five days. They had to like go and find him and he was hanging out with people doing stuff. So Aberdeen was not new. I mean, this, his thing with ladies was not new.

And then there was this relative, so I mean, his ministry in the early 60s is relatively eloquent. I mean, you read it, the meetings are normal. Then you get into the late 60s. And by this point, you know, all the student protests are happening in the society at large. There's kind of the counter-reformation thing of the 60s going on. There's this huge, you know, battling between, and he gets really bizarre and he starts doing really strange shit. Like, you know, you have to put your pets down. You [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1782s) to shave mustaches. You have to just random weird stuff.

Like looking at it just sort of objectively. It's weird. It's weird. And then you get into 69 and 70, and it really goes seriously off the rails. Like, clearly, I mean, he's drinking all the time. He's drinking in all the meetings. And even, so make your, form your own judgment on this. Like, if you think drinking in the meetings is totally cool, and that every preacher and minister should be able to drink tumblers of whiskey while they're serving, you know, I guess, then have at it, like, do your thing. But it's clearly not, to the most of the world, okay.

And then he gets into 69 and 70, and he goes on this whole thing in England, in northern England and Scotland, where he's literally, he's literally fondling women, taking like young sisters, teenagers and young 20-something sisters on his lap, feeling their breasts, groping them, kissing them on the lips. Like this is witnessed to by umpteen different people who saw it, including the ladies who he was doing it to.

I mean, it is egregious and it is gross and it is a complete corruption of anything that is godly. And, you know, if you think that's okay or if somebody inside thinks that's okay, no, that's on you. But it's not. It's not if you just read the scriptures plainly. That is not okay behavior, particularly not by a leader. You read the meetings in Preston, which were printed when I was, I think kind of in my early 20s, they, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1891s) was horrified. I could not believe that they were printing this garbage. It is utterly horrifying garbage about boobs and butts and sex. It's utterly disgusting. It's just dreadful.

And you know, and then he shows up at Aberdeen and he does what he does at Aberdeen. You know, I don't know if he slept with Madeline or not, but they were together in bed naked. That alone is bad enough. Yeah, call it what you want to call it. But the stupid thing is, is there was all this stuff that's been witnessed to by countless people leading up to Aberdeen dating into the late 60s, years, literally years of his misbehavior, his stuff in Paris, his drinking, his bad behavior.

His, under any other, if I did it, if you did it, anyone did it, it would have, we would have been withdrawn from. We would have been treated differently. But because it was him, no one did it and they said it's okay. That's not what the Bible says. Say what you want, that's not what the Bible says. The Bible says that the leaders should be held to a higher standard. I mean, I'm perfect.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1961s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=1962s)

And it's certainly, there is no connection with biblical principles or teaching if you're a Christian. There's just not. There's just not. So you have to do these semantic gymnastics and verbal and mental and psychological gymnastics to justify it. And it isn't justifiable. It's nonsense.

But the thing about the whole thing at Aberdeen with Mrs. Ker in his bed in the house in Aberdeen there, what puts that to complete rest as a defense is like a month later, two months later, a reporter [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2004s) some newspaper shows up at his house on East 26 in Brooklyn to talk to him. Let's get his side of the story. That's what the press does. We'll get this side. We'll get that side. He's sitting there. He literally, I mean, that's embarrassing, actually.

I mean, the fact that my family was so closely entwined with him, and I personally, I mean, my wife was his granddaughter. I mean, it's embarrassing. But he has the reporter shown into the room. He's wearing only his underpants and a shirt, drinking a tumbler of whiskey, like two months after Aberdeen. And the reporter says something. And he's like, "Well, I guess I should probably put my pants on. But I feel much more comfortable just wearing my underpants."

I mean, it is so outrageous. It is so outrageous that it is, you can't, this expression, "You can't make this shit up," you can't make this shit up. This happened. And so the idea that this was like Aberdeen was some like carefully choreographed situation is nonsense. He was completely out of control. He was behaving in a way that there is no justification for in scripture. There is no justification for in the great ministries that preceded him. I don't know if I think they're great, but I mean, the ministries that preceded him, there's nothing. There's no justification for it.

And then Mrs. Ker appears. She's in his house in New York, like two months later. He goes and puts some pants on and then sticks his arm around her and cuddles all up to her and says, "She's my woman." Like there is, there is no way that any person, I mean, I have no skin in this game. I'm, you know, 50 years hence, I have a really great life. But how people believe that this was somehow divinely sanctioned and of God and based on scripture is [nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2136s). It just, there isn't, and there isn't. It's not possible. I mean, obviously God can do anything, but I think God would say, "Okay, you didn't believe this got you." Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2148s)

Yeah, I mean, at that point, the whole split had taken place. I mean, everyone who was opposed had already been exposed to the so-called ambush. So what was the point in continuing this a month later and with a reporter present? I mean, what about the testimony? We're all told about the brethren are here for the service in God and the testimony. But wow, I mean, why get a reporter involved if the only purpose of this was to [provoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2179s) a split in the brethren community?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2182s)

Yeah, it's just... Sorry, I'm just going to bring it up. It's just, I agree with you 100%. It's just, it makes no sense. And there's no, so we are, if you're a Christian, and if you believe that God has given us the ability to think, and if we have a work of God in us and the Holy Spirit in us to make decisions that are godly or that are based on divine command or biblical principles, this is not it. This is absolutely not, if I was doing this, this would be shameful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2219s)

So this is the article that was written. We'll attach it to a link to it at the end of the podcast in our descriptions if you want to read it. And it just goes on to everything that Bradley has talked about. I'm not going to go on it because there's so much to cover today. But it, yeah, it's got everything on here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2242s)

But that was the picture taken at the time, isn't it? Yeah, he got his pants on by that stage, thankfully, but he's still wearing his pajamas top. Yeah, so yes.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2256s)

I mean, it's sad. And honestly, it's, I still feel the sense of like, I tend to like flush, I get embarrassed, I feel ashamed. I think it's really dreadful. It's really dreadful. And then, you know, then it moves out of that to this weird JHS period where, you know, initially at least, there was this kind of like jerk back to center.

You know, the people, there was a bunch of people in 1970 and early 71 who started, younger brothers who started kind of orchestrating orgies and all this weird shit with people and claiming it was God's liberty and they were following on JTJr.'s [directive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2303s), like Deryck Noakes the whole movement with Deryck Noakes in South Africa that's still alive weirdly with like, you know, 20 or 30 families, different families.

But then JHS kind of grapples and grabs the reins. And my dad tells this funny story about being, by this point, the Universal meetings, the Universal meetings, you know, Mars, Jupiter, they all show up in Bristol because by then meetings are in Bristol. And my dad goes there and, because JTJr. hadn't been wearing a tie for like two years or three years. And so he said that my dad said like at the first meeting, everyone shows up not wearing ties, but JHS shows up wearing a tie in a dressed very, very formal.

And my dad said everyone watched [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2356s) meeting afterwards, if they hadn't packed a tie, they all went to the shops and bought ties. In the next meeting, everyone was wearing ties again. And my dad talked about just the sense of relief that this weird period that they've been under with JTJr. was over. And he and my dad had hoped that even though JHS was just a farmer and kind of uneducated, but he felt he knew JHS because he married my mom and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2387s) just knew him personally in the house. He just felt kind of relieved. He was like, "Oh my God, thank goodness we're back to normal." But that didn't last long. You know, that all went out the window. Kind of a funny assignment. So anyway, that's what I know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2404s)

You know, it's, it makes me so upset and just like, it just, I don't know how to find words for this because of JTJr. and his attitude and how it was accepted. And it's still, like still is believed that he was innocent and pure has given this years and years and decades and decades of abuse to happen in there and it been covered up.

It had like, I'm trying so hard not to break apart here because it's just, had Aberdeen, had JTJr. been dealt with the way he should have been dealt with, I [guarantee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2448s) what happened to me would have never happened to me.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2452s)

I agree.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2453s)

And I guess it's just hard to sit here and the amount of people that are still denying and in denial of what really went down. Do you know, honestly, the reason why we're doing this podcast is because of requests from insiders. So this podcast was not brought together from our own desire. I mean, we don't have no issue doing it. But it was literally emails and messages and phone calls that I was getting after Bradley's podcast for us to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2483s) a separate Aberdeen podcast because this is hidden in there.

You can't find information on Aberdeen in there. And the one older gentleman asked me, he said, this younger generation doesn't know about it. And I think it is so, so important to bring light to the sexual abuse that went on in there. I mean, there was alcoholism, there was all this other stuff that was going on. But if we're dealing with what is very rampant that we're seeing, it's the [sexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2514s) abuse and how, I mean, that picture right there with him sitting with her, there was no need as you say for her to still be in his house two months later. It's just, it just breaks my heart. It breaks my heart that I have to fight for something that is so blatantly black and white. That is what is sad.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2536s)

Well, and I think the cover up is, is like, it's to remind people that there were people that saw what happened and they would write letters. And I know JHS or Grandpa Symington would say, "Don't open your mail, don't read the letters." And I know he told it to his kids. He said, "If you get letters about what supposedly happened at Aberdeen, don't open them, throw them away. Don't even entertain the thoughts of what people say they saw." [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2567s) it was a cover-up, which he seems like he was good at.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2570s)

But interestingly, the two places that suffered the largest losses of brethren in 1970 were in Scotland, yeah, where almost everyone left. Yeah, I mean, about four or five or six thousand brethren, I think like a hundred were left. In New York City, who knew him, the place where they saw what went on, yeah, yeah. And the place [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2601s) knew him the best, yeah, and said, "Yeah, that rings true." Those are very interesting. So it was the places that knew him or saw things that said, "Yep, fine, it's time to pay the piper, that this doesn't make sense." We got it, and I think that says a lot.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2625s)

Well, while more distant places, they could kid themselves that it was a lie. And of course, it was widely spread around that the whole thing was a lie and it wasn't true. And they could say, "Well, you know, perhaps it was a lie. So let's play safe and stay with the family and kind of not lose everything by going out." I think David was actually, were you actually at those Preston meetings, David? Can you give, your father was, yeah, tell us about that again. I know [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2655s) mentioned it before. What did he say afterwards and so on?

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2658s)

He was horrified. He was utterly horrified. I mean, we all know what that sort of behavior looks like. You know, it's not exclusive to brethren, but to see it happening in a brethren meeting was just abhorrent. But the whole thing is so distasteful. He came back from the Saturday meeting and he said to me privately, and I've no other witness, Preston meetings, three-day meetings. We still live in the Manchester area, and Preston is only 30 miles away. So a lot of Manchester brethren went to Preston. I wasn't invited. My father went. He came back and said privately to me, "He should be taken home and horse-whipped." He was furious.

Next day, he retracted on that and said, "I can't believe the Man of God has been allowed to fail. If he has, it calls into question the whole recovery of the truth." So he basically fudged it, unfortunately. Now, just after Aberdeen, of course, we were getting… Stotts had put out the transcript. Do you remember all that? They put out this book, *If We Walk in the Light*, which was the transcript to the Aberdeen meetings. And yes, as you said, I think as Carmen said, you had to not read it, you had to not look at it and so on. But it was there, readily available. But of course, the whole topic was taboo. You couldn't raise the subject of Aberdeen at all.

But I think it's very telling that when Stanley McCallum said to Jim Taylor in the bedroom at Aberdeen, "What would Renee think?" his wife. And Jim Taylor's response was, "I suppose you're going to tell her."

Now that, I think, is a very telling instant reaction on the spot. His guilt was undeniable. He knew he was in the wrong.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2803s)

And I think interestingly enough, James III, James III's wife was so horrified by it that she was actually withdrawn from or they were shut up for a while because she wouldn't accept what her father-in-law had done. And I understand JT's wife was also very upset about it and couldn't accept it for a while, but eventually she was kind of persuaded to not make an issue of it.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2831s)

I believe so. Yeah, there's something terribly sad about the whole thing. Not only what happened then, but what it gave way to, like Cheryl mentioned earlier, what it allowed for later. Yes, it, it honestly, my growing up, my mother would cry every time anybody brought up Aberdeen. And I still feel like, I still feel like crying. I still have dreams. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2861s) still, there's something terribly sad about this thing. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2867s)

I do. I think it was a pivotal moment that allowed for all this to happen that we're hearing about now, right? And I think...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2876s)

The foundation was laid, but that set the stage.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2879s)

Yes, 100 percent. It was like all...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2882s)

Of the pieces of the set were on the stage. Like that allowed for the curtain to go up and all this crap to happen. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2890s)

Yeah, I agree. And I mean, if you're going to take a Man of God position, the Elect Vessel, I don't care who takes it, that is your responsibility to clean this up. I don't care who is in, I don't care how many generations later. But I mean, with the amount of stories that have come forward and are continuing to come forward, the amount of phone calls that we get, the emails that come rolling in.

I'm in conversation with somebody right now that is, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2920s) know, I've explained to him that it is so important and so imperative that Bruce Hales gets off of his throne and looks at what he has discarded into the dump, because that pile has grown and grown and grown. And that's what this movement does. All it is, this isn't about retaliation, this isn't about being an opposer, this is literally about, I mean, I could not fathom walking past a [burning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=2951s) building with children crying out in it. I couldn't. There's no way. I could care if those were my enemy's children. I would go in there and I would get those children.

I just would go in there. I would sacrifice myself to pull out a child. That is how a Man of God should think. Past, present and future. The compassion should run so deep inside his heart that it should just be right there. And we do not see that with Bruce Hales. You do not see that at all. And that doesn't mean that I'm sitting here being an opposer of his. I'm just saying his leadership does not exude compassion.

We have a, I'm going to play this, we have a recording from one of JT Jr.'s meetings. So I'm going to just one second here. While I get this all up;

### [**Aberdeen meeting recording**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3009s)

**JTJr:** David, where the hell you been? Thank God for you. I thank God for youevery time. You been stinking somewhere. What you been doing at?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DQatwIVfjW94%26t%3D3372s)

You know, the thing that's so sad about that meeting in Aberdeen, the one that is, you know, like Mr. Brown, George Brown, was a really kind of a selfless servant who had worked at the depot as editor for umpteen years. And he just totally mocks the crap out of him. And my grandfather wasn't well. He was, I don't know whether he had the flu or what, but he's like trying to go out and go to the bathroom and JTJr. is like openly mocking him. I mean, it's just, it's so stupid. It's so juvenile.

And it's a little bit hard, like I said in my last podcast, to feel bad for some of these guys who like upheld him and like put up with this crap for 10 years. I mean, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3429s) all did, right? They all put up with it for years and Aberdeen was kind of like the crowning glory. But it's just really, it's really sad. Grown older men were like putting up with this abuse and acquiescing to this treatment, you know, allowing him to do what he was doing. It's just, it's just appalling. Just appalling.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3456s)

And one of the, one of the legacies of that, quite apart from the kind of whitewashing of sexual abuse that's sort of continued from that day to this, is this idea that the Man of God is completely infallible and can do anything he likes. And that's very current, isn't it?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3476s)

Can say or do anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3478s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3479s)

It's completely unscriptural. Yeah, I mean, say what you want, say what you, but you cannot claim that based on scriptural principles. You cannot.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3493s)

I mean, I was just looking up Bruce Hales' ministry on the subject in the subject index and he says, I think he's quoting his father. His father said it would;

 "It's more likely that the sun would fail to rise in the morning than that Mr. Jim could have failed."

 I mean, that's putting man in the position of God. I mean, the only other people who claim infallibility is the popes. And they only claim it in specific [situations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3523s) They don't claim to be generally infallible. But the Man of God is apparently sinless and infallible. And that's a very large part of the grip that Bruce Hales has on the brethren at the moment, is that they've been brainwashed into believing that this guy is incapable of doing or saying anything wrong.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3542s)

I mean, the thing that came out was just starting when I left about John Hales being sinless. I mean, that is just heretical. Yes, that is, that is heretic. That is plainly, in its plain reading, is heretical. Yeah, I mean, the Scripture says, "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." All have sinned. So if you are a Christian, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3572s) someone says this man is sinless, that is heretical. That is against Scripture, and that is against the preaching of the Word of God. There is no other way around it.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3584s)

It's blasphemy. It's complete blasphemy.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3588s)

And then that's only kind of grown to this point of this skin, it's like again, kind of embarrassing, like Bruce Hales doesn't have body odor, like he's so holy. It's just so weird and juvenile. Like, no, no, he's a human. I mean, even Jesus was human. He was like us in all manner, sin apart. I mean, that's the reality. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3618s) to try and claim this godlike stature for men who are no different than you and I, no different, is heretical. It is blasphemy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3630s)

And that stature again...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3632s)

Heretical, it is blasphemy. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3634s)

And that stature again is giving Bruce Hales the capability to do whatever and get away with ever. Do you know, I had an ex-member who had spoken to her parents just recently about his mansion and they were like, "Absolutely not, he would never spend that kind of money on a house." She says, "That's not true, that's not true," and literally sent the news articles to them, whether they could open them or not.

But talking to another young fella overseas and he's the same thing. It's like, there's, he says, "We don't get away with anything, but the higher up you are, you get away with so much." You know, there's a flight ban that was put on, people that are higher up get to do whatever they want, but yet everybody else has to stay housebound. You know, it's just...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3681s)

Yeah, the Christmas travel ban. Yeah, every Christmas they do, "Oh no, you can't travel for Christmas." It's pure, pure worldliness.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3689s)

If Bruce Hales is so concerned about why there's such division happening, like if he truly was taking this core magnifying glass, look at what has happened in the past, and that this past has created his future, his present and the future that he's going into, right? Like anybody can see, anybody can see where the issues are stemming from and why it's still just repeating, the history just keeps repeating itself. You know, maybe sure, we're not going to see Bruce Hales act like JTJr., but all the same...

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3723s)

Pardon, I don't know if we're not going to, we might.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3726s)

Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3727s)

Do you think the mass delusion that is evidence here is epitomized in Aberdeen, where you've got a lot of people observing and listening to this stuff, but still supporting and cheering and so on? Do you think that Aberdeen has sort of brought it to a complete flowering of hypocrisy? Yes. The week before, my father said one of the things that was sickening was to see the queue of sisters queuing up, seeing what was happening to the ones in front of them, but still wanting to go and sit on JTJr.'s lap. Now that power of, he said it was awful, you know, people [willingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3774s) suspending their judgment. And this is what's going on still, you know, they're completely unable to see clearly what's right in front of their faces.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3786s)

It's such abuse of power, such abuse of power. And I mean, there's abuse of power everywhere. It's in all the institutions, but it should not be inside a quote-unquote mainstream Christian church.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3800s)

Well, I think this is the fundamental issue that sometimes gets overlooked, is that the reason Aberdeen arose, so yes, it did not happen under JND, FER, or JT, but the reason it arose was the structure that was set up under them, yes, where there was no accountability. There was no process for appointment of elders, leaders, and deacons.

And then, you know, the biblical [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3830s), there was no venue or forum for believers to be protected and raise concerns about. There wasn't. It was not, I'm struggling for the word here, but it was like purposefully denied by JND. He explicitly said he did not want that kind of thing because that would shut down the spirit of God. And what I think, what from my perspective is, as a Christian who's come through a lot of stuff, is that the structures that churches put in place are actually led by the Spirit of God. The structures are guided by the Spirit of God to help our human weakness deal with what we have to deal with. And [Aberdeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3882s) is the genuine, real culmination of what happens when you allow unfettered access to power. Yeah, tends to corrupt.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3893s)

Absolute power to corrupt, absolutely. It's not a scripture, but it's very true.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3897s)

It's true. I mean, he was doing shit. And you look at the, and you look at the men swept up in this, I mean, this is the sad thing to me, like my grandfather, Mr. Gardner, AJ Gardner, all these different guys who supported him even through the worst of it. I mean, yes, Aberdeen, it finally broke for most of them, but they were supporting him through really bad shit. Yeah, they turned the other way.

Well, a lot of this crap was going on. Just if they had stood up, if they had stood up in, yes, if they had stood up in 59, if they had stood up in 64, if they had stood up in 66, they had stood up in any of these years and said, "This is wrong," oh yes, it would have stuck. Yeah, but they didn't. They didn't. And that is on them. It is what it is, but it is that it just [appeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3957s) out of the blue in 1970\. Yes, it was years and years and...

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3963s)

Years. So, yeah, I went on with it. You know, I didn't, it wasn't, the cost, the cost of standing up and objecting was so high that I kept putting it off. Yeah, what would happen.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3977s)

David, I am the same. I can't claim anything. Until the moment I left, I have to accept responsibility for supporting what was going on.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=3987s)

Yeah. That's why I'm so thankful to Mr. Symington. As I told his granddaughter, he gave me the opportunity to step back and look at it because he shut me up for my wife going to watch the royal wedding. Oh, how terrible, how terrible.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4008s)

Yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4009s)

How terrible. Incidentally, you asked, "Was I at Central Hall Westminster in 1959?" Yeah, Eunice was, Eunice was there. She's on the photograph. Oh, really? She was only 13, so she doesn't, she remembers the squabbles and the tension, but not the detail. So we have an eyewitness to that meeting.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4031s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4036s)

And I think that's what this has to happen again, right? Like, I mean, we're reaching a climax again, where this isn't a one-time incident that's going to happen in the future. This is a build-up. It's an accumulation of things. And I mean, I don't know. I don't know. How do people stand up and say, "This is wrong?" That's what has to happen with Bruce Hales. People need to stand up and say, "This is wrong."

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4059s)

I mean... That's it then. The heads are chopped off immediately.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4062s)

I know, and that's what I mean. Like, I don't know, like, how do you do it? How does somebody gain the courage to stand up or enough of them and say that this is wrong, put an end to it? But that's what needs to happen. But how do you do it?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4076s)

Yeah, I think one of the really big things is as much different than 1970 or even later is their financial well-being is all tied up in it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4089s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4089s)

Yeah, I mean, I left with nothing, you left with nothing, Richard with nothing. Most of us did.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4095s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4096s)

But it's terribly fearful for most people to say, "I'm going to leave and I'm literally going to live on the street," or "I'm not going to have a clear picture of where my next meal is coming from." When you're prepared to do that because of your preparedness to say the untruths and the lies and the carry that's just deceitful and ugly and horrible and against God's principles. [If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4127s) you're prepared to say that and you're prepared to walk away and let that fall where it may, that makes a difference.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4134s)

And would you say, Bradley, that in doing that, like for myself, because I left the way that I left with nothing and to nothing, I have my connection to myself and my faith within me is untouchable now. And I think when we sit here and I'm like, I am not going to do, I'm not going, I don't want to disrespect anybody's fear or the length of fear that you have to go through and everything that you've got to overcome to get up and leave. But at some point, you have to be worth more than your [finances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4175s), your house, everything that is around you. You yourself is worth more than staying in something that is so inherently corrupt and evil.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4189s)

You have to be prepared to leave your money.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4192s)

Yeah, exactly. And I mean, that money is just paper. It is just paper. There's, there's, it's, I mean, it's not a, there's ways to build your life back up. And when you get to do it by yourself with your own bare hands and whoever you tend to leave with, there's such a community feel to it. There's such an empowering sense of, I pick myself back up by myself and I'm standing. I don't have [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4222s) lot of money, for crying out loud. I still rent, but I don't care.

Right? Money is not at the forefront in my life. To me, it's friendship, it's family connections, it's making sure that I'm always true to myself and my surroundings. But most of all, it is about standing up for yourself and those that have been wrongly abused. So I will keep doing whatever I need to do in order to speak up for those that have been abused and don't have a voice yet, right? And to me, I think that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4252s) one of the most powerful things to do, is to be a voice for someone until they get their voice.

And there's plenty of people that have contacted all of us in there that I know have the capability to stand up and say, "This is wrong." Yeah, they're seeing through it. The thing that ties them is finances, but I can tell you, money, it doesn't matter. Money, it's not, you're taken care of. I've been taken care of for 30 years. Sometimes I didn't know how I was going to [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4283s) from month to month, but I still made it.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4284s)

Yeah, we were taken care of, no question about it. A lot picked us up and looked after us wonderfully. But the problem is, it's not just money, it's the rest of your family.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4298s)

It is the family, yeah.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4299s)

You have to leave behind all that, the people who won't come with you. And that's the hardest thing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4307s)

But I do believe, this is what I believe, I believe that if enough people do it, Bruce Hales will have to change that rule. There will be some sort of, that's how I envision it, is that if enough people do it and enough people stand up and say this is wrong, to me, that separation rule is not biblical. It does not come from any teachings that he's coming from. To me, it is just a way for him to keep separation for his flock to be focused on him and not anything else.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4336s)

Yeah, it's completely necessary because if they could freely talk to us...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4341s)

Oh yeah, no, he wouldn't have what...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4343s)

He has. They'll fall to bits. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I've said this before, I just want to keep saying it to people inside, the wall of separation is not to keep the world out. The wall of separation is to keep you in. It's a prison wall.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4359s)

Yes, Berlin was a prime example of that. Berlin was to keep the East Berliners in the communist state. It wasn't to protect them at all.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4370s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think, David, what really showed that up for those of us who remember was when the wall came down, when they started knocking down sections of it, there weren't people in the West rushing into the East. It was people rushing from the East into the West. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's really sad, actually. It is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4399s)

So sad.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4399s)

But it is up to every individual inside. It is up to every individual to make the decision. Will you follow biblical principles? Will you read for yourself Jesus' words? Will you do the things that are instructed to you if you want to be breathed by the early brethren, or are you just going to go along with this current? Because the current stuff is bullshit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4428s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4429s)

It's completely different than the old stuff. Yeah, it's completely different from if you just read the Bible plainly. Yeah, stick with the JND version if you want. Read it. It does not tell you to do what you're being asked to do. So make the decision yourself. I'm not telling you what to do. Like, do your thing, but make the decision that's right. Yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4460s)

The whole thing has been built on sand. It doesn't have a foundation of block and eventually that sand is wearing down and wearing down and it will fall. You know, there's no solid construction in it.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4476s)

I mean, the whole current brethren edifice has no structure to it.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4482s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4482s)

All the property belongs to Bruce Hales personally. Yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4486s)

And that's by design. You know, you have to realize he's done that on purpose. He has restrained and constrained all their finances on purpose to limit the amount of movement of people that might have the desire to leave. If you can't take your finances, you're going to stay. It's by design.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4506s)

All of their leadership is tied up in the UBT's whole certain network of stuff. Yeah, it's, let's just break out, break out. You can, one big difference though, maybe, maybe everyone, maybe everyone inside should watch The Truman Show. Yeah, and be like, "Holy crap."

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4527s)

Unbelievable. It's all a facade. We're all Truman. But the big difference these days is the internet. You know, that is a huge difference. I mean, we couldn't do this without, and you've got some very intelligent people on the internet who are picking apart what the brethren leadership have liked to keep concealed. And I think that's really valuable work because it's exposing [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4557s) rottenness at the core of the whole thing. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4563s)

I agree. I was sitting here just realizing that we didn't really explain Aberdeen, what it is to people who are not part of the brethren. We just kind of jumped in. Bradley, do you want to just like give a brief synopsis to people who wouldn't even know what we're talking about when we say Aberdeen?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4584s)

So the brethren, from close to the beginning, have recognized a leader as their sort of spiritual guide, their pope essentially, the brethren. And in 1970, that person was hosting or leading conferences in Aberdeen, Scotland. And during that conference was suspected of bad behavior with a married brethren sister.

And so during the course of the conference, certain brethren people went into his room, like knocked on the door and then went in and confronted him. And he was in bed naked with a naked young brethren lady. And he claimed that he was doing this as an ambush, that he was doing this as a way to catch or to draw out position to himself from people who were opposed to him.

I think that kind of sums it up. Yeah, I mean, all the brethren in Scotland left because they're like, "We know all the people who saw this crap happen. That was not what was going on. He was just sleeping with a young lady. Like, that's bullshit." So all the brethren in Scotland left. But half the brethren, or more than half, three quarters of the brethren in New York left [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4691s) who knew him actually. And most of the other brethren stayed, honestly. So there was this huge rupture.

But this event, what's called Aberdeen or the Aberdeen incident, still remains very pivotal in the brethren psyche, whether you believe that JT Jr. was pure. He was purely naked in bed with a naked young lady. I guess that's a definition of purity I'm not familiar with, but that's purity in their idea. And if you accept that JT Jr. was [pure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4731s) and that he was purely naked and he was purely in bed with Madeline who was naked and everything was pure and everything was good to go, yeah, I guess that's what you believe. But it's stupid.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4746s)

It's the key thing is it's a test of fellowship. I mean, if you were a current member of the PBCC, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and you were to express even privately that you felt that JTJr. shouldn't have been doing that, you would be withdrawn from. You would be excommunicated overnight, instantly.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4771s)

I think the instantaneousness of the whole Aberdeen thing is because they know it's so volatile.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4779s)

Yes, so dangerous to them.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4782s)

Yeah, we know that this is the real, this is the real, this is the incontrovertible crap that will set the whole thing up in flames if anyone believes it. Yeah. And it is. I mean, there were multiple people in that room, in the bedroom. If we go back, let's just go back, not dealing with all the crap that he said in Preston, not all him [kissing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4812s) all the young ladies and squeezing their tits, like not all that shit. Let's avoid all that for the moment and just talk about when the brothers entered his room. There were multiple brothers there who saw Madeline naked, saw JT Jr. naked. And you're going to believe that didn't happen or that this was somehow God's will? That is complete, that is so stupid. It's beggars belief that people believe it. I can't believe I believed it.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4848s)

I mean, it wasn't worth making a fuss about.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4856s)

At some point, yes, no, exactly. It's like, no. I mean, I have relatives who are like, "No, like it was so egregious, it was so obvious, it was witnessed to by so many people, why would we even talk about it? Of course not, we're going to move on."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4876s)

I was talking to an ex-member a couple weeks ago and he said we got talking about Aberdeen. Oh, we lost him. I got talking about Aberdeen and he said that he's like, "I honestly thought Aberdeen was just a swear word." He's like, "I didn't realize it was a place." He's like, "I grew up thinking it was just a swear word."

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4895s)

Funny. Oh, it's kind of funny. Anyhow, well, we lost Bradley.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4904s)

That was valuable stuff that Bradley had. Some of that I didn't know. He's a...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4913s)

Wise, wise man. Well, I guess, thank you Bradley for joining us and David for joining us and letting us dive into this. I will attach the link of the transcript. I'm not sure all what we're going to put up, so just look below in the description of what we end up deciding on attaching them to here. And thank you...

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4936s)

For eunice joining us too. Yes, she just brings a smile to my face.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4944s)

She's had her evening medication mixed with ice cream, but it actually makes her very sleepy.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4956s)

Okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4957s)

Well, until next time everyone, thank you for watching and we will do a part two if one is required from our feedback. Much love to you all.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4970s)

Thank you so much for what you're doing. Sometime I'm going to hook up with you on FaceTime when you're ready.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4977s)

Yeah, sure. We could do that. We could do that very shortly if you like. Okay.

### [**David Shorto**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatwIVfjW94&t=4982s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
