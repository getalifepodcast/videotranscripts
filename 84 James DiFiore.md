## Summary

In the beginning, James created the ex-peeb podcast!
The concept of the Get-A-Life podcast, surprisingly, did not originate with former members, but with a controversial journalist from the backwoods of Ontario – James DiFiore – who became so intrigued by the malevolent and vindictive cultists behind the Klondike Papers scandal, that he dedicated a whole series of his Blackballed podcasts to interviewing the victims of the PBCC. His hard work, research and perseverance sparked the interest of the leading Canadian investigative podcaster Canadaland, leading to the Ratfucker podcast series that exposed Gerald Chipeur and Brad Mitchell to well deserved national public humiliation, and also inspired Carman, Cheryl, Lane and Richard to launch a new podcast channel dedicated to former member’s stories; Get-A-life Ex-cult Conversations. In this episode, we ask James what motivated him to target the PBCC, then we take a trip down memory lane, reviewing the remarkable series of interviews that Blackballed conducted – many of them shocking and tragic, some humorous and heartwarming and some just very bizarre…

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DTxfO5AbltH8%26t%3D9s)

Everyone, welcome back to the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm Cheryl, and I am here with Richard and a very special guest that everybody has been wanting on for a long time, James DiFiore. Welcome, James.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=22s)

Hi, Cheryl. Hi, Richard. How are you guys?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=25s)

This has been a long time coming to have you on here, so we're grateful that you joined us.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=31s)

I'm happy to be here. Thank you for inviting me, I appreciate that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=33s)

You know, we are winding down this year and we really wanted to give a huge shout-out to you for the absolute platform and foundation that you have given ex-members. Get-A-Life podcast would not be sitting here doing this had it not been for you. It just wouldn't have happened. So today, I want to just put it all together. I want people to see [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=64s) much you have done for Get-A-Life.

And we're going to go through a lot of the podcasts that you have done with us. But first of all, there is this big, huge question that everybody asks us when they hear about James DiFiore and they jump onto Blackballed and they start scrolling through all the ex-members you've had on and everything that you've delved into the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And the question is, why? Why does someone want to [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=94s) on ex-members, for one thing? Why would you pick the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and decide to be like, "Hey, help these guys out?" What ever prompted you to take on a cult like this?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=109s)

I wish I could say it was for the money, but as much as they think inside that there is, there is no money.

I don't really think I picked, it's a good question actually, because I don't really think I picked the Plymouth Brethren. Like, I didn't think to myself, "There's a lot of cults, let's pick one." It landed on my lap when we heard about the David Wallace, Richard Marsh thing. I had known David previously years ago from when he worked me over during the Patrick Brown scandal, true story. And if I'm getting the chronology right, I met Richard through [David](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=146s), and then I heard of you through Richard and started to talk to you.

I just thought your story was so compelling, and it was attached to an organization that I had never heard of before but was amazed, perplexed, and infuriated that not only did they have all these cozy relationships with conservative politicians worldwide, but that they also, like many other sects of Christianity and other religions I assume, [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=176s) really awful in how they handled family situations and sexual abuse and oppression of women and things like that.

So I thought to myself, this is not something I'm an expert in. My claim to fame for a religion is that I hate it, right? So it wasn't fueled by any desire to right a wrong in how religion was being used, but because I was able to speak with Richard firsthand and yourself firsthand, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=207s) and a bunch of others, it just made me feel like this was something worth fighting for. Or at the very least, it was worth giving people an opportunity to speak about their experiences.

And really, I thank you for all that intro stuff, that's really humbling and everything, but personally, the way I feel about it is that you are brave, Richard is brave, all these people that came out, Lane and others, to tell their story. All I did was ask the questions and let people talk. And so [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=238s) always feel like you guys did me a favor rather than the other way around.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=241s)

So kind of in summary, you were wandering through the woods, you find a sleeping grizzly bear, and you get a gnarly stick and poke it up its anus just to see what happens, is that it?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=251s)

I guess that's a metaphor, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's a metaphor. But no, it was really the incestuous relationship with politics that solidified it for me. Not that your stories would have been any different or any less compelling, but I feel like the hubris that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has, and that self-righteousness that it has, is due in large part to the fact that they feel like [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=281s) untouchable because of these cozy relationships that they have.

And so that made it extra compelling. And then of course, Cheryl, you came on the show and that sort of set it off for ex-members. I think the courage that you showed because of the tragic story that you have, I think made others feel a lot more willing and comfortable to come forward and to talk to me. So I really owe you guys money. So I'll give you 100% of what I've made since I stopped recording the podcast.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=315s)

It's interesting you say that because, you know, there's lots of cults and lots of organizations that treat their own people very badly. But the fact that the Brethren are messing with politics, it's actually affecting everyone. You know, it's not just the Brethren and their members and their ex-members, it's actually screwing up the whole country.

And you know, when it comes to these PPE scandals where they're taking, I mean, you know, [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=345s) use the word "billions" lightly, but actually billions, actually billions of public money, it's taxpayer money. And I know none of us earn enough to actually pay taxes, but a lot of people actually do pay taxes. And it's ending up in these guys' pockets, thanks to these political connections. So we're doing the whole country a favor by exposing this stuff. It's not just about helping ex-Brethren.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=375s)

I'm surprised that there hasn't been a media outlet that's just carried the torch for this story. Because of the era that we live in of how politically correct things kind of are right now, I am surprised that a writer hasn't decided, or a reporter, you know, to put out the headline, "Group notorious for oppressing women and covering up sex abuse receives billions of dollars in government contracts." Like, this is, I thought that was the era that we lived in, but this story is [proving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=405s) that I guess there are exceptions.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=408s)

You know a lot about politics. I mean, you've been in it for a while. Like, why do you think that mainstream media is not picking this up the way that they should be?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=421s)

Gerald Chipeur.

And I have some experience of what it's like to have a story spiked for political reasons. It was in 2018, I was investigating a story about a certain CBC anchor who has since retired, has hair like me. And the story was that the CBC, with public money, paid to silence the mistresses that he had throughout the years that also worked in the newsroom at CBC.

And it was going well. I was hired by Postmedia, I was doing it for the National Post. And after two weeks, I get a call from my editor who asked me if I knew who Jamie Watt was, and I said yes, he's the person that runs this crisis management firm called Navigator. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=476s) he said, "Jamie Watt called us and apparently you called one of this anchor's ex-employees and was really hard on her." And I'm like, "I was just asking her questions, I was not very hard on her at all." In fact, for James standards, I was downright peachy with her, you know, like I was very polite.

But long story short, they canceled my contract during that phone call. All it took was a phone call from someone powerful, Jamie Watt, to the legal department.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=507s)

Who is Gerald Chipeur?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=508s)

Gerald Chipeur is the General Counsel for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. He used to be the General Counsel for the Conservative Party of Canada and Stephen Harper's personal attorney, if I'm not mistaken. I believe he was also at one time Pierre Poilievre's personal attorney. That could be wrong, but I thought that that was the case. Either way, let's just go with the first three.

And so, just to circle back to your question, the answer that I would give you is that if a legal department, [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=539s) the Plymouth Brethren are contacted by a reporter and someone wants to do a story, I feel like it's highly likely that that person would contact some higher-up in the Plymouth Brethren who would contact Gerald Chipeur. And then Gerald Chipeur, former attorney for the Prime Minister, would then call the lawyers at the National Post, Toronto Star, whoever, Postmedia, and be like, "I don't think you want to do this."

And lawyers are weird, there's a whole hierarchy and the way [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=569s) they relate to one another. If you're just coming out of law school, you might as well be the rookie on the hockey team who has to go fetch everyone's lunch and gets hazed and all that. But someone as renowned as Gerald Chipeur calling the legal department of the Toronto Star or Postmedia is probably all it takes for them to then call the editor and be like, "You have to spike the story."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=588s)

And he was the guy who was hired to, well, I mean, he was hired to find me, and he then in turn hired David Wallace. Yeah. And you know, so he was the kind of the evil genius behind the whole thing. And even going back nearly 20 years, he was hired to bring down one of the predecessors of Get-A-Life, which was, you know, it wasn't a podcast, it was a website, peebs.net. And he spent, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=618s) don't know, seven or eight years hunting down this guy in Vermont who had published, you know, by today's standards, a very mild website criticizing the Brethren. So he's the Brethren's attack dog lawyer.

I mean, there's one point I want to make here that lawyers, you know, people say all lawyers are bad. I mean, there's good lawyers, there's bad lawyers. Even bad people, even criminals should have a lawyer to defend them. But there's a certain class of lawyers whose job is to attack innocent people. And Gerald Chipeur comes into that category. And that's a very, very dirty business indeed. The people [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=663s) go after, they know they are innocent, and yet they'll use every twist of the law that they can to oppress and try and drag people down.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=673s)

Yeah, that's kind of, I feel like what will be their undoing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=676s)

Yeah, you know, exactly. Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=678s)

That need to save face or something, you know? Like they just, and again, that's the hubris though, that they literally feel like they don't have to answer for anything. "Why should we have to answer for..." It's like ex-wife syndrome. Just no accountability whatsoever. I'm just speaking for myself. Don't send me emails.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=701s)

Yeah, well, exactly. I mean, when the leader of the church is certified to be infallible, then obviously there's no accountability because he can't do anything wrong.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=712s)

The funny thing is, he is showing signs of weakness. I mean, they have the universal meetings going on this weekend.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=718s)

Oh, right now, actually. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=721s)

Right now, as we are recording this. Oh, how I wish I knew a hacker that could patch us right in, screen on screen. Supposedly his usual hour-long sessions are only half an hour right now, and he seems off.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=737s)

Now, you don't wish him dead or anything, do you? You wish him dead?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=742s)

No.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=743s)

I think it would be better if he just lived a long, suffering life, right? Like, what did Mother Teresa say about pain and suffering? "Those are just kisses from Jesus" or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=755s)

Yeah, yeah. One of the sequels to *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, I think was called *The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul*. I think we could wish him that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=768s)

They pray for our death out here. I don't wish that on them.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=772s)

No, you can't, because then you become them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=775s)

Yes, and that's not the point. But what's going to... I mean, nothing, we're not going to get anything done by that, right? The thing is, I want him, my hope in all of this is that he watches and hears enough of this that it breaks him down to become... He just needs to get to the truth. Let's just get to the truth.

The thing is, it would be so easy to turn things around in there. It really would. Accountability brings change. The thing is, they're so afraid of change in there that they block out their accountability. And yeah, you would just be like, "Okay, you know what? This happened, this happened, this happened. And let's bring in the police, let's deal with this pedophile, let's deal with this situation, let's deal with this wife-beater, let's deal with all of this."

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=824s)

You don't think that would kill the cult? You don't think that if you strip away accountability, then eventually, the more you want to unpack it, the more likely it will be that people will leave?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=836s)

Yeah, but the thing is, when true accountability happens, yes, there's going to be chaos no matter what. But change will happen out of that. It gives this opportunity for an actual mainstream Christian church to be birthed out of it. Absolutely. There's going to be people that leave it, right? Absolutely.

The thing is, he needs to go back to what is diseasing the whole cult, right? What's diseasing the church that makes it this cult. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=866s) if he could just sit back and realize, "Hey, you know, someone, I just got a report of, you know, this pedophile that's been abusing this child or these children," just take care of him. People will respect that. The way that they try and save face is why they are in the predicament they are in. You know, if they would just deal with the situation. I understand that this isn't the first cult that's had this kind of a situation. I mean, you hear this in all the cults, right?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=896s)

Well, you never hear about the other cults having all this political cash.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=900s)

No, and that's kind of what I wanted to talk about today. What do you think it would take to separate politics from religion? Because they use each other, right? They know that they need each other. What do you think it would take to separate that? I mean, this is a long-standing issue we have on this planet.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=922s)

Yeah, that's a million-dollar question. In a way, there is a cushion between them and the government, and these are these companies, these UBT companies. So they can, and I'm sure they do, easily argue that the companies have nothing to do with the church, right? I think that's what they try to sell. Even though when you work at one of their companies, you can't eat lunch with a member of the Plymouth Brethren Church.

That's a good question. I wish I had the answer [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=952s) we have enshrined in our rights a freedom of religion and expression. But we also have, not in Canada, but in the United States, they have this doctrine basically of separation of church and state. It's spelled out. And in Canada, I don't think we really have that. I don't think we have it spelled out like that. I could be wrong about that. I don't know if in the Charter of Rights it says anything about secularism or whether or not we have to build a firewall between church and state. I think most people just assume [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=982s) we should.

But one way of possibly really kind of putting the gears to religious groups would be to stop making them exempt for things like property taxes. Yeah, exactly. Make them account for the money they receive. The most blatant examples of robbery that I can think of in my life are two things. One is the mafia going to the mom-and-pop stand and getting protection money. And then the other thing are those fucking baskets that they pull out [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1013s) the Catholic church, anyways.

Because that's what, and I used to watch people throw money in there, and it was like, and I'd just watch it go to the back and I would literally imagine myself just like, yeah, like I'm in the money, you know? Because there's no accountability for it. Do you think it all gets reported? No. Does any of it get reported? Are they even supposed to? I don't know how any of it works. I wish I was a little bit more up to speed on that. But that would be my first thing. I would force an [audit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1043s), like a monthly audit, never mind every five years or something, a monthly audit for churches and religious organizations that are tax-exempt. And I would waive the property tax thing. And I'd say, "Take it out of your donations, if you really, like, you know."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1058s)

Yeah, and not just the property tax, the whole charitable status. I mean, the point about a church like the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is that, yeah, they've got this little charity wing, which in financial terms, compared to their total income, is tiny. It's like 2% of the money they take in tax-free goes to RRT. The rest is all internal to the church. Well, fine, give them tax exemption on the 2%, but tax them on the 98%.

[Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1088s) the fact is, there's no... the lines between business and religion and charity have all got so blurred that I think they should treat every religion as a business, except for the areas in which it specifically can prove that the money it's spending is for charitable purposes. And that would just, I think that would solve the whole problem overnight.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1110s)

I did a story once, like maybe 2007, and I wanted to know what it would be like to be attempted to be recruited by Scientology. So I don't know if it's still there or not, but there was a Scientology place on Yonge Street near Dundas, I think. And I was kind of wondering, I was looking in the window, you know, and sure enough, someone tapped me on the shoulder and showed L. Ron Hubbard's book about Dianetics and then sat me down.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1140s) I held the cans, and you know, here's the thing about the cans, you know what they really are? It's like the same technology as a lie detector, it just shows spikes in your pulse. That's all it really is, right? Yeah. And so they said, "Think of something that's really upsetting to you." And I had just had a bad breakup, and when I thought of it, I saw the thing fly, right? Like the needle flew up. And that's when the grift starts, right? They're like, "Those are the Thetans, yeah, trying to escape your body. You're holding them in. We can help you. And [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1171s) the price list."

Yeah, and then I went in and there's just like a 10-page contract that they want you to sign right away before you can join, and it asks for your mother's banking information and things like that. Wow. I'm sitting in this room with this book and this, like, I called it an exam, it was that long. And I just left, and I put the paper up my shirt and left the book there and I left. They fucking, like, followed me out of the building and started walking behind me, and I just turned [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1202s) and I'm like, "You don't want to walk behind me." Like, I just acted crazy for a second and they were like this, and then I left.

I wish I still had that sheet of paper though, it was crazy. But here's the point I'm trying to make, is that they sat, a very, very long-winded way to make this point, is that the property that they had would have been $1.1 million a year in property taxes because of how valuable the real estate was, and they never had to pay a cent. Right? Yeah. So that is the kind of thing that I think is, it [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1232s) chip away at this.

But honestly, the poison pill for the PBCC, to me, is their relationship with politics because it's unlike anything I've ever seen, except maybe the Catholics. But that was really more about donating to Catholic charities, that wasn't really about Catholic businesses. This is totally unique in that regard. I don't know how many Jehovah's Witness businesses there are or Scientology businesses there are that are completely funded by governments, and that's where they're unique, I think. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1260s)

You did the podcast just recently with, um, *Canadian Politics is Boring*, and I'm listening to it, and I'm not sure if it was you or if it was one of the hosts that had said, we were talking about Stephen Harper, and somebody had said that it's got to go far beyond who Stephen Harper and Pierre Poilievre are. Like, the track record of them being involved in politics has to extend beyond that. And I've never thought of it until I had heard it like that, and I'm like, "Absolutely, of course it would have had to, right?" I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1290s) Stephen Harper was when it was first blown up into media, when everybody showed up in the front row of his victory speech, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1301s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1301s)

Like, did that fit with you? Do you think it's gone beyond, like, how far back do you think this could extend to?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1308s)

I think probably provincially, we may have seen that it went far back, but I can't really, I mean, I don't know the answer to that, first of all. But I don't remember Brian Mulroney's government being really socially conservative, you know? And so I think that that's kind of a necessary trait in order to be partners with the PBCC.

My short answer is I don't know how far back it went. But my second answer is I don't think it goes as far back in Canada as maybe we would like to think. Because, you know, they've been around here for so long, maybe it was concentrated more municipally back then. That's a possibility because of how entrenched they are in whatever locality that they're in. So I could see like whatever region [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1356s) municipality, you know, Maple Creek falls under, there might have been something there.

But federal government and provincial government, I think it was a lot less, if it was even there at all. I think you're right, I think it blew up with Stephen Harper. It's funny though that even when you say that, and I say that as well as I repeat what you just said, is there is no mainstream knowledge of the swearing on the bible or the people in the front row. It's not common knowledge even to this day. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1386s) they have managed to still be able to sort of hide who they really are. Again, I think because Gerald Chipeur calls other lawyers at media companies and says, "Don't do this," and they just listen. You know, so something's gonna have to change in that world. Maybe Gerald Chipeur's untimely death or dementia might finally bring all this to light, you know. I'm not threatening, I'm not...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1410s)

The Brethren didn't really, it was Bruce Hales who brought the Brethren into politics in a big way. He kind of started in, what, in the late '90s. And then there was a Liberal government in Canada at that time. And it was only when Harper got in, with the Brethren's help, that they actually had that contact in government, that leverage in government, which they've been exercising ever since. And partly the reason they hate Trudeau is not because [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1440s) hate his policies, it's just because they've got no grasp on him. They've got no control of the guy. They want the guy that they own in his place. They don't really care what Trudeau does. He's just blocking the throne from their guy.

Another interesting thing I found out very recently about Chipeur is that back when, you know, there was kind of a crisis in the Conservative Party in Canada, it kind of was split into two pieces, wasn't it? There was the Reform Party and the Conservatives, and the only way they could win was to unite them. Chipeur was absolutely key in the formation of the modern Conservatives. And he was also absolutely key in persuading Stephen Harper to run for prime minister.

[There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1488s) was a meeting held at Gerald Chipeur's house in which they dragged Stephen Harper in. And it was Gerald Chipeur and Ezra Levant and a few other people. And they basically put him under a whole lot of pressure and told him, "Look, you've got to run for PM." And that meeting was held at Gerald Chipeur's house, which gives you an idea of, you know, he's like the kingmaker in conservative politics.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1512s)

That's the same meeting where Ezra Levant decided not to run in the riding that he...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1517s)

Yeah, and then Ezra Levant drops out to let Stephen run. And of course, Ezra Levant and Gerald Chipeur were partners together in the same law firm, or whether he was, it was Chipeur Advocates was the law firm, and Levant was working for them along with Jonathan Dennis, who, you know, so he's right embedded in the power structure of the Conservative Party. And then of course, Gerald Chipeur is the business partner of Pierre Poilievre [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1547s) the robocalls business. So you know, he's always there. There's this ugly, ugly face lurking in the background. But you know…

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1559s)

He’s like...only without all the charm and good temperament.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1561s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1562s)

You know, I don't really get involved in politics, I really don't. But there's one thing that doesn't sit with me right now, and I'm just going to speak this out to the ex-members that I know of here in Canada that are really wanting Pierre in as prime minister. It's not a good idea, right? Like, I am nowhere on the spectrum. I don't consider myself left, I don't consider myself right, I don't even want to consider myself. All I know is that when I see ex-members promote Pierre, I want you [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1592s) understand you're promoting money getting back and power getting back into the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

It's just anybody conservative at this point in time that has a history with Chipeur, has a history with Stephen Harper, is a bad move for the movement that we are trying to do. And I'm not going to lie, I'm going to go on a little bit of a show around here. It really frustrates me and hurts when I have conversations with people about [Harper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1622s), Harper, Harper, Harper, and oh, all this thing is how this ties that the PBCC have in with the Conservatives. Yet I see posts that they make and conversations that they have of supporting Pierre. Come on, you guys, buck up.

Like, if you are going to be advocating for Pierre to come in as prime minister here in Canada, you are literally putting an open pocket into the PBCC. Because maybe it might not be necessarily just Pierre, but he, [Pierre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1653s), like anybody in that group, is going to be having a line, the pockets are going to all line up. So I just caution you and understand what it is that you think you need. You're all tired, tired of Trudeau. He's tired of Trudeau here, we're all tired of him, especially here. I mean, we are. But come on, like, understand what it is.

For me, my whole purpose of doing what I'm doing is to try [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1683s) unravel the PBCC for the safety of my family, my nieces, my nephews, future generations. That's where my allegiance lies right now. That's why I do what I do. No way in hell would I tick Pierre Poilievre's name on a box. That goes completely right up against the movement that we are trying to do. So I'm just putting that out there to the members, to those people who are saying that they are supporting me and what we're [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1713s) and the movement that we are trying to do. Yet I see all these posts time after time after time supporting Pierre. It just doesn't... so I just suggest that you do your research, you understand who Pierre's connections are, and I'm not saying vote for Trudeau. I mean, I know we don't have many choices. But the thing is, if you're voting for Pierre, you are voting for the PBCC.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1738s)

I always tell everybody to vote NDP because they haven't had a chance to wreck the family car yet. I think that they deserve one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1745s)

Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I just saw a post today on Twitter, on X, Stephen Harper is starting a fundraising campaign to get Pierre in. He's trying to collect half a million. So it's Stephen Harper, who's intimately connected with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, doing a fundraising campaign. Now, where do you think a lot of that half a million is going to come from? It's going to come from the PBCC. It's funneling straight in.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1772s)

Maybe we need to concentrate on finding out when this money is doled out, but in real time, because we always have to play catch-up, right? We always have to figure out, "Oh, the PPE contracts." We didn't really know about that until months and months later, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1788s)

Yeah, there's this crazy system whereby the PACs don't have to submit their accounts until after the election. I mean, that's just too late. They should have to get permission ahead of time to take the donation and get it signed off before they get the money.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1802s)

Exactly. But I guess what it would require, and this is where my mind goes, because I'm not made of this type of organizational skill, but it would require like finding out in the Ministry of Health in Alberta, federally or whatever, what are all the contracts coming up, what are they for, who's bidding on them. This information, I believe, is available in real time. I could be wrong about that. But looking out for it in hindsight kind of ruins it because already we're granted the money.

And you know, maybe we can start, honestly, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1832s) stupid our world is right now, we would probably have a better shot at ruining PBCC businesses through hashtags that trend rather than actual sound reporting. I'm not even kidding. Yeah, it's true. Or something, you know, and then put all the details underneath it in a little article or something like that. People would be like, "What do you mean? Oh my God, that's crazy." But if you said like six months later, "Did you know the money that they got through the border houses?" And everyone's already tuned out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1859s)

It's not news anymore, is it? Exactly. Yeah, no, it's very true.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1863s)

It's just, it's something that keeps me up at night. When I wake up in the middle of it, my mind goes to where we are sitting in Canada. What I'm trying, like what all of us ex-members have been trying to do, and yet, oh, I just, I do not trust Pierre. I do not trust Stephen Harper. And you know, the PBCC and the state that they are in right now, we have uncovered, need Conservative in more than [ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1893s) right now. They need it. They need that support in government to be able to not crumble the way that they know that they're going to start crumbling.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1902s)

Yeah. It's just watch.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1904s)

Please, please, please watch for the reasons why you're voting.

I know sometimes I just get to the point, I get very, very angry and I want to draw a line in the sand where I'm saying, "You know what? Don't come to me. Don't be coming to me when you're coming to me supporting all this, yet you're putting someone in power that is going completely up against what we are doing." 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1929s)

So it's nothing to do with their politics. It's nothing to do with their left-wing or right-wing. It's where they're getting their money and influence from.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1936s)

Yeah, you almost have to remove the whole politics part out of this, right? You have to remove it all out of it and just understand the logic of what's happening behind it, right?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1948s)

They should just vote for the People's Party, honestly. If they're conservative and they don't feel like the NDP or the Liberals are going to do it for them, just vote for Bernier's party.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1957s)

Yeah, what was it? ABC, Anything But Conservative.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=1960s)

Yeah, I do. One of the things I hate the most about Canadian politics is that revolving door between Conservatives, yes, and then what happens is everyone gets, so, people had Mulroney regime fatigue, right? So they voted in, well, at the time it was John Turner, like whatever, they had Mulroney fatigue and then they had Chrétien/Paul Martin fatigue. So they voted in Harper. And they had, then we all had Harper fatigue. So we voted in Trudeau. Now everyone has Trudeau fatigue. So we're going to vote in Poilievre.

It's funny because, I understand why people, I don't like the Trudeau government for various reasons. But I'm also not one of these people that is like the [sky's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2003s) falling because Stephen Harper or Trudeau is prime minister. What makes Poilievre different for me is that he does have connections that he will most certainly exercise with this cult. But also, Stephen Harper, whether you loved him or hated him, managed for a conservative to govern pretty close to the center, for a conservative person. You know, like he did a lot of things that were like, "Holy shit," like muzzling scientists and things like that.

But really, at the end of the day, did [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2033s) sky fall after the eight or nine years that he was in office? Or however long it was? Were we destitute as a nation? Were we ranked like last on the quality of life index? No, it was fine. Like, if you didn't like him, I didn't like him, that's great. Trudeau, same thing. Like, the sky's not going to fall because this guy's in office. But I think people are, we're entering an election cycle where you're not voting for anyone, you're voting against people. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2063s) even people that are ex-members of the PBCC that know that Poilievre has a bunch of deep contacts within that cult, they might plug their nose and vote for him because they hate Trudeau that much.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2075s)

And that's what frustrates me. It's just, like, I've literally cried over this. So I'm not going to, I actually wasn't even planning on talking about this today. I have literally...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2085s)

There's no crying in podcast, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2085s)

...how much it's affected me. It's because this is hours we put into this, just us volunteering our time trying to get this movement going. And then you have all these people that are supporting it, and then in the next breath, they hate Trudeau, so then they think their only option is Pierre. Well, I'm like, I just, I guess my point I'm reiterating again is if you vote for Pierre, I'm like, I am, I just draw that, I don't want to hear from you because you are supporting Bruce Hales. You are supporting UBT. You are supporting all those priests. You are supporting pedophiles. You are supporting all these people who are going to now be financed.

Maybe it's not Pierre directly, but Stephen Harper is hand in hand with Pierre, which makes the PBCC right there. We know the history and we know how much they are hurting right now. And they [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2140s) the Conservatives in in order to be able to survive. I'm just saying, please, like if you are genuinely concerned about supporting this movement that we've got going, just watch what you're doing. Just like, you've got to understand what you're doing. Don't do it because you hate Trudeau.

I mean, I was a hardcore conservative my entire life. My husband was in the oil patch, which made me, that just suited his job, right? It wasn't until I started uncovering all this, it was hard. It was hard for me to give up the conservative pushing, I guess. It was just easy to do that because it supported my husband's job. Never in my life would I ever go back to supporting someone who even has the slightest drop of maybe having an affiliation with the PBCC while it is in the state it is in.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2191s)

Yeah, I agree.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2193s)

Okay, I wanted to go on, we're just gonna move on here because we need to. I want to go through everything that you have helped us with. And I know that you don't like thinking that you've helped us. Once you see this, you're gonna realize why we are so grateful for you. So we're going to go through all, we're just going to go, we've got, there's like 40-some of them, so we're just going to quickly go through these.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2218s)

This is my favorite picture of Richard, by the way. It looks like he's confessing his love to me on a boat or something.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2225s)

Where was this taken?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2228s)

Oh, that was, that was Scarborough. Scarborough shoreline. Not Scarborough, UK, Scarborough, the Bluffs, yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2236s)

I remember that day.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2238s)

Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2238s)

No, I wasn't there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2241s)

So this is, I think this is the very first one you did, wasn't it?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2245s)

I believe it was. I don't know if you or Richard were first.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2248s)

No, Richard was before me.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2250s)

Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2252s)

I mean, this was just a picture you pulled from one of my old videos, I think. So this wasn't actually on the podcast, but this was where it started. And I'm looking suitably stressed and serious for the occasion.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2268s)

Then we get into...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2273s)

Yeah, yeah. So this is the podcast that caused a lot of problems, right? Because David and Nathan basically said that they were, in a roundabout way, asked to deal with or get rid of the Prime Minister, which I still don't think meant kill. I think it just meant by any means necessary get him out of office. That's what I thought it meant, but who knows? I don't know how deep the hubris is with the PBCC, but that was an interesting podcast to say the least.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2301s)

Absolutely.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2303s)

Yeah, and Nathan Jacobson at Plymouth Brethren Christians asked me to, what was it, "put down the Prime Minister," was it? I can't remember the rest of that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2316s)

You'd really like to take screenshots. Yeah. Yeah. I think the biggest takeaway from the Nathan Jacobson interviews is that Brad Mitchell had confessed, confessed isn't the word, Brad Mitchell had boasted about being behind that, what was it? The blackface thing? British Columbia. No, no, the school story. This rumor in the *Buffalo Chronicle* that got blown up.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2347s)

That was the one, Justin. Yeah, yeah, you were involved in that. I was one of the reasons that it, and listen, I apologized like the next day, but yeah, you're right. He confessed that. I don't know if he, I think maybe he was trying to take credit for something that wasn't his, because all the people that I heard it from, and I'm not trying to defend the PBCC, were all former Harper staffers. So I thought it was just the work of a Kory Teneycke type character or something like that. Like some operative that wanted to put it in the ether, knew the right people to call who would then pick [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2377s) the phone and call people like me who then would believe it, because dude, I had like four people that I didn't even think knew each other tell me the same story.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2385s)

Well, I found something interesting about it, because the *Buffalo Chronicle* is owned by some quite young guy who is not even Canadian, he's down in San Francisco in business there, which of course is where Rod Diplock is. Rod Diplock's extremely wealthy. So my theory is...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2404s)

Rod Diplock is a PBCC member, just for those... Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2406s)

Rod Diplock is one of the contacts, along with Brad Mitchell, who sort of organized my kidnapping. I think Rod Diplock and Brad Mitchell went along to the owner of the *Buffalo Chronicle*. And the, oh yeah, the other thing is the owner of the *Buffalo Chronicle* had actually advertised to do political hit jobs. He'd actually put an advert out saying, "If you want anyone taken down, come and speak to me." So I think Diplock and Mitchell went along to this *Buffalo Chronicle* editor in San Fran and basically gave him half a million and said, "Yeah, pull down Trudeau by any means you can." Maybe we need another podcast about that. They just dug up a really interesting breadcrumb trail that led back to that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2459s)

Yeah, so these are all the Nathan Jacobson podcasts. For those that haven't seen any of these, please go back on Blackballed and just start going through all of the podcasts that James has done with the PBCC information.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2478s)

Yeah, you can go to my YouTube page, basically, or Spotify, but there's no clips on Spotify, so the YouTube page has everything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2485s)

We can put the link after the podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2487s)

Yeah, I'll put the link to it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2489s)

Blackballed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2490s)

On here, yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2491s)

This picture was lifted from the documentary, I think, wasn't it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2494s)

Yeah, yeah, it was. Yeah, got my best shirt on.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2497s)

That was quite, you know, you're tripping me out a little bit. This is almost nostalgic because there was like a period of time from like May to like October where it was just like a few dozen, I think, podcasts that were PBCC.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2515s)

It was, that's all it was. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2518s)

Yeah, yeah. And by the way, I'm back now. Like, I'll be...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2525s)

And I really wanted to let people know, like, it's super important to let people know that you're back now and that they can reach out to you. And I just want to address the elephant in the room with James and his podcasts and ex-members. So what they, everybody talks about James's faith, you know?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2544s)

I don't have any faith.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2544s)

It's okay, it doesn't matter.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2548s)

Pray for me, go on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2550s)

It doesn't matter. I don't see why people get so caught up, that are hardcore Christians, that won't touch James and his podcast because James comes across as an atheist, doesn't have faith, doesn't believe, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2566s)

And I mean, when you grow up in the Brethren, you're taught that an atheist is something terrible. I mean, the word "atheist" is said with a special sort of intonation, the same way you speak about Satan. So, you know, it just scares people. And I mean, you have got, you know, you said that little pointy beard, James. It probably fed into the image.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2587s)

It was my devil beard, yeah, you're right.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2589s)

So, but well, listen...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2594s)

And that's fine. Like, even if I knew that I was having a guest on the show who hated my guts because of atheism, I would never bring it up. I don't think I've ever really insulted any guests for believing in what they believe in.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2609s)

You got a Christmas tree for goodness sake.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2609s)

I may have said something offhand where it's like, "Well, I mean, you know, we all know that heaven and hell doesn't exist, so that's a pity because he won't be going to hell." Like, I may have said something like that because that's who I am, but it should never be taken as a slight. It's not about that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2624s)

Right, this isn't about anybody's beliefs. This is about a movement that's happening. This is about an end goal that you poured your heart and soul out. And I mean, a good question is, I'm sure that these interviews and how much you have helped us has taken a toll on you at times. I'm sure it has. I mean, hearing the stories that you have heard, has it affected you? Like, does it take a bit?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2649s)

Sometimes it does because I also have experience with abuse as a kid, right? So sometimes it gets to the point where I need a break from it. Like, there was a stint last year where I think I did like a dozen shows in like three weeks, all PBCC, all ex-members, 90% of them were abused, you know, listening to the stories and whatever. And I noticed that I sort of held on to some of that [anger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2679s) and anxiety when I would go off air. And so I've taken breaks, like intentional breaks from it. But I think the best part is that I always say to myself, "Let's just get on with it and keep going."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2693s)

Exactly.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2693s)

I'm not going to stop doing the shows. I may just, you know, now I'm going to do them once a week kind of thing and keep it going like that, rather than four shows a week.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2702s)

Yeah, it is exactly. That's what we're doing too.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2703s)

And I don't want to make it sound like it drove me to medication or to the psychiatrist's office or anything, but it is very draining. Like, it can be very, and also the way I do the interview is conversational, so it's less mechanical and therefore more emotional, right? Like, I'm trying to connect with these people rather than read a question. And if you're successful at connecting with someone who's telling a really sad story, it has to make you sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2730s)

It's that emotional connecting while doing a podcast that just adds this fuel into the movement, right? Because people who are listening and viewing this, they feel that, and it is about the heart connection. It is about the emotional connection, but it does, I mean, it does take a toll. I've had many, many burnouts, but it's definitely, one a week is very manageable. Yeah, yeah. So I just want to put on here on the [screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2760s) right now, Carman Drever was also on James's podcast.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2763s)

A faith-based person who doesn't judge me for my atheism, by the way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2768s)

And again, shout out to Carman. Dennis is a very fervent Christian.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2774s)

Yes, and he was super nice and super, oh, he's so sweet, isn't he? Oh, and yeah, Dr. Lalich is like one of the most entertaining podcasts I think I've done because she was in a cult at one time, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2788s)

She said yeah, and for an academic, she was remarkably humorous. Did you remember she had to put off the podcast because she was attacked by a turkey or something? That's right, her dog was attacked by a turkey or something like that.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2802s)

And I was like, and I told her, I think I told her on the phone, I'm like, "I have to believe you because who would ever make up something like that?" Like, "My dog got attacked by a turkey." Okay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2812s)

It's kind of, well, what do they call it? Just desserts, because I mean, it's Christmas time and we're all attacking turkeys, so it must be fine just for, you know, one in a million times, turkey attacks person.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2826s)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2827s)

Don't question it, right? If anybody's not researched her, she's got some, she's got an excellent book on, I'm in the middle of reading hers right now.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2836s)

I see her on CNN, I see her on MSNBC, like she's...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2839s)

Very active right now. Yeah, yeah. And then we just went down, here's another very fervent Christian, right, Ron.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2846s)

I don't think he would ever come on my show anymore. No, I'm serious. I don't think, I've heard through the grapevine that he's not a big fan of mine. I thought the podcast went really well. You know, I didn't argue, I actually let him basically confess and ask for forgiveness. And I thought it was a very emotional conversation. At the end of this podcast, I remember being like a little bit choked up because I got off air and everything and I was like, "Imagine [putting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2876s) yourself in this person's shoes."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2878s)

Yeah, he was the enemy, right?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2879s)

And now the enemy is on camera talking about how he shouldn't have done the things that he did. I gave, you know, you got to give him credit for that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2890s)

Almost like the Nuremberg trials, perhaps. That's an unfortunate comparison, it might be a...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2896s)

...little bit of a stretch. And this is Richard in 30 years.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2901s)

Yeah, Richard Marsh Sr.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2902s)

Yeah, oh, he's such an incredible human. Oh, he's, I called him whimsical, I think. Just, yeah, I think that was my word. But that's your uncle, right, Richard Marsh?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2913s)

Yeah. Oh, speak of the devil.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2917s)

Yep, there he is. James rants over questions sent by the Western Standard to David.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2922s)

And that's Ezra Levant for anyone who doesn't know.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2924s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2927s)

And then Jackie Hart was on there.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2929s)

Yeah, who was the one that he interviewed that I made the whole thing funny, even though it wasn't a funny...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2936s)

Oh, that's never happened, James.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2937s)

No, no, this was like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2939s)

Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2940s)

...Miss Hamilton, and I did that intentionally because I was afraid of coming off insensitive. I don't remember what the reason was. I think I just wanted a light-hearted show that day. Yeah, and I was supposed to do a part two and I never did, so I should do a part two with Anne for sure. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2955s)

You never really got into the rest of Anne's story.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2958s)

No, and I should, I should have brought it back, but I just kept going.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2961s)

Yep, and then this is Michael Bachelard.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2964s)

Michael Bachelard is a great interviewer. I think I had him on twice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2967s)

And this was my favorite. Oh, I will, yeah, totally will play a clip of this after this. It just, this was so good. This was one of your best tracks. I loved it. Yeah, that was interesting.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2980s)

I wrote it in like five minutes, ten minutes or something like that. And I just, I can't remember what the reason was, why I decided to do it. It could have been mushrooms, but whatever it was, it was a fun, it was a fun track, you know, that's what they do.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=2996s)

Yeah, I mean, James is looking appropriately satanic in the picture there, isn't he? I mean, if they didn't crop the top of the picture, you'd see the horns pretty clearly, I think.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3006s)

I don't know if the headline said something like, "Atheist Saves Children," I could believe that too, somehow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3014s)

For those of you that haven't heard it, here's the clip of it. Three, two...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3026s)

*Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.*

*Way back in the day in 1848, this guy named John Darby set out to create a secret way of life where they would not associate with other types of people if those people didn't share faith.* 

*Baptized and scorned, families torn. The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is now officially born.* 

*Cult life is forever, and if you ever leave, you're vilified, ostracized, minimized pleas on receiving ends of lies.* 

*All the crooked eyes, all the last goodbyes to all your family ties. You can see it in their eyes, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3060s) vacant.* 

*Either you a Plymouth Brethren or you Satan. 55,000 deep, they make millions per week. Through the UBT, and they do not keep receipts.*

 *It's a score. Shit, I think I've seen the show before.*

 *Fat guy, envelopes of cash. Where's your pork store? Babies, indoctrinated and raped. An isolated disgrace.*

 *It's check the state of the faith. It's complicated complaints. It's all undefeated. You hate this place.* 

*As you stayed as a kid, we're never sacred. The doctrine of separation was written by psychopaths, snatching kids from [parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3090s) who decided that they wanna take a pass on pedophilia, molestation, manipulation, felony fraud. Bruce Hales, you're not a god.*

 *What kind of a god eats at the trough with the other pigs? Sloppy piece of shit gods and their piece of shit kids. Stealing food from the mouths of the kids you abuse. For a second mansion, a plane, and a yacht too.* 

*I assume you will soon speak with Jesus too. But shit, you got lust with Nosferatu at two. You blew Jesus like a Ronald McDonald. The business model, bravado. Providing bottomless [fodder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3121s) for bottom feeders.*

 *Beholding to the bottle. Bloated on the side of the road. It's twiddled up and it's cold. It's sort of a metaphor for out of control.* 

*Now rise up from the flames, crease away from the fold. Throw your locality up in the air. Set it on fire like you just don't care. Go on then, like a Bedouin, and turn around and lick a shot at the Brethren.* 

*Throw your locality up in the air. Set it on fire like you just don't care. Go on then, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3151s) a Bedouin. Now turn around and lick a shot at the Brethren.*

 *I got hope like Cheryl, but most of the time I just wanna bust a couple of barrels or a nine like De Niro or design war plans, attack the whole clan, make stacks from the old men who diddled and ran.* 

*Sinister plans include dark as shit in human nature, gay and in the Brethren they chemically castrate ya.*

 *You don't contribute dollars, you're sentenced to the bottom with weekly priestly visits that accentuate the problem.* 

*And hell on earth is Maple Creek, and I know [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3181s) hurts, but get off your knees and excise that cancer. The pedophiles dance to apathies.*

 *Now switch up the playlist. The chance to face this, it's more than a facelift. You're gonna need a spaceship if you are attempting to escape this.* 

*See through trees like you're blunted. And big ups to Richard Marshman, now the hunter is the hunted. Cause when that falls and the fat man crawls, someone please let him know he's not welcome on Blackballed.* 

*In fact, yo, I make it my mission, I will not rest until this motherfucking cult is out of [commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3211s).*

*So throw your locality up in the air. Set it on fire like you just don't care. Go on then, like a Bedouin, or turn around and lick a shot at the Brethren. Throw your locality up in the air. Set it on fire like you just don't care. Go on then, like a Bedouin. Now turn around and lick a shot at the Brethren.*

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3239s)

I'd like to give a big fuck you to Bruce Hales. Hi, Brucey.

Oh, there it is. Nathan Jacobson asked to take out Justin Trudeau. Maybe he meant take him out for dinner, you know?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3250s)

Interesting point there because this is the point where David and Nathan were talking about Putin having cancer. And just recently, there's been news articles that, what's wrong with Putin? His cheeks were all puffed up. So you know, maybe this is another of David's prophecies.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3274s)

David thinks Putin has been dead since like the spring, and I'm like, I believe that. He's like, "Of course I do." And I'm like, "You know how many doubles he has?" And I'm like, "I don't know. I don't know how many doubles he has."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3286s)

Yeah, the one with the double with the fat, would it still be called...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3288s)

...doubles if there were more than one?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3290s)

Well, that's a good question, isn't it? Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3292s)

Plymouth Brethren Church asked me to take out, just so that's that, the story that taking out was removed via scandal.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3301s)

Yes.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3302s)

But of course, it was sensationalized by, I guess I was part of the sensationalism. But no, I think I said on the podcast, I'm like, "Yeah, maybe that doesn't mean kill." You know, that'll be quite a story if it meant kill. Maybe someone else might pick up on it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3319s)

These are called in order, so I apologize. Plymouth Brethren farmers poison Aussies with bad spinach?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3328s)

Well, it's funny because in their recent business seminar, the Brethren were told by their own business gurus that there's a lot of money to be made in a crisis, and sometimes you need to make the crisis happen. So maybe this was a kind of a failed plot to poison half of Australia and then come up with some vaccine against poisonous spinach.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3351s)

As you can see with the headline of this one, I needed a headline writer. Cheryl Hope and Richard Marsh, “The PBCC's land scandal and grave desecration.” Like it was bad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3363s)

What is crazy, and do we have an update on that? Like, what has, have they fixed it? Do we know if they've gone through and actually restored this?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3372s)

Well, the last I saw, I mean, they'd put grass down, they'd put sod down over the whole area. And they got pegs for where they thought the gravestones used to be, and they're going to put the gravestones back. But I don't know if they've actually put the stones back. There was some dispute as to whether they'd put the pegs in the right place. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3392s)

I remember.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3393s)

But yeah, they basically had to reverse everything and put it back like it was. So that's a pretty good outcome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3402s)

Yeah, these aren't in order.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3404s)

Lance Christie interview, that was fun.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3410s)

Craig Hoyle, yeah, that...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3412s)

...was a great interview. Yeah, he was such an incredible...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3414s)

Yeah, he's so articulate. And he's got a new book out, just so everybody knows, called *Excommunicated*. So if you haven't...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3421s)

Oh.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3421s)

...that, definitely order it now.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3423s)

He was writing it when I talked to him, so yeah, that's good.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3427s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3427s)

I haven't received mine yet, so we're in Canada, so it's a little bit later. But yeah, once I've read it, we'll have him on Get-A-Life and we'll go through it. And Terri Smith, there she is, and joined in with all the Maple Creek fiasco. Yep. Heidi McCamley.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3446s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3446s)

Another ongoing battle in which her...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3451s)

...story is really sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3452s)

Yeah, such a sad story. We'll update when we can.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3454s)

Yeah. David Wallace, we still might do a podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3464s)

Yeah, what happened to his podcast? Like, you guys were starting a podcast or he was starting a podcast?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3470s)

Oh, just time and me being busy. I'm going to Milwaukee again in a couple of days. Just through freelance work and everything. So it's just a matter of getting it done. I might just do it all remote. I think David has a producer, so we might just do that. And we're going to do, I don't know what we're going to call it, but "Ratfucker" was what Jesse Brown used for his podcast series, but he lifted that from David. So we might do a series called "The Original Ratfucker" or "Ratfucker Origin Story."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3501s)

Just call it "Fuck Ratter." Or "Fat Racker."

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3505s)

"CanadaLandfucker." Oh, she's hilarious. Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3513s)

Yeah, again, her sense of humor.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3516s)

Is like, yeah, she's super funny. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3519s)

Such a sad story too, though. Yeah, she's just so, her perseverance though, right? Yeah, she's got such good...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3528s)

...perseverance. Oh.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3530s)

There's, yeah, there's Ann Hamilton. Yeah. So yeah, you have to do part two with her.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3534s)

This is weird, all this stuff coming back at me. Like, I remember, you know, I don't even know how many...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3539s)

That's why I wanted to do this, is to really show our viewers and listeners, and you, of like, really how much you have contributed to this movement to be what it is today. Lane Admiraal.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3553s)

Lane is the most photogenic ex-member of all time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3563s)

And then here's just another clip of "put me on ice."

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3566s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3567s)

The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church asked me to put Richard Marsh on ice.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3571s)

Maybe they meant Johnnie Walker.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3576s)

Could have been. Yeah, all open for interpretation, isn't it?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3581s)

Oh, there it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3582s)

Yeah, this is, well, this is my second one that I did with you. This is where, these are really not in order. I thought they were, but they're obviously not in order in the file. Yeah, so this is when Lane and I came on. And then yeah, this was, she worked for UBT. Yeah, actually had like direct, you know, conversation with the man, him, Man of God himself.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3607s)

Yeah, who called her a whore or something. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3611s)

Oh, and this was, this story broke my heart.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3617s)

I know, she's like Romeo and Juliet kind of.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3619s)

Right? She sincerely wanted in. Like, this was such a testament to the falseness of how they say anybody can join. Like, no, no, you can't. Yeah. So if you haven't watched her podcast, oh man, definitely watch her podcast. Yeah. Oh, this is when I was on after David Wallace on one podcast.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3643s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3644s)

I think it was after, I think it was after CBC put out their little clip. And Bradley McKCallum, who has been a core help to our movement with the history on Aberdeen. Again, another horrible story when you hear his. Oh, man, my heart broke when...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3664s)

...the way he was treated, yeah. Yeah, he's just done another podcast for us about the Aberdeen incident. I mean, he's a very, he's an excellent historian and researcher, and he's put together a really, really good podcast, which recommends...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3678s)

All the Aberdeen evidence.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3679s)

...yeah, everyone listens to that for sure.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3682s)

And Ben Woodbury from...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3685s)

Oh.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3686s)

...Windsor, Australia.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3687s)

Really fun to talk to as well. Ben was great. He was like exquisite, I would say, you know? Like the way that he handled the interview, really, like he was very thoughtful, articulate. Yeah, he was just a great guy to have on the show. Great personality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3704s)

Such a good personality. And if you don't follow him on TikTok, make sure you go find him on TikTok. He's known as "ex-cult boy." He has a huge following. Yeah, he's also got a YouTube channel.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3715s)

Oh, there we go. This is when we all came on. Wow, how come I don't have a Patreon? Right, this is just like, this is so much content. I didn't realize how much, this is like hundreds of hours of podcasts. And like dozens of articles. Yeah. I didn't realize. I didn't realize it was this. I mean, I sort of did, but I never thought of it, you know?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3746s)

I think too, James, you did a lot of articles on some of these podcasts as well as the podcast itself that you did, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3756s)

Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of written work, which is really good. I love your writing on that. I mean, we maybe should put it all together into...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3763s)

Yeah, I think that too. We should put it all together. ...a site or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3767s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3767s)

Yeah, so that people can, yeah, of course you can send...

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3769s)

...money, why not? Is that what you said?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3771s)

What's that?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3773s)

I said, "Of course you can send me money," right? I'm just kidding about the money.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3777s)

You can have 50% of everything I've earned, James.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3780s)

That's right. No, the money thing is funny because I never think of the money when I do these stories. Because it's the first time where I've, this literally is the first time that I've done so much content on one thing because I felt like, not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3799s)

Yeah, exactly. And that's what's so genuine and authentic about your involvement with this whole movement. It had no ulterior motive. It just was, you were drawn into it, it landed on your lap, and away you went with it.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3814s)

So I thought I was going to get sued 100 times between when I started and now. I really did. Because there was like, "Why are all these other people getting sued but I'm not? Don't they think I'm compelling enough to sue?"

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3826s)

Well, I mean, I think one of the answers there is that Ontario actually has some of the strongest anti-SLAPP laws on the planet. So you're actually in a good place if you want to produce this kind of content. I mean, either here or in the USA, but it's, you know, they can kind of pretend to take a suit against you in Alberta, but it doesn't have any effect in Ontario.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3849s)

Ah, Peter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3849s)

And this is Peter Hart, he was on.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3852s)

Yeah, that probably might be one of the guys that doesn't like me. Just saying, we don't have to talk about it. Let's move on.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3862s)

This might be one of the guys that doesn't like you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3864s)

Yeah, this guy definitely doesn't like you.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3867s)

You think he knows who I am? This guy who's here?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3870s)

I'm sure he does. I'm sure he does. Yeah, I think he's got a dartboard that looks like his nemesis, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3876s)

This is the podcast we did and released the audio, was it Strive 23, I think?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3883s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, could you do an Australian accent, James? What was it, "The half of my goods I give to the poor," remember that?

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3893s)

Yeah, Bruce. I can't do an Aussie accent. Dean Blundell can do a really good Aussie accent.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3897s)

Oh, so this is at the very beginning again. Look at Richard.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3900s)

Richard, you look like a punk rocker. You look like you like to sing Radiohead covers. Yeah, Radiohead is the band, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3908s)

It's not hair, it's just the band of my earphones.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3914s)

So this is when David Wallace was on with you. And then this is Damian Hastie

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3920s)

Oh, I love, shout out to Damian, man. Absolutely, yeah. Hardest working man in, you know, in the PBCC universe, I think, right? Like, just the amount of work that he does.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3931s)

He has put in so much work. And again, like you, James, he has no ulterior motive other than to expose what he is realizing isn't being exposed. Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3941s)

Yeah, you know what I was thinking? I was an ideal person to get all engrossed in this because of my criticism of religion and my interest in politics. Because it's literally just those two things smushed together. And I don't know very many other subjects in this world that I'm interested in that have that two-pronged sort of attraction. Oh, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3964s)

Another horrible story. She's such a survivor, another huge survivor.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=3970s)

Yeah, Laura is. She's also one of the first guests where it dawned on me that the strange and kind of impressive way that victims of this cult have a tendency to forgive their perpetrators. Mostly because she knows that her perpetrator probably was abused him or herself. And that to me, like, I walked away from this interview thinking about a lot. This is one of those interviews that resonated. I think I took a, I may be mistaken, but I feel like I took a break after this one because, you know, I was trying to wrap my head [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4007s) that whole thing. Like, "Well, how much strength does it take to tell your story?" But then, "How much additional strength does it take to say that you forgive the person that did this to you because the same thing probably happened to him?" That was really, yeah, you know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4019s)

This was a really hard story to listen to. And you know, she's doing great. She's still on, you know, she still speaks to a lot of ex-Brethren, helps them and encourages them. But yeah, you know, we don't want to, just because this interview was a long time ago, we mustn't forget that this happened and that there has not been justice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4040s)

Yeah, and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this. Because we have, I mean, Get-A-Life has got, I mean, this is going to be podcast, I think, is it 83? I don't even know. And so I think it's important that we remember all of these survivors who have had the courage to come on and tell horrifying stories, that we still think of you. Right? You're still, you're still always on our mind. And I think it's important that we do this kind of reminiscing and [remind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4070s) people of why we do what we're doing, who we're fighting for.

And it's just, it's super important to not lose sight of some of the really horrible stories of people that, I mean, we, I battle all the time. Even though we can come on, like she puts this brave face on, you think of Beth Seed, like all these horrible stories, Craig Hoyle, Bradley, and my, like, we put these brave faces on to fight this fight, but in fighting the fight, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4101s) takes an added amount of determination and passion and resilience because you're in it all the time. It's not like you've put your story out there and then you've gone on your life over here. It's not, you're in it all the time because you are interviewing people that have very similar stories to yourself. And so I do, I just want to give a shout-out to all those survivors that have come on Get-A-Life and have gone on to Blackballed, that we hear you, we're with you, and we see you with everything, helping us fight the fight. Like, I know what you're going through.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4134s)

And another point I'd like to make is that the Brethren, and particularly the Brethren leadership, watch all of these videos. They watch all of Get-A-Life. They watch all the Blackballed videos you do. And think of how many horror stories that have been brought out on there. And not a single one of those victims have the Brethren had the decency to come forward and say, "Well, we didn't know what had happened and, you know, this is horrific and is there anything we can do to help and we're sorry about it?" [Absolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4165s) silence. So they know all this has happened and they've just been blanking it out.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4171s)

Yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah. You know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4176s)

Again, part of the Ratfucker series.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4178s)

I had Jesse Brown on too for the Ratfucker stuff.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4181s)

You did, yeah. Jesse and Charisse, yeah. Yeah.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4184s)

I mean, I traded him. He hates my guts, but I traded him. I'm like, "If you come on the show, I won't scoop you on the Nenshi story that I know is the subject of your second podcast." He's like, "Fine." Thank you for that. That was like overwhelming, almost. Like, I can't believe that I've done that many podcasts. I guess I can believe it, but you know, it is really the niche. You know what a lot of people have told me? They've said, "You should only do that. [Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4214s) do ex-cult members, not just Plymouth Brethren, but other religions and other cults, whatever." And I don't think I could, you know? I could if it was like once a week and then that's it. But I want to do, when I do podcasts, I usually want to do three, four, five shows a week because I just want to. But I can't do that many shows on that particular topic.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4233s)

No, mentally, mentally you wouldn't be able to do it.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4235s)

In order to take a break from the horrific stories of the Plymouth Brethren, I interviewed the reporter who broke the Jeffrey Dahmer story. So that gives you an idea. That gives you a little bit of an insight of like what your break was, hey? That's right. Yeah. Awesome. Well, it's been a real trip though, you guys. Like, it's been, I'm really happy that your podcast is doing so well. I watch it almost all the time. I'm, you know, I'm really, I like the idea of knowing that, well, I could never take credit for the things that you guys do and how you stood up for things. I like being a cog in that wheel, you know? Just because it makes me feel, you know, that something I've done was worth [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4281s), you know? That's another thing about this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4283s)

Yeah. I would have never, James, like, I would have never, ever started this. I would have never, this is the last thing, if somebody had come to me and said, "Hey, like, Cheryl, you're gonna start a podcast," I'd be like, "You're out of your mind." I have lived in a cave, a shell, for like 30 years. I'm like, "No way." And it was, I think it was helping you get the members on, it was being on, coming on and getting more comfortable. And then till just one day, we just started talking to Richard on the phone, it was just like, "I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4314s) I think we need to do this, right?"

I think, and I would have never done it had you not shown me that this was possible, that this was needed, right? And I think that's super important that we stay working and doing this side-by-side because you do draw in a different crowd than we draw in, right? And I really, really encourage the ex-members who have not gone on your show to tell their story, that I think it's super important because all exposure, on whatever shape or format you can do, whether [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4344s) a book, whether it's a podcast, whether it's whatever it is, it's super important to get it out there right now when we've just hit them with all this Aberdeen stuff. And I know it's really opened up a crack inside there from what the inside is reporting back to us, that this Aberdeen is an issue. So I just say, stand on this foundation that we've created and let's continue feeding this crack in there so that something does happen. Yes, people try [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4374s) move away from, "You know, why are you guys doing this? Like, let's just let the things rest. Let the past rest." The past is never going to rest.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4383s)

The past is the present.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4384s)

Exactly. If you do not, if we don't deal with the past, that church is going to take hold of things that we don't want them to take hold of. And it is us coming forward and exposing what really is going on in there that is going to make this change.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4402s)

And if there's religious members, like ex-members who are religious and don't like my lack of faith, I'm the type of person where you can tell me that on the phone or in an email and just be yourself and just be like, "Listen, if I come on your show, can we just not like, trash religion?" I will absolutely say yes. It's not really, it's not because it's not about that for me. Like, I'll trash religion on casual Friday, do you know what I mean? Like, I won't do [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4432s) in front, I won't do it for a guest that I know believes.

I don't think I've, look, I might have slipped and done that once, if I've ever done that, but I don't think I've ever mocked anybody for coming on my show. Especially the bravery that it takes to come on my show and tell these stories, I cannot see myself being like, "Well, first of all, you believe in a space god" or whatever. Like, I would never do that. I would come up with a far better joke than that, but I still wouldn't do that, like live on air or off the air.

At the same time, just so we're not confused about it, I don't want someone coming on my show and being like, "Oh, well, praise be to God because we all know that God is the reason..." Once someone starts doing that, I might be a little bit prone to be like, "All right, all right, let's move on." Because it's a give and take. You're there to tell your story about how you were excommunicated and had the abuse and the things that happened to you because you left. I don't want to insult you [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4497s) insulting religion or criticizing religion. At the same time, I don't want to be left off track or thrown off track by praising Jesus four or five, six times. That happened once, I don't remember who it was, and I was like, at the end, by the end, I was like, "All right, all right." Yeah, it's okay. Like, so believe in anything they want to believe in, but we're there to talk about the cult and the excommunication and the abuse. And so I hope that doesn't deter the people that I just convinced to come on the show. But it's just like, it's not about religion [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4527s) all for me. It's about the weaponization of a certain type of sect and how I think it's the worst thing ever when you see people like Dennis Wragge and Carman and people that I know are believers, and how they had their faith weaponized, and both of you as well when you were still in, weaponized against them and their own well-being. That is what I find really, really heinous.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4555s)

Because it's so offensive.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4555s)

It's so offensive because, and look, I've softened on religion in the last few years. I've told the story a million times, but I guess this is the first time on your podcast. But it stuck with me when Kobe Bryant and his daughter died in a helicopter accident. I remember because I have a daughter who, I think she was five at the time that this happened. And I was like, trying to imagine what Kobe Bryant was thinking and feeling and doing as the helicopter was about to crash and he had his [daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4585s) in his arms or whatever the case may be.

And then I started thinking, like, you know, because I like to torture myself, "What would I do if I survived something like that and my daughter didn't?" And the very first thing that came to mind was how envious I am of people of faith when they're grieving. And I'm not even being close to sarcastic about that whatsoever. I am 100% purely envious and jealous of not having the ability to, in a [dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4615s) moment like that, turn to something that would make me feel better, even just for a moment. You know, "My daughter's in a better place." I would pay and kill in order to have that feeling if I was stuck in a situation that dark and horrendous.

So I don't have a problem with people and their faith. I guess I have a big problem with when people, like leaders of these cults and the PBCC and Bruce Hales and whoever, when they weaponize that belief in God for financial gain, you know, and to reconcile [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4651s) they abuse and oppress women and children. That's where, you know, when faith gets weaponized against you like that, that's, I have a big problem with that. But I have no problem with people of faith, I really don't, you know, just as long as it doesn't hurt other people, I'm fine with it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4667s)

Thank you so much, James. We so appreciate, there's so many people behind me and behind Richard, behind Carman, behind Lane, that are very grateful for you.

### [**James DiFiore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4681s)

Well, I'm also grateful. That feeling is mutual. So thank you guys.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfO5AbltH8&t=4684s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
