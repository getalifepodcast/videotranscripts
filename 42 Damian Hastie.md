## Summary

Damian Hastie's investigations in to the PBCC have already been published in The Times - probably the most famous newspaper in the world.  Here he gives a summary of the results to date of his comprehensive review of Brethren business and family wealth in the UK.  Here on Get A Life we have repeatedly said that the brethren collect far, far more money than they could possibly spend on their schools - but we never had any hard numbers to back up this assertion - until now!  Damian gives us a mind blowing account of just how much money the wealthiest families in the brethren are making, and just how little of that wealth it would take to run the entire OneSchool system.  The burning question is - where does all the money go?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode of Get A Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. Our guest today is Damian Hastie, who's an investigator from Scotland, who has been taking a very, very deep look into the exclusive Brethren, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and in particular their finances.

So with that, Damian, I'll let you introduce yourself to the audience and tell us how you got into this particularly interesting and murky area of investigation.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=56s)

Yeah, obviously, a little bit about my background. I didn't do much investigative work. There's always a career thing that I wanted to go into. But up to the start of COVID, it wasn't something I was really into. I'd never heard of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church at that point.

And it all started really back in July, probably May, June 2020\.

I was still working but the lockdown meant that we were quieter than normal which gave me a bit of time really, to start doing it as a hobby, something to do in the house, I was looking at the contracts released by the UK government. And this is how I stumbled onto the Brethren.

It was a couple of contracts that I'd looked at. I was working with a couple of other researchers, investigators at the time, and we were looking into contracts just generally to see where they'd gone, who got them, was there any links to government, and were they transparent, especially seeing the contracts were awarded in the UK without competition. So we started that, I started that, and then obviously I was working with a couple of others, probably towards the end of May, beginning of June as the contracts came out. And actually the Brethren appeared very quickly. So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=152s) remember the first contract that I found was for Medco Solutions. And just curious looking at the background of the company that had just been set up. It didn't exist until the end of March 2020, no history. So obviously you look at the directors to see their background and that's when I first saw links to the church basically, to the Brethren.

And even then I did think it was a little bit odd, but I didn't really read too much into it. Until the very next day I stumbled across the second one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=192s)

So those links were that they were directors of the church or church meeting halls? What was the clue that gave it away?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=201s)

So the original clue was on Medco. One of the directors was also a director of a company called Zest Trading UK.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=214s)

Right, yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=215s)

Zest Trading UK is actually, obviously now I fully understand the Brethren, is the trading company for, they say it's Campus & Co.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=226s)

Right, okay.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=227s)

A fundraiser for OneSchool Global, and I noticed that one of the directors had been there. When you looked at the other directors, very quickly you could see the links to the church. Yes. That was the first one. And then the very next day, the second contract that I stumbled across actually linked to the Rapid Relief Team.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=249s)

Yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=250s)

And then quick check of the Rapid Relief Team. And it was a Brethren. And to be fair, then I went searching, I went back through all the contracts I'd reviewed and very quickly got up to 13\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=263s)

Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=264s)

Which was highly unusual, I would say, just based on the numbers of revenue, the number of companies that got added to the fact, a lot of people said, well, yeah, but they're dealing safety, workwear and PPE. But these companies didn't.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=283s)

No, no.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=284s)

So yeah and then from there really, um, I work with a guy Peter Jukes from Byline Times, yeah, and one of their journalists. So the first article that came out was in the Byline Times and that was mid towards the end of July 2020\. That was the first press story on it. And pretty much any PPE story, a COVID contract that's been related to the Brethren ever since, I've had [influence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=314s)

That's been in the Sunday Times or the Times and even in Canada I spoke to Press Progress.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=325s)

Yes, yes, they're good.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=327s)

Yeah. So that's how it all came about. And then I think from there, just trying to understand what the link to government was. And I think as each day passed and more companies were found, then began to try and paint a picture of what the Brethren were about.

And to me, just generally over the time since then, talking to ex-members like you guys, it very quickly became apparent that this is a commercial structure. This doesn't feel like a church at all. It feels like a business.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=370s)

Yeah, the church is just a thin layer of paint on the outside. Yeah.

So what kind of personally motivates you in this? Because unlike us, you don't have any back history with the church. I kind of, reading between the lines of what you publish, this, you regard yourself as a kind of an anti-corruption whistleblower. Is that where you're coming from with this?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=396s)

It is, yeah. I think there's probably two or three things. I think the first one is just generally my research is all based around lifting the lid on corruption.

And I'm not saying that they are corrupt but obviously everything I look at is, that's why I'm looking, to see. I'm looking to see if there's links to government, is there lack in the conflicts of interests and whether that be Brethren or non-Brethren, I still look. I still do a little bit of research that isn't Brethren related. And then I think from there it did grow into more so for the Brethren. 

To me that I [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=443s) looking at everything, I still can't understand how they kept their charitable status. Yes, it's back up. What picture was painted to politicians is to me feels wrong. And then just common decency says that actually whether this religion is a right, is a correct religion and but boy, actually, the way [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=473s) treating their ex-members and the way they treat their people inside, that started to drive me as well. So it wasn't just about it being corrupt. It was about a level of fairness and how they treat people. And that hypocrisy is off the charts.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=491s)

Staggering. Of course, there's an interesting, the other aspect that I find for some reason really upsets me is that the members in there are being exploited commercially. You know, even, you know, even the ones that genuinely believe in the system, they're trapped in this system where every single, every dollar they spend, every pound they spend, the church is trying to capture it. And [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=521s) down to Campus & Co, I mean, if you look at the Brethren as, if you look at the Brethren leadership, the church, we say, as a business, and you look at the Brethren members as their customer base, they come in within an ace of capturing every dollar that those people spend. Um, they, you know, it started off with, well we'll give you phones and fax machines and you can pay exorbitant rates for it and then they've gone into insurance and medical health care and [vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=552s) and now it's the supermarket so you know, even your toilet roll is taxed. Um, I mean that's extraordinary, isn't it? I mean, is there any other organization, religious organization that captures the revenue stream of its members in that way?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=569s)

I've not come across any and I do look at other religions as part of some of the sects as I look at my research.

What strikes me very much with the Brethren is that there is, obviously in the 60s was it, the “system” was the Hales were thrown out for trying to bring the system in.

And really all they've added on the front of it is “eco”.

There's a little bit of me, understand that if you were trying to distance yourself from the world and be just within your community, I kind of get why you were trying to set up a system that keeps everything within. But the levels of wealth for circa, when I've done my research and investigations into the UK, you're looking at probably 100 families, extended [families,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=638s) fathers, sons, so maybe 300 families, 400 families in total. I think have all the wealth.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=646s)

Yes, exactly. I mean, if it was like a semi-communist or extreme socialist system where the wealth was distributed and it was like they were operating co-ops of which they're all shareholders, that would be at least equitable in some sense but it's not like that. It's the rich preying on the poor. And I mean it makes me laugh when they talk about ecosystem because anytime you have an ecosystem, guess what's at the top of it? A bunch of a small number of very fat [predators.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=677s) Um, and you know, my message to Brethren in there who have big mortgages and will be constantly pestered to sign up to this or that initiative is, you know, the money is flowing in the wrong direction. 

I mean, I genuinely believed, I genuinely hoped, um, when I saw the Brethren winning those huge contracts and obviously making billions, I hope that at least some, some small proportion of that [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=707s) be pushed back downstream to the grassroots Brethren who actually made it all possible. But there's no evidence that that's happening at all. It's all just staying up at the top. And the kind of the first thing they do after winning these contracts is come out and beg for more money from the rank and file at the bottom.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=728s)

Well, the one bit I don't understand is around the global amount needed each year to run, in reality, the schools. That's the cost, more than anything else, it's the education system. Yet there is enough wealth in that church now to easily run that church. Where Bruce Hales is looking to raise [half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=759s) a billion dollars, yes, and the returns of that would, uh, basically run the whole of the cost for the Brethren. I can't see why they can't do that now. Yes, it, there is wealth. I've done some research recently that looked at pretty much every company I could find in the UK. I have better links. So you're looking at 1,500 live companies, probably over 150 that are sat dormant and in there the wealth was, it was just their assets alone were worth over two billion pounds. So what's 3.4 billion Canadian or Australian dollars, just in assets. Yeah. And you look at that and think, well, surely if you've got just that in assets in your businesses, just in the UK, without looking in Canada, [Australia,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=831s) New Zealand, or the US, you must have the money to actually easily run this each year. But the wealth seems to be all at one end. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=843s)

Yeah. Yeah. 

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=847s)

Yeah. I mean, one of the reasons that they put forward to needing money for the schools is the whole reason for getting money out of everyone. That's the excuse. I came out three years ago, and that's constantly put forward as to why you buy your groceries from the school. And there's a whole, in UBT, there's a whole division called the Global Household Division and that's a team of people. Um, my brother-in-law was the global manager who got them the [Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=877s) Rover for a business car, um, plus he would have been on a three-figure, on a six-figure, um, salary and he was the global manager for a household division. They come up with ideas like “Great Men videos” where they would, where you'd pay, I think it was four or five hundred New Zealand dollars for a set of videos about the “Great Men”, which every household was obligated to buy. [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=907s) was this canvas of the seven great men, which every household was obligated to buy, even if you're on the bread line. And all these things just to get money out of everyone and the reason was the school needs the money. So that whole school needs the money thing is just trotted off the whole time.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=931s)

I, one of the things I do find strange is just, and obviously a lot of my research has been UK based. In the UK, to run the schools, to run OneSchool Global costs them approximately 40 million a year, 40 million UK.

Campus and Co in the UK alone raises 5 million of that, just in the supermarkets. Then you look at the Grace Trust, which is the main charity in the UK, or was the main charity in the UK, that takes its money from UBT. There's another 15 million straight away there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=975s)

So let's say that again. How many million?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=977s)

15 million.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=978s)

Yeah. So that's 20\. Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=981s)

Yeah. So you're at 20 million straight away just from Campus and just from UBT. So without touching any of the families, other than their businesses.

With all the wealth that's floating around, I don't understand why they can't find another 20 million. I think the charitable status alone, the halls is worth 30 to 37 million in UK terms. So I struggle with the numbers when I look at the wealth, the top 80 families in the UK on business, the top 80 businesses in the UK all [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1024s) assets more than four billion.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1029s)

Wow.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1030s)

Plus they pay school fees anyway, so they get a big income just by directly invoicing the parents. Yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1038s)

The numbers don't stack up. And obviously in Australia, they get grants towards the cost of the schools as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1048s)

Substantial, yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1050s)

So when you start looking at it, you think, where's the money going?

Where is it going? If you're inside the Brethren now and you're watching this and you're not sat in a four million pound house with a swimming pool, then you're not in the elite of the Brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1072s)

Not to mention the vehicles, yes, yeah, yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1079s)

The whole structure of how it works, it, to me, I keep looking at the numbers and thinking, well, where's the money going?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1089s)

One thing I'm really looking forward to is, you know, you've been working incredibly hard on adding up the rich list and all the finances and you're starting to go more global.

Now, I realise, I know it's harder to actually dig into these things outside of the UK. One thing that is to the, you know, UK government's credit is that it's easy to find the beneficial owners of all these things so give them one, one brownie point for that. Um, a lot harder in Australia at the moment, but once we've got a good, a substantial proportion of that data, we can extrapolate. We know how many [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1131s) there are. Um, they're very, very consistent around the globe. I mean, yeah, the ones in Argentina are not going to be making so much, but mostly they, the vast majority of them live in wealthy Commonwealth democracies plus USA. So we're, or you, I should say, give you the credit, you're going to have a pretty accurate number for how much money they raise globally. And the other number that's not hard to obtain is the cost of schooling [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1162s) child from, you know, infant food to high school. These are all government figures. We know how much that costs. And then we're going to actually put the numbers together and you know, instead of saying where's the money going, we're going to say where is the 2.73 billion or whatever the difference is, where is that going? Um, is that something you anticipate reaching sometime?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1188s)

I do. And one, probably one number I didn't give out is, or I've not mentioned yet, is the top 80 companies in the UK. So this is after tax. So when them companies have all paid their tax, the 80 companies in the last, if you look at their last financial year, most of that is 2021 that's been logged, made 250 million pounds. So you're looking in terms of 1.7 for Canada and 1.8 for Australia.

That's just profit. Yeah.

Wow. It doesn't take any wages. It doesn't take anything else into consideration. That's left over. It's profit in 80 companies.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1245s)

So just to sum up what you're saying, in the UK, the schooling is costing approximately 40 million a year. Half of that is paid by Campus & Co plus the Grace Trust. So that leaves you 20 million. Plus then they're charging school fees of around $1,000 a pupil, which must add up to a few more million. So let's say they've got a deficit of about, let's say, generously [17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1275s) million to make up.

Those wealthiest Brethren companies after tax, after they've paid all the wage, have got 250 million to play with. So they could reduce that to, you know, 246 million and they would still be able to afford, you know, fish and chips at the shop around the corner and probably a bicycle to go collect it, wouldn't they?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1306s)

Then that's why I said the numbers don't stack up.

The more you look at it the, where, where is the real wealth going? Um, and the other pressures, one of the things that I, irks me a little bit, uh, has not been forever, but coming and looking and investigating is the reason I was talking to somebody who left within the last 12 months. They were saying that as a young Brethren member, 20 year old, you're looking to get married, they have to purchase their first house and it's expected they will spend in UK terms 600,000 to 700,000 on that property, which is over a million in Canadian and Australian dollars.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1371s)

Yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1372s)

Yeah, that very first property. It's all, to me, done to keep that coercive control. The control that that person has got a job in the Brethren, they've got a mortgage. How do they leave? How do they walk away from that? It becomes almost impossible to leave. Yeah, you leave with nothing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1397s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1398s)

That really continues right through your life. Even, you know, as you get older and your children get older, you get a bigger house and you know, you even get to my age, you might still have a big mortgage and you've got no qualifications and you're all tied up financially and you can't leave.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1419s)

Yeah, and it even continues after you're dead because what we're increasingly finding is that older Brethren are being pressurized and coercively controlled for leaving all their money to the church in their will. Um, it's a, it's a shocking, it's a shocking system. I mean, what you're saying about the houses is also something you wouldn't have been so aware of is the intense pressure there is inside the Brethren for young men to get married.

Not not so much for [young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1449s) sisters, but I mean, when I got to 20, you know, in the locality of Cambridge where I was, there was extreme pressure to get married. It was like publicly said in the meetings, sort of young bachelors who had got up to sort of 25 and weren't married were publicly called out in church for, you know, not getting on with it. And of course, I realized why that is now, I didn't realize at the time. It's because once you're married, you're trapped. I mean, a lot of people who [leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1479s), they take advantage of that little space in time when you're kind of old enough to be independent but you're not married to to get out the system. And they want to minimize that because not because they're concerned about your soul, it's because they're losing customers.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1496s)

It's everything seems to revolve around money and a lot of money. Wealth that, if you average that wealth out across the Brethren worldwide, there should not be a poor person in the Brethren. No.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1516s)

Yeah, but the fact is that there are poor people in the Brethren. There are people that struggle.

And there's a lot of people that have no idea. Um, and actually Bruce Hales put out a sheet a few years ago for young brothers, um, about how to save for a house and it was laughable really. Um, he said they should buy their first house by a certain age, um, they should that it should be four bedrooms and they should do this and should do that. And I looked at it with my family and it was just a joke. Um, there was no way that anyone could do that, um, because of the wages that we were getting in New Zealand. Um.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1564s)

What I've heard recently is that wages are inflated at the time they're purchasing the property.

So just before purchasing, you say, I, I've been told by somebody that's left fairly recently that wages are actually inflated by whichever brother owns the business while they purchase the property, which he would, obviously without proof, but it is hearsay. Yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1593s)

Wages are put up like where a young brother actually comes to get married, the wages are put up so he can purchase property. That's, that's often done, yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1606s)

And then the, the other thing that I've followed, obviously there's some things that I don't put on the website that I do because obviously there is a real Brethren at the top willing to take people to court. So unless it's factual, I will not put it on paper. I'll not put it on print. And one of the things that I have done is look at some of the, you can track some of the wealthiest Brethren's own personal property moves over the years. So I was looking at one family in the Reading area in the UK [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1656s) a particular wealthy family and one with close ties to the Hales, I may add. Um, he purchased, so this brother would have purchased his first property around the age of 23 for 1.3 million pounds.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1677s)

Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1678s)

He then moved to another property, yeah, 2.1 million just before his 30th birthday.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1684s)

So what was that number again?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1687s)

2.1.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1688s)

2.1, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then, and then, since then, since obviously all the Tory contracts, which I believe has bought a property close to 4 million pounds.

That's quite the palace. This person is not 40 years old yet.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1707s)

Yep.

Wow. And even after that, they've still got plenty of change. I mean, they really do have the problem of having more money than they know what to do with, which makes it all the more kind of egregious that they still constantly pestering the grassroots members of the flock for more cash. They go around cap in hand like shameless street beggars, you know, with this four million dollar mansion in the [background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1738s) I mean, that's what upsets me because, you know, I know a lot of people in there and I know a lot of people who work incredibly long hours and struggle to make ends meet. And they're subjected to this barrage of raw commercial propaganda, which is all tied in. You know, it's not saying buy this because it's wonderful and it'll be good for you. It's saying buy this because we desperately need the money to help our schools. And it's all a lie.

It really is shocking. I mean, you run out of, you run out of expletives and adjectives.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1778s)

The same thing that used to annoy me, Richard, is when Bruce Hales came to the country.

And the brothers who got given the job to organise the travel arrangements were the wealthy brothers at the top. And they didn't give a toss what it cost. And all these families would be expected to take the whole family to the meetings. And they'd be presented with a bill for $600 per head. Wow. And they just expected to pay it. And then you get some brother saying, well, look, if you just put $50 aside every week, [you'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1815s) be able to afford to go there. It's simple, isn't it? Some families couldn't put $50 aside every week. They couldn't put $2 aside every week. Well, exactly. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1825s)

If you put $100,000 aside every week, you'll get to a million quite quickly. Well, what's the problem? I don't understand. Yeah. So that was in the sense that they had arranged airline travel and so on, that was way in excess of what you could have got by going the cheapest carrier. Is that the kind of situation?

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1846s)

Yeah, well, it was the rich guys organising it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's just what you're saying. It's just mindless, the rich and the poor and the mindless things that go on in there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1861s)

I mean, when I was in the Brethren in Canada, you used to have to arrange the travel through Hughes Travel Trust, which was a Brethren company, and this has been superseded now. And yeah, the price you'd pay for a ticket was like twice what you'd get if you went to a travel agent. And so people would try and arrange their own travel independently, and they'd get the wrist slapped and say, no, you must book through Hughes Travel. And they'd say, well, it's much cheaper just to drive or take a train or [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1891s) a cheap flight. And the answer was, oh, yes, but we use the surplus to subsidize Brethren traveling from Argentina or something. Now, whether that was true or not, I kind of suspect it all ended up where all the rest of it ends up. But that's the kind of crap that goes on, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1908s)

Yeah, well we had a young brother recently that alleged when he was getting to the age where he was going to be buying a house, they started coming to him and saying, let us keep a certain percentage of your paycheck and we'll hold it for you, we'll save it for you. Yeah, which takes away his choice, uh, whether to stay or whether to leave because they're holding on to part of your paycheck.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1933s)

Yeah, I mean sooner or later if they haven't already, they're going to set up their own bank. I mean in effect they've kind of got that already but that's got to be the next thing on the agenda.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1945s)

Oh they've been talking about that, yeah they have been talking about it. Like when I was in there they were talking about their own bank.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1954s)

I find it interesting in the UK, obviously the Grace Trust, which was the major charity that everything UBT fell under, OneSchool Global was funded from the Grace Trust, Rapid Relief Team's funded from the Grace Trust. UBT has moved under a company UBT Holdings and is no longer directly into the Grace Trust and that's run by [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=1984s) couple of others.

But interestingly on there is that they've moved into having a private equity sort of bank in the background basically. It's funny Richard, before when you talked on the transparency in the UK, the next bank was based in Jersey, which then the transparency disappears. And I suspect that some of this, UBT money is now disappearing offshore and the ability to track it will become more and more difficult.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2018s)

It's very interesting I saw that and I know that John Hales and Bruce Hales had spoken very strongly in their ministry about not using offshore financing arrangements which they described as unrighteous. So I was very amused to see Jersey, which for people whose geography is not up to date, is a semi-independent island somewhere in the English Channel that is notorious for hosting dodgy banking institutions.

I'm tempted to think of some pun about pulling the wool over their eyes, but it's not coming to me yet.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2058s)

It's also interesting the private equity getting involved as well. Because I can, it's clear that they've created the Vision fund to invest in some of their own businesses.

See quite clearly in the way in the UK have that structured. So basically what you've got is the Vision fund very much like, basically private equity would be…

For people that don't understand private equity. If I'm running a business and I need a cash injection into that business to really grow that business. And when I say cash injection, that might be 20 million pounds, 20 million dollars [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2107s) into that business, basically the private equity take a share of that business and they invest the money in there. And quite often with private equity, what they do is they put their own directors in there to obviously make sure that the business is growing.

The Vision fund are doing very similar. So I can see in the UK that you've got two or three brothers that are when the Vision fund invests in a business suddenly become directors of that business as well. So a couple examples, Kingsway Global where you've got Tim Drake coming in as a director of that business and then also Moroak, again Tim Drake was appointed to that and one of the Freeman family. So you can see these people, it's almost like they're using a private equity model.

But what's interesting is that there is still two or three businesses within the UK that have suddenly been allowed to take proper private equity.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2175s)

Yes, yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2178s)

So basically, if you look at them businesses, it doesn't look now like they are on paper Brethren own businesses. So an example would be what was the Turner's of Southgate business in North Norfolk. That business, if you go on to the UK's company's house, it's got a whole list of directors, none of them are Brethren brothers. That business, once you dig down into the shareholding of that business through a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2209s) convoluted and quite complex structure, when you get to who owns that business, that is still owned by the Turner family and they are still working in that business.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2221s)

Wow, so apart from anything else that helps them to evade people like you who are just browsing through Companies House to see who owns what so they can own a business and it doesn't look as if they do. I suppose you, I mean how hard is it to get down to that layer where you actually find the Brethren? Is it all in public data?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2243s)

Yeah it is, it's not particularly difficult but it's following that chain. So usually you're looking for who the major shareholder is and generally what you will see is you've got one company and then that's got a parent company and that's got a parent company and that's got a parent company and you follow all the chains linked in the chain and by the time you get to the end you come to what was the original company quite often.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2275s)

Yes, yes. Yes, I mean, I did some digging into Australian businesses, Brethren businesses, I mean, particularly in connection with what's now called Inivos. You try and dig out there, you know, the actual beneficial owners in Australia. And when I first started publishing about that particular group of people, suddenly a whole load of things disappeared.

Addresses on websites were changed, names of this and that were changed to conceal the Hales connection. You know, suddenly their office wasn't in Sydney, it was in Perth, the other side of the country. And then when you dig into the shareholding, they're all owned by family trusts, an anonymous family trust. But when you track back the family trust you find the family trust was originally named the something and something Hales trust, but you know they've got this weird legal structure whereby a family trust can own or trust can own something and and there's no publicly available data on who owns the trust, which I think is changing. 

Um, there are proposals to change that but I mean it's a haven for fraudulent schemes if that's how it works. And I kind of suspect that they get the money out of the UK as fast as they can because it's just too easy to see there. And once it's actually got to Australia, it vanishes like a stone dropped in the ocean [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2369s) it's all opaque there.

The big question in my mind, and I suspect in yours, is how do they get the money from the UK to Australia? Because I think we have a pretty shrewd idea. That's where a lot of it actually ends up.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2385s)

Yeah. Obviously, there's quite a few companies now that... and UBT is a great example. UBT obviously being a global business, you do wonder if... and there are all the businesses that might have different names in Australia and a different name in the UK. Some have got the same name across three or four countries. But there is a lot more global companies. And I found it really interesting if you looked at the COVID contracts that were awarded to the Brethren, actually, it really summed up the Brethren for me to what actually happens. Circa 85-90% of all the COVID contracts had direct links to the Hales.

Then the crux went everywhere else. Yeah. And then when you obviously initially the big winner was Unispace.

So Unispace was Gareth and Charles Hales's company.

The UK arm of it reported was a subsidiary of the Australian business. So actually everything that was in that business in the UK went back to Australia. And working with Private Eye, a couple of the journalists at Private Eye, what we could see was when it transferred over to Sante Global, which once Gareth and Charles had sold the [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2483s) Unispace business, they moved everything and the contract over to the Sante Global. What you could see with Sante Global was what they reported in the UK was really, obviously they'd made, I'm trying to remember, it's the top of my head, it was something like 80 million profit.

When you went to Australia and some Australian journalists had done some work on Sante Global or it reached a threshold where they have to report in Australia, then it suddenly doubled.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2515s)

Yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2517s)

Actually thinking, well, if all the contracts were in the UK, how come in Australia the profit was so different?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2526s)

Yes, yes. Well, I mean, this reminds me of the Starbucks scheme, which is that Starbucks weren't paying any tax in the UK, and the reason is they weren't making any profit. The reason they weren't making any profit is the coffee and sugar they bought from the parent company was sold to them at extremely exaggerated margins so that it just kind of balanced out the profit they made. So technically they were running at a wash in the UK but it [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2556s) the practical effect of transferring all the profits offshore into a lower tax regime. And I imagine any time you've got an international company with branches and subsidiaries in different countries, it's very easy to make the profits appear in the country where you want them to appear. And it would take some pretty good forensic accounting to, and I mean, to some extent it is legal to, you know, for internal trading, it is legal to some degree to manipulate the [price,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2587s) isn't it?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2588s)

I generally believe that a lot of what is done is legal. I've come out of evidence that says it isn't legal.

I'm not asking for a church if it's moral.

A real, we will use, it's not tax avoidance but it's tax reduction. Yes, a lot of the UK companies have R\&D and what's called a patent box and that reduces your your tax, tax bill at the end of the year. Amazing how many companies have actually got that in place.

It's like every single, they don't miss a trick is what it means.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2638s)

No, no. Let's not forget that this is Bruce Hales, this is how he started off.

His career was tax with his father. They were saving tax for people and big companies, they were, they were looking after the attacks and he knows all sorts of loopholes and he'll be doing everything he can to do this sort of thing.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2671s)

It's the fact that it's very rare you come across a company, I think I came across one actually the last two or three weeks where I looked at their accounts and thought they're missing all the loopholes, they're not using this, they're not using that. Yeah.

Which is really unusual.

And you do question their loyalty then to deliver everyone when they're not following all the...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2699s)

They're too honest to be a loyal brother.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2706s)

Just to go back to what you were saying before Damien about the Brethren being common shareholders with, with the outside, what we call worldly people, that that is, I'd like to do a bit of a shareholder rant here, I know I can't, but that is a, that that's what the Brethren call, call it a compromise. And you know, going back just a few short years, that was a major, a major, major thing. There's absolutely no way that you could, you could be a common shareholder with an outside person, diversely yoked with unbelievers. They're trying to hide it, they're obviously trying to, trying to hide it in one sense, um, but in another sense, they're not trying to hide it as well. And it's just excuse now. Sorry, go on Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2757s)

No, diversely yoked with unbelievers was their scripture, wasn't it? That's right, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2762s)

Yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2764s)

And now it seems that they're just not ashamed of it. Yeah. And it's just, it's just absolutely incredible that they would go to that that low if you like. Yeah. And um, in 1959 there was a major split in the church with directorships where people had to leave their jobs. There was a big thing in the UK and Scotland where a lot of people had to give up their directorships of companies and families were split over it and that sort of thing. Yeah, hundreds of families. And here they are doing this today.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2800s)

Yeah.

It's not that there's anything wrong with it. It's the hypocrisy that they have wrecked hundreds and hundreds of lives over the past 70 years on this very issue. And then without even a blush, they suddenly turn around it. And as long as you're in the elite, you can go do it. I mean, that applies to a whole string of things, of course.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2825s)

It's interesting, Richard, you touched on it before around how things suddenly were moved off websites and names changed, addresses changed.

That's a common occurrence in the UK. So particularly I've looked into some, uh, Medco Solutions is a great example. Their website changed about four or five times, different addresses each time. You could link an address to something and you published it on Twitter, the next minute that address would change. LinkedIn profiles being deleted and new ones being created and work being removed. So which for me [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2867s) an investigator always makes me think, what are they hiding? Yes, it's a giveaway, isn't it? Changing things. Why is it, why?

One of the things I picked up on that was one of the medical directors was also a director in, um, a shareholder in a very small part of Sante Global. At Sante Global when Unispace was sold, but he worked for Unispace up until the pandemic. I'm absolutely convinced that that business, Medco Solutions, to give you some background, is the biggest COVID winner of the Brethren businesses worldwide. So they won just shy of a £1 billion worth of contracts, so 1.7 billion in Canadian, 1.8 in Australian dollars. And that business did not exist prior to the [pandemic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=2932s)

The directors, the two brothers, one worked for Gareth and Charles Hales at something or Unispace as it was at the time, but he went into his LinkedIn profile and took that away. The other interesting thing there is when you actually go and look at that is that Medco Solutions PTY Limited in Sydney, Australia is owned by Dean Hales.

So, so you look at that and you think, well, he owns Medco Solutions PTY. He also owned Medco Solutions Inc in the US.

But he didn't own it in the UK. However, there is a, in the Medco Solutions UK version of their accounts, there is still 48 million waiting to, went to a third party. And we're still waiting for this third party to release their account.

So when you start looking at it, you just think they're trying to hide things. And in reality, it felt like all the businesses that won saw that the big money wasn't actually, other than Unispace with the PPE, the really big money was in the COVID tests or the RATs, the rapid antigen testing. That's where the real big money went. And that went to the Hales. In New Zealand, just recently discovered that they supplied 30, the New Zealand government [bought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3033s) 120 million RATs, 38 million were supplied by a company called CoShield Global. Yes, CoShield is, CoShield is one of the, New Zealand is very good. It's quite open in the transparency of who owns the companies. So CoShield is predominantly owned by UBT.

So it's owned by Caleb Hall, Chief Exec. Global for UBT. It's owned by UBT. It's owned by Dean Hales.

So that's New Zealand. In Australia, there was two contracts, one by a company, Westlab, one by 2San. 2San is another business owned by Dean Hales. The contracts in the UK were owned by Medco Solutions, where we don't know where the money's gone yet. And the other one was a company Sterilabs.

Sterilabs actually when you read the contract it was a joint, a joint effort with Sante Global and by the way Westlab in Australia it was a joint effort with Sante Global and Sante Global is owned by Gareth and Charles Hales.

So when you start looking at everything, there's always a Hales.

Anything that is big and financial with the Brethren. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3120s)

It's almost like a kind of a status thing. I mean, I imagine if you were in the Brethren and you actually exceeded the wealth of one of the Hales companies, you would be in a very, very dangerous place. They don't like anyone to get ahead of them. They always have to have the biggest chunk of everything that's going.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3140s)

It's interesting you say that, Richard. When I looked in the UK, it felt like you were not allowed to let your business turn over more than 50 million.

And your assets really can't go past 25 million.

Obviously because of the pandemic, there's a couple of companies that have pushed them levels.

And interestingly, one of them had a non-executive director brought in from within the Brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3177s)

Oh, I've met them. I've met them. I mean, that's what happened to my family business that my father set up. It was going well. And they brought in a non-executive director, all done very subtly but with a push from Dean Hales. The non-executive director introduced a friend of his as a general manager and at that time it was, you know, they were just, my father had three sons but one of them had passed so it was just myself [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3207s) my brother. I was the junior and I wasn't into management anyway but I was perceived as a threat to this general manager's position because in practice, you know, I tended to make the decisions in consultation with my older brother who was the manager. And so after a year or so, suddenly there was this massive kind of constructive dismissal exercise, which successfully ejected me out of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3237s) business.

And I kind of thought, well, I know where this is going. In course of time, we're going to find that that non-executive director and the general manager actually become full directors of the business. And sure enough, three years after I left, I mean, I only looked this up a couple of weeks ago, sure enough, looked up the, looked up the company and those two people are now full directors of the business. So that's, that's what their non-executive directors are about.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3269s)

Yeah, I definitely, I think there is this, an element there that a business isn't allowed to grow too big. They're not bigger than the Hales businesses. But I also think there's some businesses that the ownership is opaque, as you say, in Australia.

And some of these businesses may well be owned by the Hales anyway.

I mean, there's a couple of things that have always intrigued me throughout this is how and where the contacts are, how, how did they win all these gold contracts?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3306s)

Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3306s)

I think I know, I can't say.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3309s)

I think we all know pretty much.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3313s)

Everybody, um, yeah, and it does link, it is an Australian UK link within, uh, um, at government level, uh, is all I would say that that's what. And I've talked to many, many people in, people that work to Brethren companies, suppliers to Brethren companies, suppliers of PPE to Brethren companies, people that have introduced Brethren [companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3344s) to Chinese companies. So when you start getting all this information together, currently working on probably the biggest piece that I've done, LinkedIn with a couple of others to really get it over the line. And I hope to get that out and published in the next couple of weeks.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3364s)

Wow.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3364s)

In something that is pretty amazing, really, when I look at it, how a business has, to me, managed to cover its tracks of when there's been anything controversial. And it feels almost as if somebody's helped them cover the tracks right the way through to how they won a COVID contract, a substantial, so I'm talking, I'm talking a, [looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3395s) at the eight figure number contract and now probably have all the pieces.

And it is a fascinating story that goes back over 10 years and looks at that company.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3411s)

Wow.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3412s)

And, and what it, it's, it's been a strange experience probably the last three weeks because I started on the rich list and I got into part four and part four is this is the piece and it, it just goes on and on and on and goes arms and likes to accompany the tech of the European Commission to call.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3438s)

I'm not going to say anything but I can probably hazard a guess.

We should probably make it clear here that all the data you have is securely backed up elsewhere and so even if they do decide to accidentally run you over with a bus in the next few days we will make sure it all gets out.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3457s)

So it's all sat with The Times as well. So I can say that quite well, the whole story.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3465s)

Yeah, if I was your wife, I'd be insuring you for a high value.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3473s)

Yeah, it's probably the most, it probably brings everything together. At the moment, it's just trying to get all the t's crossed and the i's dotted on every information that we've got.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3490s)

I think when they see it, their eyes are going to be crossed and their t's are going to be dotted but...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3499s)

There's probably one thing we can be sure of and they, they would have shared a few restaurant meals with a few people I would think, which is also very much forbidden in the Brethren until recently. Right, that is...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3510s)

Uh.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3511s)

Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3513s)

I think it is interesting. I, within this, there is somebody within government that I, I can't prove at the moment but I do wonder if there is a link there, that's all I'll say. Do wonder if there's a link there and I think he still is the only politician that has blocked me.

Yeah, so I do wonder why.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3542s)

Yeah, I guess you'd be following the Good Law Project as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3547s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. They're trying to...

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3550s)

Cover it, they're trying to open up from the other end and aren't getting on too well. I mean, well, I shouldn't say I get on too well, but they're, they're, the government's pushing back very, very hard of course against them.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3562s)

Yeah, so the Good Law Project, I've done work with, uh, Good Law Project. Um, obviously they, they went to print with, um, the Michelle Donnelan, who's a minister of the UK, uh, story. So Michelle is now married and I think they've just had a child, um, to Tom Turner from the Chippenham Brethren. Yeah, um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3592s) what fascinates me on that story is a secondary bet is that their contracts show that they won 4 million in the UK, yet they paid tax on, but their tax would suggest that they turned over that year 30 to 35 million. And that business last year and the year prior turned over about four. So what that would suggest to me is that that business that was linked [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3622s) that time did probably 30 million in PPE, all at the very beginning of the pandemic.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3636s)

So how have they managed to pay so little tax? What do you think the mechanism is there?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3641s)

No, no, I'm based on the tax, but their accounts don't show it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3645s)

Yeah, yes.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3647s)

So in the UK, if a company turns over under 36 million, they don't need to put in a full set of accounts.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3655s)

Right.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3655s)

Yeah, um, I wouldn't be all surprised if that company turned over 35,999,000 because I'm amazed that that the tax would suggest at that level. Um, so you don't get clear picture of every company but where you can usually look out is by the tax that's paid. So corporation tax up until this year in the UK is 19%. So [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3686s) know how they will use every loophole to avoid paying more tax than they have to do. So if you work on the basis of worst case scenario that can only be 19%. If somebody has paid a million pounds in tax, their pre-tax profits must have been close on 5 million.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3710s)

So there's a turnover on that. Yeah, substantial.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3715s)

So for some reason that company particularly didn't want its full accounts to be public?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3721s)

No.

I still find it very strange.

I find it hard to believe that didn't turn over more than 36 million. That was just, what that suggests is that the profit they were making on the PPE would have been circa 25%. It's huge.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3744s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3745s)

And the other interesting bit there, linking to what the Good Law Project did with Michelle Donnelan, I do know that within the Cabinet Office in the UK, there was real anger that that story had been published. Interesting. Very interesting. Working with journalists throughout, sometimes yes, it annoys government when stories come out, but not to the level I heard that had happened with Michelle Donnelan's story.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3772s)

That's very interesting. I mean, how long has the UK government got left? When's the next election got to be by?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3778s)

By the end of next year.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3780s)

Yeah, because I mean, at that time, inevitably, there's going to be a change of government and that's when all the cans of worms explode simultaneously, doesn't it? I mean,

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3792s)

I think some of it will come out. I think some of it won't.

Not being cynical, I think there's some things that just won't come out. I have spoken to a number of MPs that have been non-conservative MPs, that have been MPs in Brethren areas, in wherever communities are, just really to get a flavour, do they get lobbied and then not conservative? To nowhere near the level.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3823s)

No, no, that's what I'd imagine. They're aware of them but not, yeah.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3829s)

It makes me laugh hearing about these Hales’s heavily into the PPE and Covid stuff because then and uh in 2020 I, I wasn't kicked out until August 2020, but we were told in the Brethren that Bruce Hales has said for the Brethren not to rush into doing anything to do with COVID, you know, don't rush [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3859s) supplying PPE and anything related to COVID because it's, it wouldn't be wise.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3871s)

Well, I mean, we know why that was.

That was so as to reserve all the really juicy stuff for his, you know, his favourites. You know, they didn't want competition from grassroots Brethren down there. They wanted to scoop it for themselves.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3887s)

Yeah, he obviously could see that it was a good thing and one of the grassroots brings them to stay away from it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3895s)

Yeah. I mean I must admit it's been my policy for a long time that if there's something that Bruce Hales tells you not to do, obviously there's something good there that you ought to get into.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3909s)

I have heard of a company in New Zealand that did totally ignore what Bruce Hales said. I'm doing a couple of things I maybe shouldn't have done.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3930s)

Well Damien, it does sound like that we're going to have to get you back in a few weeks time because it sounds like you're on the edge of something. I mean, if you're still around in a few weeks time.

**Peter Hart**

That sounds so morbid, Richard. 

**Richard Marsh**

Believe me, I have reasons for what I say.

Actually, in that connection, two of the people, I mean, when, you know, I don't know if everyone knows the story, but the Brethren hired a very dodgy private investigator to hunt me down and allegedly to kidnap me. Certainly, they asked him to steal my computer. Two of the guys who hired him are Rod Diplock and Brad Mitchell. Now, we're talking about CoShield Global. When this private investigator approached me and said, look, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=3980s) need to get out of wherever I was, Ontario, because someone's, you know, they're after you, he gave away the names of his clients, Rod Diplock, Brad Mitchell. So I go online, put those names in, and one of the first things that comes up is they're directors of CoShield Global.

So I put the conversation I'd had with the private investigator online, and lo and behold, suddenly CoShield Global's page for “our management” was offline. It was just an HTTP 404, whatever you get on the screen. But of course, and this is what I'd advise anyone to do, I'd already got it on Wayback Machine. So we have now preserved the whole leadership of CoShield Global that they don't want you to know about. 

[Interestingly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4032s) enough, I also turned up much more recently a video on the UBT accountants website, which was promoting their ability to do these complex transactions whereby you get non-Brethren, what do you call them, investment? What was the term again Damien? The investment, yeah private, private investment, yeah private equity, that's right. There's this video promoting how that the UBTA could manage this complex [stunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4062s) to get non-Brethren private equity in your business and still retain ownership and one of the testimonials was Brad Mitchell and you know, maybe they just put him on because he's got a pretty face but I doubt it. Anyway I published this on the ex-Brethren Facebook page and suddenly that testimonial disappears off UBTA's website but I had fortunately downloaded it. I republished it on YouTube [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4093s) shortly afterwards I got a complaint \-  UBT accountants was hitting me with a copyright strike for putting Brad Mitchell up on YouTube. So I think I've now got it on MSM or something, some other channel. So no doubt they'll be receiving lawyers letters soon. You know, the internet's a big place and they can chase me around as long as they like. I don't mind.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4117s)

When you talk about, obviously, the story in Australia, was it the Daily, daily, daily, something that I in Australia released a couple of stories recently.

And when we worked with the guy, James, it was called when we did the second version. Yeah, I spoke to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4139s)

To bring in the the Westlab bit.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4142s)

Yeah.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4142s)

What was interesting there is Westlab and Sante Global had exactly the same article on their web pages, exactly the same article. It said, it said Westlab and vice versa, but you're talking here a case study of probably 700 words and the only differences were where it said Westlab, Westlab, it said Sante Global and vice versa. As soon as they published a story, both them case [studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4173s) disappeared.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4179s)

Probably they should, they should do a PhD course in slamming the door after the horse has fled, shouldn't they? I mean it's...

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4186s)

To be fair, there's some of the, sometimes I'm doing investigation, you're looking into a company, you're, you're researching lots of different areas, you're doing Google searches, you're going into doubt where you're going into, doing all kinds of things that you're looking at and then the last thing you go to the website and it just tells you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4207s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're kind of clueless.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4209s)

It still amazes me that actually that should always be the first part of call to look at their websites. I can't believe how much information they give out.

It's, it feels like it's, it's a brag.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4224s)

Yes, yeah exactly. And I was going to say that they, to them, their whole, I mean, we were saying this on the previous podcast that to the Brethren, your value is simply your net worth. I mean, I found a little meme that said, what would you be worth if all your money was gone? And to them, that's the beginning and end of it. And they just can't resist. If they've achieved something financially, they have to brag about it. And then they later find that, oh, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4254s) know, there was something dodgy. They knew there was something dodgy but they then when a journalist picks up on it they suddenly panic and try and wipe it out but they can't resist the temptation to brag about it. Um, yeah, to their own detriment, yeah, yeah.

Well Damien, it has been a great fun having you on. Uh, it's been absolutely fascinating and I feel that this is just the, you know, the first nibble at the cake.

And, you know, we really look forward to the next chapters and so on. I just wish we had more time. But is there anything else you want to add on this episode? Your famous last words, as they say?

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4305s)

I think for me, thank you for inviting me on.

It really will be fascinating if this story is all, and we can get it all printed because it's a series of events.

And I think it really does sort of expose how the Brethren work as businesses.

It links into UBT, it links into the Hales, it links into China, it links intoCovid contracts, it links into taking people to court, taking companies to court and budgeting for things that they... I don't think I've ever seen in somebody's account before an accrual of an amount of money that they know they're going to [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4359s) to pay out in court.

Why not pay if they know they're going to have to pay and it hasn't gone to court at that point? I don't get everything. So I've been accruing for, uh, for me not playing fairly. Uh, so yeah, I'm, I think if we can get that whole story out, as I say, working with a number of journalists, the Times do have everything, but they're not the only ones with everything. So if I was to disappear, there [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4394s) definitely somebody to pick up on that. And I think I'd be the final bit of the story then. Yeah, exactly.

So no, I have nothing else other than it's been a real pleasure the three years just, I've spoke to so many people that have been in the Brethren like yourselves and the one common factor that I see is everybody knows that everybody's suffered the loss of somebody in their family and some people, mum and others, where they no longer see that family. Yet every single person I meet [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4435s) I've talked to that affects everyone is a genuinely decent human being who really cares and actually when you asked earlier what spurs me on, that partly is what keeps me going.

Yeah, thank you. It's the ex-Brethren community.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4454s)

Yeah, yeah. We really appreciate that. I mean, we don't have many people on who are not ex-members and it's really, it's really potent actually to get a, so to speak, an outsider's view of what the Brethren really is because the Brethren's standard rebuttal is, oh, well, they're just disaffected former members with an axe to grind. And sure, we do have an axe. I think possibly Carman has a chainsaw or two.

When it comes from someone who's never been part of the community, who stumbled across this by accident, and you get their, you know, unvarnished, researched view of what it's about, that's, that's very, it's very valuable to us in the ex-Brethren community to have that. So, um, thank you very much. Thank you for promoting our podcast on your website as well. Appreciate that a lot and we're really looking forward to the next episode.

### [**Damian Hastie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4514s)

Yes, very looking forward to it. Yeah, thank you.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4519s)

Thank you Damien. There's a lot of grateful ex-Brethren, yeah, yeah, for all that you do. Thank you very much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4527s)

Yeah. Thank you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGmzJM3JNQ&t=4530s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
