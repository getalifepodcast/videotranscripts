## Summary

Nearly all members of the PBCC are born into the community and know no different – unless they leave. However, Dean Wheelers’ parents left the PBCC and he was born outside of it. His father rejoined when Dean was 11 years old and gained custody of his three sons. Dean describes how alien it was to suddenly have to conform to PBCC rules and way of life after having a childhood of freedom. He recounts how doctrine enforced on him resulted in a religious trauma that took him years to work through and the difficulties he had in doing this. We hope you enjoy listening as Dean talks about this unusual perspective on the PBCC.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=53s)

I'm here tonight with Gilli and Ross will be joining us very shortly, and our special guest tonight is Dean Wheeler. Good evening Dean, how are you?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=62s)

Very well, thank you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=63s)

Good. So Dean is, like the rest of us, an ex-member of the PBCC, but Dean has a rather unusual story in that he wasn't born into the PBCC, were you Dean? So maybe you could just start off by telling us your story.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=81s)

I think we need to start in the beginning and I suppose by starting in the beginning I would say that as I first started, if I go back as far as I can in life, I suppose I can remember being a child, a young child and mum, kind of like, I don't know, we were friends with the neighbours and as I got a bit older I could see my dad was brethren orientated and we'd talk about the brethren and worked very hard and my mum was busy leaving him basically. Due to him wanting to go back to the brethren I believe. My dad was 34 I think when she married her aged 19 or 18\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=142s)

Yeah so your parents met and married in the Brethren?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=144s)

They met and married in the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=145s)

And then they left before you were born?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=148s)

They were kicked out and in two minds of whether to leave. My dad, over the years I've spoken like you know, spoke to my mum and she would say to me your dad tried to leave but couldn't and I wanted out there. She told me that you know, she told me that at an early age. Yeah and like you know she had a boyfriend by the time I was like six, seven years old. We were, I was going swimming with her and Bob, who became her [husband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=179s), and my brothers as well you know, and didn't really take much. Like one day my dad and I've had an argument, blah, blah, blah.

Then it became a bit more serious about the divorce, I'm going eight, nine years old now. And my dad, I remember Charles Dunn and Chris Brown coming to my house and giving me a Bible when I was like nine or something, you know, getting this gold leaf thing to look at.

And the marriage was definitely over then, and my dad moved into the attic and he was working full-time you know he would work hard. My mum was out and out and about you know, she's still young crumbs you know. And I suppose around that time, yeah, she had a tv in her room. I'd watch tv on her tv but more than anything I was quite free, quite free. And [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=242s) dad was working up there, my mum was busy, I was out on a bike and I was meeting the kids in the neighbourhood. We were from, dare I say it, not being pretentious, quite a good neighbourhood as well, we weren't in the ghetto here, you know.

We talk about Reigate so you meet the kids and yeah I was, I was very free as as a little kid. I was extremely free. I'm talking about when I look back on my childhood and it's literally full of riding bikes, friends, time. I've worked this a bit.

You know you just came in and you like my dad he was so busy and if he was getting, you know, I mean sometimes I'd come home from being on his knees sort of praying or something like that you know. But so it's pretty chaotic sort of like those years and then it came to a divorce and my mum brought a tiny little 14th century cottage and had it all done up and [Bob's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=316s) divorce was going through, bearing in mind he was a married man as well you know, with young children. They got together and then, but you know as you can think I'm eight or nine now, now we're going on to nine and ten, they're getting divorced. And I remember thinking don't leave him with my dad, you know, I mean I don't love him or anything it's just like more into my mum's.

In those in those days in those years as well as what I've just said and me and my mum and my brother, we went to a running club. We used to go and watch athletics, you know, things like that. There was this social scene going on which my dad wanted nothing to do with as well. He could have met some nice people, good people. So you know this is a bit about my life when I'm younger.

So eventually I'm actually, I'm only 11 or 9 and my dad, they've split up. My dad's got a house, my mom's moved away. Dad's got me. I'm just at this stage of my life, I'm really paying no notice. My dad's working so hard, yeah you know. Get up in the morning, I wouldn't necessarily see him. Come home, [wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=402s) necessarily see him. I didn't particularly want to see him either, not that, no love, just generally, yeah, dad's dad. Didn't have a real close one. Although we did. Although we did, I'll talk about that.

But very busy, very busy. And then all of a sudden I came home and just joined secondary school. And I'm coming, I think it's Tuesday, I can't remember, Tuesday evening, and he said to me right Dean I've got something to tell you because I literally would come home, get my bike and hang out with friends and I had a lot of friends. And back you and my era was more the era, I mean these days you call your friends online you play, but this era of mine being 50 was the year of literally all the kids finishing school and going out and meeting on their bikes and hanging around until it got dark and stuff. I was really in that culture.

So when my dad came and said, we're going to the Brethren, I knew who the Brethren were. And, you know, they were obviously considered by, as a child, considered pretty weird. They dressed pretty weird, obviously, you know. No one knew them, really. I have memories of being a kid, being on our bikes, being outside the Brethren meeting room, going round and round in circles on our bikes and Brethren people, like the girls, knew who I was so they were kind of smiling at me and things like that. My friends were like, do you know them? And I didn't know them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=502s)

So when you were growing up as a kid with your mum, did you have much awareness of who these people were? Did you really understand much about them?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=512s)

My dad was much more Victorian. His side of the family were quite Victorian. My grandmother and they all left over Aberdeen, all my dad's side of the family. They all left and they absolutely wanted nothing to do with the brethren. They were open brethren. My grandmother looked like, if someone said draw a grandmother, my grandmother looked like an artist who'd drawn a grandmother. She was really quite something. Yeah. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=547s) I thought personally they were quite Victorian and quite mad I think as well. Mm. And I didn't, I didn't, my granddad didn't get, but she was lovely and my dad, I saw quite a lot of my dad's side of the family, but none, not one of my dad's side and family, they all left the brethren.

All my dad, I remember there being religious bickering. There's something going on that was serious. They were arguing and I'm really young here now. I can remember they were arguing. Anyway, I think I know what that was about now. And my dad was quite philosophical. Like, if you spoke to my dad, so my dad would really go into it with scriptures and get really quite passionate about talking about scriptures and you should read this and you should read that. And I wasn't having a bar of it, really. I was free on another level.

Just wasn't, I couldn't take that on board, really, this god thing you need to believe in when life's just out around the corner you know like. And my dad wasn't a particularly strict man either. I know other people have got stories of incredibly strict parents. My dad wasn't powerful like that. He was, you know, yeah I mean what I got away with if I'd had this like if my dad had been a real bastard, he would just tanned my arse and just said, you are not that. In a way, I continued to do what I wanted to do, which was just hang out with pals, basically. And I didn't stop doing that, even when I joined the brethren.

But I just continued to go. I knew I had. I'm in this place that brought me in on a meeting night. I remember actually I didn't cry that much in the kid but I did cry when my dad said we're going to the Brethren Church and I'm like what?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=679s)

Was that one evening then?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=682s)

Yeah it was one evening. I didn't see that coming. I was too young still. Yeah. Yeah we're going to the Brethren Church. I mean dawning on me we're joining the Brethren Church and for me that's really bad. You know that time my brother Andrew is like brilliant, my brother Andrew is always his father's son.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=706s)

And how old would he have been at the time? You were about 11 at this time so he would have been sorry, about 15, a little bit older than you.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=715s)

Yeah, yeah everyone was one year younger. But Andrew is always really taken in by, like just telling religion, God and Jesus. Because that's kind of the thing with me. What I've learned in life is really what my brother's obsession with religion, when he was only 15 years old, and how mentally he was about it all. It was quite freaky. And he was highly intelligent, actually, because I didn't do very well at school.

I was immature, for one, in my course, and I wasn't paying attention so I don't know really I can't as I used to say but Andrew my eldest brother was set one, set one for maths and could help the maths teacher. He also was very clever with computers and he knew all about computers and again at school he was helping the teacher in school with all [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=782s) stuff. So highly intelligent guy I believe. I haven't seen him for a long time and he's very heavy, he's very like it's you know that when you're rigid you know you almost do some yoga.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=799s)

Do some stretches. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So your dad took all three of you boys into the brethren at those ages, is that what happened?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=812s)

Yeah. It was horrible. I said to my dad, he sat down and said we're getting divorced. I knew my dad's life kind of meant, I knew my mum's life was fun. Her life was fun. I mean, you know, my mum, yeah, yeah, you know, they were partying, they were drinking, you know, they were earning good money. It was fun. And my dad's life was anything but fun, seriously. But both my elder brothers, they both said to my mum, no, [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=851s) cutting you off, sort of thing. So this is before I joined the Brethren, both of my brothers have said, one quite sternly and one really quite, you know, tearfully.

I remember that. And that's before we joined the Brethren, probably not long before, obviously, weeks or months. It was when we moved and the house split. But yeah. Yeah. But they both said first visit we all went to see my mum and Andrew and Kevin both said, no, we're not doing this. And I was like, I didn't even, I don't think I even thought about it that much. And that's what led to a mental… You know, what's the problem? But, you know, they like music, they sort of hang out and drink wine and blah, blah, blah.

Yeah, so that was that. So, I mean, some of that was quite... I mean, Bob, the guy that married my mum, before we got married, he had some houses down in France and the Dordogne, and my dad and his wife we all, I remember going on, we went on holiday a load of us and Bob who's my man, they're a young family, two young families obviously fell in love, which they [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=942s), but there was this holiday. So my dad went over to the Dordogne and you know probably didn't blend well. These guys were young, Bob was the surveyor, I think one of the guys that was out there was an architect sort of carrying on. You know, young people doing well, but the Brethren's not about that lifestyle at all, is it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=973s)

Well, it wasn't back then, I think it probably is now, but it's what they say. I agree with you back then.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=981s)

The wealth thing which I'm learning about, I can't help but keep learning a bit about the brethren, but I must admit this kind of Bruce Hales money thing, like, and whisky thing, like, you know, I don't remember the whisky being like a huge problem around brethren. I'm not sure if they say the whisky thing is quite a big deal, doesn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1008s)

Yeah, alcohol is quite a big deal, they say. So what actually happened then when your dad said we're going back to the Brethren with you boys, and then they got divorced, then did you stay in the Brethren for a few years? What sort of happened?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1022s)

Oh no, hang on, let's get this round the right way. So they got divorced, and then my dad had us three boys. My mum was living in a little cottage thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1036s)

Oh, right. So your dad's kept the three of you at that point?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1048s)

Yeah, he got custody of all three of us.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1048s)

Right. So do you know how he got custody? That's quite interesting. Because it's unusual, isn't it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1048s)

Yeah, I don't think my mum, I think my mum's kind of, what would the brethren, I think she just saw an escape there and wasn't made a deal. Yeah, you know, you take the boys, I'm too busy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1062s)

And your mum, she was born into the Brethren, wasn't she?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1068s)

She was born into the Brethren, yeah. I can tell you more about her, she was very keen to work early. She got into work and she wanted to do something, and there wasn't an ounce of brethren enough. There was nothing about her like a brethren lady. She wasn't particularly wild, she was pretty conservative, loved the Queen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1097s)

So how did it feel having, and I'm thinking this would have been what early 80s when you joined, so how did it feel having had a relatively free normal childhood to suddenly go into the restrictions that were there at the time?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1116s)

The restrictions weren't actually mine no. I didn't feel, I didn't feel but I had a bit of rebellion in me and I kind of like you've brought me here and this is the truth actually but you brought me here almost against my will. When I walked into that room I didn't hold that action, this is more to the point. 11 years old, I walk into a meeting room, you don't know, you know about 10 of them maybe, and obviously a few from school, and then you just go, how many people would have been involved? A couple of hundred, didn't there?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1157s)

Yeah, probably 300 people.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1159s)

So that's it, we're back in the room. We sit down looking at all these people and everyone's looking at me. Everyone I look at smiles at me. Then I finish that meeting and then I'm as happy as Larry outside and chat with a load of kids, you know, a load of kids and they all like seemed pretty cool. I didn't know they looked like.

So and then you know you go back and then basically my dad's back in the Brethren, we're in. How did you see that coming? So then you're going, all I'd say is that my dad couldn't stop me doing, I wouldn't have it. I'd come home from school, I missed a lot of meetings, just coming from school and going out on my bike and I wasn't having it. I wasn't like, but more about the Brethren, the Brethren completely freaked me out. I mean it did completely freak me out really like you know, prayer meetings, getting up at [six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1226s) o'clock in the morning. All I know is that I didn't want that but when you join you meet all these people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1233s)

Yeah so just to explain Dean if I can just explain for the viewers perhaps that don't know the brethren you would have gone from a childhood that was free in the evening school during the day and so on to a life where you had a meeting every evening and on Saturday morning and five or six times on a Sunday.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1254s)

They were trying to sell me this lifestyle, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1257s)

Yeah, just to explain to people that don't perhaps understand the contrast if they don't, yeah.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1263s)

Yeah, so I mean there's not only that and then I go in and I've had my life and I am who I am and I'm a show-off especially as a kid you know like I did this I did that or you know you meet these kids they're 11 years old or they're 12 years old and I immediately met Charles Dunn's boys straight away, worked out that they've like been taken away from Charles and Pansy, learning about that. And then going to Alan Lynes's house and that's where they were living and all his family was split up. That was my dad's priest that used to visit him.

So that was quite something. And then their mum having a massive breakdown in front of the whole, she stayed out for a few years and then she came back she was pale as a sheet and she looked absolutely full of fear and she kind of screamed and her head went back and she was a broken, completely broken woman. I think they're taking her away from Charles Dunn, [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1344s) know what happened there but kind of learning about that side of the brethren, it’s like what's going on here? 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1352s)

What's what you're referring to is the sort of when something happens to a family, either somebody's unwell or leaves the brethren that the younger children will go and live with other brethren's families and a lot of people are saying that on the podcast. And did you find that sort of a bit odd coming to that because for us being brought up with it it was our normal as children wasn't it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1374s)

I mean I found that, I kind of learned but that, wow, how bizarre is that? Yeah, it's hard to explain to you how much l was just like, observing them and I never felt like the people you've like had in podcasts before have really grown up in it, and I most definitely did not, but I still got taken in at age 11\.

 I was given [priestly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1404s) visits like long priestly visits where all I can remember is the guy Mr Greenaway whatever about once every three quarters of an hour, would say,“Do you take Lord Jesus Christ as your savior blah blah…” and at age 14, 15 I was thinking Get me out of here\! What is this? Yeah I just [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1435s) want to be there, thank you very much.   
But it really instills a fear in you I think.  I found myself later on in life, I don't see it as a waste of time now, but I can see how that affects your thought process having all that drama.

 It depends on where you want, where you want to come out but it does upset your thought process when you're trying to, like me, I think it all hit me when I was 18, 19, you know what college is like and getting into music and mild drugs and things and really thinking, thinking, thinking. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1479s) I realised that now that I was thinking, thinking, thinking, and I kind of ended up becoming quite ill, I would have said. I sort of developed a form of psychosis.

 I believe in, what's the word I'm looking for? You know, I've gone off a couple of years now and I've been really enjoying music, for instance, like Fleetwood Mac, and discovering music I hadn't heard before and really taking it massively seriously that Brethren wouldn't allow music and really overthinking it.

You can be in a family and a Brethren, you can listen to the Beatles and you might end up shut up or something for six months of life. Yeah. Like, I'm thinking, what? And I'm listening to all this new music, I'm getting high, you know, and things actually went from bad to worse. And I had a bad trip. I say it wasn't a bad trip, bad trip, but I felt that strings got cut off my fingers, and when I came round I went home and my parents found me and they sounded like demons.

I was looking out the window and the world was cartoon that was coming to a stop and I thought it was the rapture and then I opened the Bible and I'm having a crazy trip. I've done something I shouldn't have done, which the Beatles did. I'm having a quite seriously hard time. And it resulted in me being... What that did to me, kind of like these... Some people were granular, I felt like I was getting picked up, I felt it was really kind of like, almost Messiah-like, and then I'm doing this trip and I'm like, bad, freaky things are happening, and I came out of it the next day and I was just like what happened last night? Oh the rapture\!

**Jacky Hart**

And that's what you thought\!

**Dean Wheeler**

No no no yeah sort of thing and then it just yeah, I really struggled with my mental health really quite seriously I would have said, for a good year or more, but really quite bad resulting in a sort of psychotic kind of breakdown where I got really high,not with any substance or something and started behaving really sort of [weirdly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1637s) around town and like too much energy and very very thin.

I went really completely bonkers for a little while there and ended up in a nut house, mental hospital, institution, where they locked me up as well for about two months I suppose. They locked me up when I think back I was a young guy there, I, you know, I was in cloud cuckoo land with it all. You know, if I say anything about it now it's kind of a God religion overload which had manifested itself in my brain and it's not …I feel good to say that I have survived that but it was messy at times you know, that was definitely messy at times. I scared the living daylights out…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1698s)

About that time, were you about 18, 19?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1701s)

Oh, 18, 19, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1702s)

So you'd been in the Brethren for what, seven, eight years, that kind of time frame? When you became unwell?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1713s)

Yeah, they, they, I joined. Oh, I joined a gang of bricklayers as well and I kind of left the Brethren and joined this, lovely in a way but yeah you go from that lifestyle and then they actually kicked me out. I'm 16 years old and I've just left school and then bang I'm in a gang of bricklayers from Horley like working with them like and that they are different people to the brethren and yeah I've formed memories but they're pretty wild some of those guys. I said oh yeah I'll be a bricklayer dad. He said, oh, do you think about being a [plumber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1750s) or a glazier?

No, my friend was going to be a bricklayer so I just chose bricklayer because I didn't do well at school whereas both my brothers excelled in mathematics and English. But yeah, so all of a sudden I'm on a bricklaying site with a load of lads and you know, we're back in 1987 and it was pub culture and I was up for it. You go out and have some great times. I really got into the music scene, I must admit. I travel all over the place to see bands and things.

I'm in love with music, for sure. And music is always the tops like that. I remember having, you know, just, like, what is it? What is it? Like, God and the brethren banning this music and God? and you know, so I was thinking about it, thinking about it, making myself feel about it I suppose, as a young guy who didn't really know much.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1833s)

And in that timeframe at all, did you see your mother at all in those teen years?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1839s)

Oh, I was living with her. I left the brethren and went to live with my mum.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1843s)

Oh right, sorry, I thought you were with your dad for that timeframe. Or were you going between the two?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1848s)

No, no, no. Sorry, what I've done, because I know I'd do this. You've got to stick around more. It's okay. It's fine. We've got to keep it structured. No, no, it's fine. Well, it is, I leave my dad from age 11, because I thought I was going to talk more and tell more stories about, but you tend to flip forward. Fine. 11 to 16 in the Brethren. Right. A lot happened. Yeah. I did just flip forward there. But a lot happened in those four years. I didn't want to get too slow. But I always treated the place like a hotel. I didn't. And I wasn't scared about being kicked out either.

What actually happened was I just carried on. And I, you know, there was, when you talk about, I don't know what it's like in London, in places like that, like, it didn't seem like it was as much fun, where I lived in Croydon and Reigate as in there was quite a young youngster scene and the kids weren't too heavy because some of those brethren children are seriously bibled out aren't they, you know, they're really like you know just good. I don't know what it is but they're not allowed to do it, they can't go out, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=1929s) can't do anything they can't go down the cinema they can't and they listen to their dad you know.

I suppose we're talking about it I'm pleased that I had a rebellious kind of…but my rebelliousness has brought me problems. Like I say happy ended but it is,  my rebellion,  so,quite a bit different now I've done some. It's quite a big thing for your dad to take you into a religion and take you to church and introduce you to your mum's parents, that was odd, and introduced me to like her brothers and I didn't think it was kind of like this.

We join the brethren and we go to them and we stay with them. And this is, and then when I go back, you know, after staying with them, I just go and see my mother and say to my mother, I just spent like three days with your two brothers and your dad and your mum.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2002s)

And your mum never saw them?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2003s)

She wasn't around to them? No, no, the thing is, my mum was quite strong in many ways, and when she left, she left, and she didn't show me much emotion, she didn't cry to me about how much she loved her dad or anything. Yeah, no, she didn't, like, some people are very, you know, sort of, she kind of left them behind, I think. Yeah. Not like she didn't care about them, I think she cared about them. But yes, she ended up with me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2036s)

But it may have been a way of coping. It may have been her way of coping because she knew that when she left.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2041s)

She said to me she thought her mum was stupid.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2044s)

Yeah.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2045s)

Yeah. So I don't know. They definitely didn't have a fantastic relationship. She never, I mean she didn't really slate or anything, but she just sort of said she didn't do anything, she just sort of kind of whinged a bit or something yeah yeah yeah. And she waffled on about her dad, really her dad was quite a cheerful guy, Noddy I believe isn't it he was quite a cheerful [soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2077s). They were a little less victorian than my dad's side of the family they were quite a victorian bunch right?

But yeah what the damaged me I suppose you know, you can overdo God I think. I don't like to challenge christians I'm not interested challenging christians I'd rather not get involved and you know but for me I found the whole seriousness of the God and their scriptures and their hells and their yeah I found that obviously, like I think I suffered from a kind of religious trauma anyway through my actions as well definitely.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2138s)

Yeah and also religion can become almost an addiction. I know somebody gave me a book that's called when God becomes a drug. Yeah so it can, I mean to be honest I still got to read the book I haven't dipped into it yet but it just it goes into how you know, religion can become an addiction almost.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2162s)

Well that makes sense it's like, but like for me especially I mean I don't know and some kids would but they would read the ministry as kids you know there's no I never read one. I don't know I, I don't think I can't remember one meeting really as such because you'd just be looking around.

Yeah other points I've got some minutes other points as far as joining the brethren, one thing that hadn't happened in my life before I'd never been around babies before and all of a sudden you're getting to know all these children babies that's actually quite nice so you know yeah yeah that little baby she's getting really cute now and oh look you know they get really toddlers they're no longer babies and someone might hand you a baby or [whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2227s) a break or whatever and you'd go around breaks and play guitar.

Oh and they'd give you a beer that was another thing I was quite impressed when I joined the brethren you know you are 11 and you go and sit down in someone's house and say would you like a beer? Yeah I'll have a beer they give me a cold beer.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2253s)

Yeah I don't know how it was in your day Dean but I know when I was growing up around about that age they were always strong, most places it was a strong beer you know like a Tennants Super or a Carlsberg Special Brew or something like that.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2266s)

Yeah they went to their beer they were into their… I mean, there was quite a few, like, more of, I suppose that's what I liked about my existence there in those few years. There was a rebellious nature to a lot of them. And it's funny, isn't it? Like, they didn't have, because it was all the way back there in the 80s. I mean, these two guys, these two twins from Reigate, the Douglas Twins, they bought taxis and hack about in their taxes [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2302s) we had we had fun yeah we were skidding up the road. I mean if you get that now someone you went around some private cul-de-sac roads or private roads with the taxi like sledging all around the place I don't think you get away with it these days. But yeah pretty crazy like that weren't they you know.

But yeah, let's get out and hack our cars or, you know, listen to music. That was the one that always really fascinated me. Like, you can't listen to this music. That was the one that kind of, because I, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2342s)

So for you, that was a real sticking point because the Brethren were very, I mean, I remember the year of the late 70s, early 80s, and there was this big thing about pre-recorded music, you could play a guitar and sing, but listening to pre-recorded music, so to listen as you say to the original was just the biggest sin.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2363s)

Oh yes, and that's exactly where you're, like, I never really questioned how wrong this might be. You're in with these guys, you're in with this religion, and there's hundreds of them, and you've just been introduced to your mum's family and, well my mother would always like members of my dad's family but never around but just because I think what with me, you know my dad's mom when I was, yeah my grandmother, she left me quite a lot of money actually and funny thing was it happened just one friend of mine was going to Canada and, yeah my dad's mum left me 15,000 pounds and I just was thinking about this Canada trip and all of a sudden it's completely affordable that was nice and I went to Canada and I went to Toronto.

So my friends were playing folk festivals over there they were folk festivals. So I went to Toronto, I went to the Winnipeg Folk Festival, met some friends there. Oh no, I've got to tell you about the flight. Yeah, I'll tell you a good story. I got a flight from Toronto to Winnipeg and the plane was empty and there was just about 10 massive black guys all in one area of the plane. So I go down and look at my ticket and see my seat and see this massive guy and he's actually in my seat and I know he's loads of other seats. But I did, I went over and I said, anyway, it turned out they were a Miami gospel band and the guy that was [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2470s) my seat was blind.

Actually massive and huge. And they were lovely and they were playing these places I was going to, lovely people, they were called New Orleans type gospel. I love gospel music you know I love that stuff and funny enough so is my son with his drumming and he loved it when he was a kid he googled gospel drummers and stuff so that was really nice that was an experience. That was that was a nice thing to happen so yeah it ended up in Winnipeg. I remember thinking this is where Mr Symingtons, that brother… Oh, yeah.

Canada's a wonderful place. Crumbs, that's a really nice place to go to. Definitely. And it's up in Vancouver. I went twice actually with her money. I went back two years later and went to Whitehorse up into the, by Dawson City. The music parties there. I just went to them, like my music wheel, I certainly wasn't a player. I went along and experienced something different. In Dawson City there was an hour of twilight before the 23 hours of sunlight. Fantastic place to be.

But I wouldn't, yeah, I wouldn't, I've been seeing my dad a couple of times, and my brothers, we could talk about the review. They turned up out of the blue. I think my mum refused, I think she did chat to one of them and she was like, I don't know what all that was about. My brother came around to see me and I just didn't know what all that was about really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2592s)

So that would have been quite a few years after, so you left at 16 and then presumably you didn't see your father and your brothers for a good few years then?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2604s)

Oh, not for many years. No, not for a long time actually. Well, it wasn't that long where I had the mental illness episode really scarred my younger life. It really did get a hold of me. It was a psychotic thing and it was like, you know, kind of anointed for what I was talking to God, blah blah blah. The whole thing ends up in a lot of paranoia, a lot of panic attacks, a lot of like really not being very well at all, really. That's nature of what happened to me. But I'd like, I'm pleased to say that after a couple of years I've gotten the better end of it and I've gotten an alright life with a lot of help, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2651s)

So how did you work that through? Do you think that was, if you like, I'd probably sympathise it but a reaction to that change at 11 years old and the pressure?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2663s)

I think I did take God and religion quite seriously. I don't like to come out and say you know I can't be bothered to say I don't believe in anything only because I don't like saying it, not because it's just like I will if you don't you know, at least come out yeah. Yeah, make it, turn it into a science fiction novel at least. Yeah, it's pretty dry what they're doing in there, isn't it? It's not like, what can you say, holy?

I've had a lot of fun, you know, I've been seeing a lot of good music, I've been to wonderful festivals, met some wonderful people, and you know, although that can be like, sometimes you're dicing you know with like drinking too much or whatever, yeah you know like go to Bristol. Yeah yeah and don't be free, yeah you know being fearful like you know you gotta try and behave yourself you know we all know that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2740s)

You can attempt.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2745s)

It's been fun.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2746s)

It's been fun. Once you got yourself better and got on an even keel.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2753s)

Well I did get myself better, but surely. With help I'm sure. And you had your mum. Yeah I did. I did. I think I was really scared. One thing I struggled with, I did really scare her actually at that time, it wasn't you know started getting quite out of hand mentally really you know so it was a struggle and it, I think it was a form of religious trauma. So maybe [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2784s) people…but perhaps I took it all to heart and if you think about what they're talking about it's quite, unless you if don't you don't stay there and leave all these people and no one else gives a monkey is what these people are saying, but you've had quite a few years of it in your childhood I suppose I think that's what it was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2805s)

Yeah and I also think with your story which is quite interesting so Gilli and Ross and I were all born into it and we knew no different we that was it that was our life up until we left whereas you had a life that was I suppose what most people just think is a normal childhood life you know mixing with kids eating with kids going to and so on yeah and then suddenly that was sort of clamped down on and you had…but more to the point these people were just saying like come you know be with us come with us but obviously they would they wanted to make the decision.

**Dean Wheeler**

 Yeah I had to cut off ties with my mum which was something I wasn't going to do, I knew that I wasn't going to do and I started refusing to get up for the supper.

Yeah. That wasn't making any sense to me. I think I missed it for the last 10 weeks or something. Mm-hmm. My dad didn't have the, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2865s) wasn't getting me out of bed to go to that, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2872s)

And did your father remarry when you went back into the Brethren?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2875s)

Eventually.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2877s)

Yeah. Because that's quite unusual, isn't it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2881s)

Yeah. It never happened when I was in there. Because it was after you'd left from... Oh yeah. Well, I left. Kevin was just starting to hang around in the car park with the girl he eventually married. My brother Kevin. When Andrew got married a little bit later on. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2910s)

Yeah. And then you mentioned the review which was sort of early 2003, something like that wasn't it, where we, a lot of us left, got visits from family in. What happened to you with your father and brothers at that point then?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2926s)

Well my brother gave me a big brick wall to build.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2929s)

Okay.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=2930s)

Yeah, and I it was quite a big job actually and Kevin didn't seem much… I did a load of brick work for my dad, oh he had a bungalow and you know I haven't even put this in my notes. The review. Yeah. We obviously hadn't had much to do with each other. I'd been through the really unwell stage of my life. Just gone through that and got to the review and I hadn't really found a great deal of direction in life in a way. But let me carry on.

All of a sudden, Andrew, I think it was, turned up. He's coming around and I had a friend round and we were drinking and just having some beers. I can remember one friend who was there and my friend, he had a big birthmark on his face and he looked quite... he wasn't he wasn't a menacing guy at all really if you looked at him he had this great red birthmark across his face and he was my friend, a builder and that so he came around and [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3008s) having a beer and I said, come in then they didn't hang around for long but I can remember just kind of talking to them and Andrew my brother, Andrew’s really stiff it's kind of like, Uh, uh, uh. Yeah you're not getting much out of him but he’s kind of like letting me know that you're right, you've been forgiven, … I wasn't having much but I weren't rude to him by any means.

But my dad, I did quite a lot of brick work for my dad and on his house. Then I did quite a lot of brickwork for Kevin, but I remember [Kevin,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3049s) when me and Kevin were kids, we were close kids and then we got a bit older and he had his.., but we were definitely close. We were definitely close. And Kevin was closer to my mum. I think my mum would have liked it if he had not gone to the brethren, but he did. Because Kevin liked running and we did the running clubs and you know, kind of didn't get the impression Kevin was particularly …but he was, you know, he stayed. I was talking about Kevin.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3082s)

You're talking about the review. If I could just explain, Dean, for the people who perhaps, I know it has been explained before, but we all know what the review is. But basically it was when, I think it was, I mean, Gilli, you would have been, you're both in it this time, won't you? So Bruce Hales said something about contacting, and maybe one of you could just explain a bit better because I wasn't in at that time, what the review involved for people that don't know.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3110s)

So it was essentially, so Bruce Hales's father John Hales had passed away in 2001 I think, and it kind of been, I suppose there'd been a kind of a regime sort of that operated for years under under John Hales and had sort of been, I guess every locality had their top dogs who had just sort of run things unchallenged and obviously had dealt with people in a lot of cases very harshly and there was cases where I mean that's the thing, it's just to most people tell of these stories and they're just like crumbs right yeah.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3150s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3162s)

Yeah, yeah I mean I remember a story of a, I mean he's a lot older than me but of a lad it was where I, well he would have been a lad at that time and he was 16 you know and he was kicked out of his parents house and had to live in his you know in his car and stuff like that. So there was a lot of stuff like that that had gone over the years and I think when Bruce Hales came to the fore he was kind of I guess trying to well I suppose looking back on it it's probably a bit of the PR campaign starting to try and make things look better and you know apologize for misdemeanors that had happened under the old regime and and I think probably I mean Ross you probably remember it but at that time there was, I think because that kind of there was that thing of going back over stuff that was wrong, I guess a lot of the peebs had sort of almost started to swing the other way I guess.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3224s)

I was going to say around that time things started to become almost quite free and easy and you're allowed to sort of like get away with things that you probably wouldn't have done before is that what you remember Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3237s)

Yeah and and it certainly became then it sort of then became like this yeah like you say this free and easy stage and there was a lot of stuff that brethren hadn't done previously and you know people were wearing stuff that people were wearing to the meeting had never you know people wearing denim and stuff to the meeting which had been banned for years.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3262s)

And another thing I know in Peterborough around about that time, sorry Dean.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3272s)

I just remember like Reigate and Redhill being a bit rebellious as in a lot of people would tart themselves up a bit you know it's not really what they wanted was it it's not what everyone was like don't make yourself like don't wear a flashy shirt don't wear my shoes yeah it's not really it's not really what we're all about.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3299s)

And also around about that time in Peterborough I can remember that, I think some ministry had come out that had said it didn't matter where you sat in the meeting obviously the sisters would still have to sit behind the the brothers but I know in Peterborough, us young ones always used to try and get to the meeting really early so we'd go down on the front row and sit on the front row.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3328s)

But the upshot of all that was the front row thing did, I mean I never learned about that, but the front row thing did kind of make me laugh as in, what was it, an unwritten rule. You can sit where you like but if you sit in the front row.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3346s)

Yeah so you know we we that's what we did so we could all sit on the front row and push all the others onto the second and third row.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3354s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3355s)

But then you know just after the review Bruce Hales clamped right down and that was obviously his invention all the way along.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3363s)

The upshot of that was I think probably the same for you Dean is that those of us that were out at that time suddenly got visits from family we hadn't seen for donkeys years and that in itself, yeah you know you got that Dean was quite traumatic in itself.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3380s)

My mum had, sure she did we didn't see anyone together but she did just get a visit but that's because she got a visit from either Andrew or Kevin I think she had someone like Charles, a couple of other brothers or whatever like meet like popped round to see her, like not not Andrew or Kevin , because it did get brushed aside a bit that, because I remember, I didn't realise at the time it was such a big deal.

 I just thought oh my other brethren are coming to talk to me or why is my brother come because my brother came to talk to me. I can't remember who it was who he was with now we had quite a, I don't remember. My mum passed eight years ago and obviously that was a traumatic thing, obviously cancer is a very traumatic thing but she thought it, well we had some great times.

Well it did take her in the end and by you know you're kind of like all over the place and whatnot and I drove you you know my son was very close to her. So when we're going to her funeral, up at the funeral and we came outside and there was my brother Andrew and my brother Kevin and Charles Gurr and they were behind the fence, they were off church land and they're looking in. My brother Kevin was the only one visibly upset but yeah they wouldn't, so when the coffin came out they would wait but they wouldn't stand on the church land. I mean this is bizarre for anyone.

**Jacky Hart**

So they came to the funeral they came to your mum's…

**Dean Wheeler**

 They came to her funeral, didn't didn't even stand on the church ground so they stood outside on the pavement [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3517s) behind the fence looking in, and I hadn't really seen any of Andrew and Kevin for a long time and I didn't find Kevin a great talker but he was really upset , Kevin. He was like, I wasn't crying, you know. He was, which is odd because I've just been to my mother's funeral and she died six or seven days ago, whatever, blah, blah, blah. And all of a sudden my brother's standing behind a fence and not mixing with any of us, like really upset, which is rare. I mean, he was the one that, he loved my mum, I'm sure he did, but he did just do the brethren thing and that was that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3555s)

That in a way, that's a really interesting insight because one thing that's come out with these chats with a few ex-brethren is that there's a lot of hurt caused for us that leave and lose family, but there's also a lot of hurt for those inside. And I know, and I'm thinking of your brother Kevin he lost his mum.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3577s)

I didn't fellbad I was more shocked I think.I was, to see my brother there crying and I'm feeling that emotion right now, but I'd done the whole ceremony and all the build-up you know yeah I played a song in there and you know and I came out and then I was really quite shocked not “shocked shocked” but I was shocked, my two brothers. Not only that, there's a lot of guests as well. And [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3608s) lot of those guests are people that know my brother and remember him from when we were younger. And they've walked around the outside of the church and they stayed the other side of the fence.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3627s)

I suppose your brother Kevin wouldn't have, I mean if you lose somebody very dear to you, normally although it's terribly sad, you can have happy memories at times and you said you had some good times with your mum, whereas your brother wouldn't have that, would he?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3647s)

Yeah, I suppose. I don't know, I don't know how he felt, I'm guessing. He was very close to my mum as a young boy, but just didn't, obviously was close enough to dad to take my dad's path on hand. But he got married pretty quick as well. I think he did quite, you say he did quite well. He had a big family and lives in a whopping great big house. So I hope he ever had a wonderful life, you know, because I thought another thing, although the brethren, they were kind of considered, weirdos or what not by the world or by the people I like, like school friends, you know, I wouldn't tell them about my association with the brethren, for instance.

But, I mean, there's something about, you know, when you get, I can remember sitting in like the amphitheatre, what it was, before I left, I can remember looking at every person and knowing every single one of their names, now in the meeting of Reigate and Croydon I think that was around about [500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3716s) people I think so and I remember thinking there's know her name know her name know  her name know her name now that's just like unheard of now but it's amazing like so when I'm talking about the religious trauma when they take you, they took me to this place where you go to church, all those breaks and all those dinners when you're at that age, like 11, 16, all those [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3747s) of times.

Some people were better than others. I can remember people like the Douglas family, you know. And then you had to go home for lunches. Well, I'd never done that before, obviously. And we used to go to a lovely house and have lunch, me and Glen Dunn and Will Dunn and a few others. And they're very happy memories, actually. You know, that kind of, you know, Mrs Douglas with her headscarf on, pulling out a baked tray of fish fingers and chips for a load of 12, 13-year-olds. you know the brethren definitely had something you know that was in that kind of world that sort of you know.

Obviously quite wealthy as well i mean a lot of my friends from school lived in the council estate around the corner you know, no detached house there. Some of my, I had a bit of both actually yeah when you're young yeah you might if you're worldly like I was. I was more worldly than my brothers I was more of a free spirit as you know. I got home I went out my bike you know I pinched my dad's money because I was things like I was naughty you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3826s) and yeah as a yeah I was a pretty free spirit as a youngster for sure and my dad and their problems enabled that to be probably, possibly freer than it should have been maybe.

Oh yeah come home at nine o'clock at night dark as a quite a young kid I come in and mum would be in and dad would still be in the attic to tapping away on his accounts you know [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3856s) like that which is you know I can only kind of, I look back in fondness about it in a way, but it's such a different ideal actually to what, you know…

Then my dad takes you to a place where the world is nothing like that, you know. I sometimes wonder what the ideal actually is all meant to be about because like that family thing, that sort of coming home for lunch and did they all do that?

**Ross Turner**

 I was going to say when you were talking about the breaks.. 

**Dean Wheeler**

But I'm talking also kids going around brethren houses at lunch time for dinner and the breaks and a lot of those guys actually that was a really nice house then you know, about these big houses and things you know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3919s)

Talking about would that have been in the 80s, sorry the breaks you're talking about would that have been in the 80s?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3929s)

Oh yeah I was only in in the 80s well. About 82 to 86\.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3935s)

Yeah because I remember it in there in the 80s and the breaks were they were just like big big meals but you know it was all sorts of.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3949s)

Yeah, with an Asterix book.

**Jacky Hart**

Yes, Dean, I remember Asterix very well.

**Dean Wheeler**

.You've done an Asterix book and you've done a whole beer when you're 12\. Yeah. It depends on where you went. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3965s)

But nowadays the breaks of meals have totally changed. You know, everything has to be the best and everybody outdoing each other, it's you know it's not like I don't know it's not I remember it not being anything like it was back in the 80s it was far more free and easy in the 80s.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=3982s)

Yeah and and I've heard stories I don't remember, I don't think I was old enough to pick up on it, but I've heard that like you could be poor in the Brethren, you could be wealthy in the Brethren, I tell you, you know. I'm not sure where my dad was exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4013s)

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4013s) mean I was in the Brethren, I left in the mid-80s and it was I think, I haven't been in it, but I think the big difference was then nobody was particularly judged by the house they lived in and there were Brethren that lived in very nice big detached houses and there were brethren that lived in terraced houses the only thing that was not allowed was a flat because of the shared you know having to share the ground rent, thank you Ross, but apart from that and when people were marrying then you know [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4043s) first home would be a mid-terrace a normal first home because that's what they could afford and that seems to have totally changed now.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4057s)

Yeah, I mean, it depends on how, like there's some wealthy, there's some wealth in there, but I didn't get the impression everyone was rich.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4065s)

No, and I don't think it was money orientated in the way it perhaps what Gilli’s described, his memories of the Brethren, leaving much more recently and Ross as well. I don't think in the late 70s 80s it was all about the money.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4081s)

No okay that seems to be perhaps what well it's more about these days yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4086s)

Yeah because back in the 70s like Jackie's saying back in the 80s you know, whether you're poor or whether you're rich if you're poor you just afforded what you could for the breaks if you're rich you could have really nice food but nowadays you know…

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4107s)

Sorry. I was just saying, Christianity, what exactly is it? What's it meant to be?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4114s)

It's not supposed to be about money, I thought, but anyway. I didn't think it particularly mattered.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4126s)

It's interesting that there is a big, I know it's when I go on the pages of things they love it’s about how rich the houses are, is it right that they wanted money, more money off their flock?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4147s)

I've said this before but it's basically just become a business now, it's not a church.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4153s)

One of the Hales owns oOx Tools, they're big aren't they.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4158s)

Yeah yeah I think that's one of the Hales sons isn't it owns that business but I think yeah, it's interesting isn't it because I think back to my time in the Brethren and there were definitely issues, there was a huge issue with families being split up, there was a huge issue with probably what you'd describe as religious pressure.

 I mean my father nearly had a nervous breakdown and that's part of the reason why we left just because of that religious [pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4188s) but money didn't didn't seem to be a thing in the way it is now, and also what you did for work.

 I think in that era there was a big emphasis on, certainly for my two older brothers, you learn a trade you know, that was it, you learn a trade and you go and work in a trade whereas now it's all about sales and making money isn't it.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4209s)

It became very untrade like though didn't it? There was restrictions on what you could do yeah like work and like academies or whatever you can join and that they kind of stripped everyone of an education I suppose yes, like you know you could before Mr Jim should we say. You had a chance of studying something you know becoming a physicist or something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4242s)

You had a chance of doing what suited your personality.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4246s)

But they did actually take pretty much the whole deal away. You don't go to university.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4256s)

My mum was one of the last ones to go to university in our locality. She became an English teacher. She managed to get in just before it came in that you wouldn't go.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4274s)

What did she get? Did she finish university?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4278s)

She was at Bristol University so she studied English and she got a BA honours in English, a Bachelor of Arts, and became an English teacher for a few years.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4292s)

I mean it's interesting isn't it. So there wasn't any way if you could become a teacher in the Brethren. No there isn't. Once you can't go to university I suppose like in that part of work for, you know, I don't really see, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4308s)

But it wasn't just, you know, not everybody's cut out for going to university, you know, whether you're in the Brethren or not, that's just life, but it wasn't just that because I can remember if I'd had, if somebody said to me what did I want to do for work like they do, my biggest desire would have been to have been a nurse, a general nurse, but that would never ever have been allowed. At the time you would have got a job in the hospital and you'd have trained on the, that would never have been allowed in the Brethren, never, you know. And I remember asking my brother in the Brethren, you know, why would it, to me it's reasonably worthy profession, and the reply I got well you know doing something like being a nurse wouldn't be compatible with the Brethren lifestyle and that was the problem.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4357s)

They will just waffle yeah and that's what I mean, they can't they they cannot be filmed could they, by an intelligent…I mean now imagine them trying to take their argument onto a mainstream setting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4380s)

We'd be more than happy.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4381s)

They haven't got people skilled, they just wouldn't know what was coming next, would they?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4388s)

No, but if they went on to Good Morning Britain or something like that, the interviewers would shred...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4394s)

Maybe we should suggest they start gently by coming on the Get A Life podcast. We'll be kind.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4405s)

They would not get somebody like rubbish yeah you have to…Some people go out and learn that stuff don't they yeah you're gonna get like verbally attacked right.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4419s)

Yeah.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4420s)

Interesting.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4421s)

Yeah but going back to what you said Jacky about it came in at one time about everybody learning a trade, I know in the 80s there was plumbers, bricklayers, electricians and all that in our locality and obviously when it came in that you'd work for a business those people really really struggled.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4442s)

I bet yeah yeah I bet they did because suddenly what they what they've been doing and how they've been earning their living and probably quite happily earning it wasn't acceptable all of a sudden I guess.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4455s)

No, and of course because they're practical people they struggled in the sales role.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4460s)

Yeah, I mean I often think of my brother who is an electrician and he still is an electrician in the Brethren and I feel quite pleased that he hasn't had to, you know, for some reason he hasn't had to do exactly what you've just said Ross and give up something he's probably very good at to take on a sales role that wouldn't be suited to them at all I guess. So yeah.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4484s)

There are quite a few big boys in the brethren, big companies you know. Yeah. Yeah. But somehow they learned that. They must be good at that. My brother, he ends up working for quite a big company. I couldn't get much out of him when I spoke to him but I know we worked for a big blind company, blinds in the city. I went thinking, there could be some money in that. And I think it was something to do with the Douglas’s, Andy Douglas maybe. And he said they did Kensington Palace. They did all the blinds in Kensington Palace and my brother was manager. He was bright, my brother.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4538s)

It's also interesting isn't it because the impression I get and again those I mean Ross and Gilli having left much more recently than I have if you're in business and your business does well it's perceived as God is blessing you. I mean it's like… and yet if you, you know, and what happens if a business doesn't do so well in the Brethren, you know? 

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4567s)

Yeah, if a business doesn't do so well it gets taken over by UBT basically.Well, I don't know, that's what happened when I was in there, I don't know about, is that what happened when you were in there Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4583s)

No, I was just going to say there was a lot of businesses that were “merged” conveniently because they were basically hitting rock bottom and needed someone else to rescue them. But no, I do remember coming back to your point Jackie about businesses doing well. I remember hearing one case of where somebody had got a business and they did it, they took the advice that was given to them by you know higher up in the peebs and and the business [took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4613s) a downturn and the response from higher up was that okay you may have taken the advice on but you didn't you obviously didn't believe it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4629s)

Right yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4630s)

And you know it's just anybody with a logical brain will look at that and go, know the reason it failed was because the advice wasn't right not because you didn't believe in the well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4643s)

It's sort of, the being blessed can sometimes be a little bit selective can't it you know and what does it mean anyway?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4650s)

It's quite an awful thing to say to someone in a way that's what in Christianity or whatever but I mean I smashed my elbow, compound fracture the other day. I fell off the steps in the garden. Never had an accident in a… no I haven't had an accident like that. I'd smashed my elbow it's compound fracture went to hospital amazing how quickly it kind of healed, and also how slowly it healed as well it was tough.

It was great and they put me back together and the steps collapsed on me you know, and I can't say it didn't cross my mind. Did you think it was God's judgment? No, maybe I deserved it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4705s)

It's part of how we've been taught isn't it? It's part of how we've been taught. If it goes wrong it's God's judgment, if it goes right it's God's blessings, but hey, I don't think life's quite that cut and dried, is it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4717s)

No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4717s)

No. Anyway, Dean, it's actually been quite fascinating talking to you because it's a very different perspective about how you had the childhood that was relatively worldly and normal and then you were taken into it and the effect it had on you. It's quite significant, isn't it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4736s)

Yeah, it's been balmy for a while. Yeah, when I left the Brethren, I was listening to the music and I was really cool for a while. And I left the Brethren and all the people wearing cool clothes and listening to music. Yeah, and I got myself in the muddle through being cannabis and LSD, pretty much. I can't put it down to much more than that. Oh, I thought it was so cool when I was young, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4770s) know. Now I can see what happened and it's hard to explain to other people, but it's, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4775s)

Yeah, looking back and reflecting on it and why that might have triggered that kind of, yeah, yeah. Well, Dean, thank you so much. It's been a real pleasure talking to you. Thank you for coming on the podcast. It's been a laugh in places, hasn't it?

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4789s)

Oh, it's something I've had a laugh. So, every... This will take one and a half minutes. Every good meeting when I was young... Yeah. ...had a hymn in it, didn't it? Yeah. I just want to say goodbye to anyone who's listened to this podcast. Just a bit of music. So yeah. That's fantastic. If you just play me out for one minute, that's it. Thank you very much for talking to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4839s)

You can have your minute of music. Do you hear that? We can.

### [**Dean Wheeler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrRf0DM_dY&t=4850s)

We can. Yeah. Anyway, take care. Thank you very much. Dean, thank you.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
