## Summary

Get A Life shares the captivating story of Tom Grace from Adelaide, Australia who left the Exclusive Brethren at age 17 in 1970, after the Aberdeen incident. His raw, authentic vulnerability shines through as he recounts what it was like to make that decision after his parents decided they were done. After leaving, he walks us through what it was like, as a group of ex-exclusive members went back to the fundamental teachings of JT Sr., much like the Renton branch.
After joining his family's building business, Tom's career took off. He started his own successful building company, became a scuba diving instructor, dabbled in underwater photography, and even had a deep desire to study law.
Attending a motivational seminar, Tom was inspired to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer. Writing down his goal of becoming a lawyer in 10 years, he broke it down into smaller steps, including getting a law degree.  Tom's journey of rediscovery didn't come without its challenges. The scars from leaving the religious group haunted him, leading to PTSD. But therapy and self-reflection helped him find clarity and embrace his choices.
Tom's determination paid off as he pursued his law degree, faced rejections, and eventually got accepted into law school. He started his law career at the age of 43 and today, he's recognized as one of South Australia's top lawyers in construction law. Through his story, he encourages others to reevaluate their choices and find the courage to pursue their own paths. Tom shares his experience of finding genuine love, care, and community outside the Exclusive Brethren. From sports clubs to his own law firm, he emphasizes that a sense of belonging and support can come from various sources beyond the group's confinement. This story is one that will warm your heart, bring tears to your eyes but most of all inspire us to make the most out of the freedom we gain after leaving the brethren.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=54s)

Welcome back everyone. I am Cheryl and this is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we have Paul and Bradley joining us and our special guest is Tom Grace from Adelaide. Welcome, Tom. Welcome, Paul and Bradley for joining us. Tom is going to share his story and what it was like for him to be a part of the Exclusive Brethren. His parents were affected by Aberdeen and chose to leave in 1970 when he was 17\. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=85s) are very grateful that you reached out, Tom, and it was perfect timing as we start heading down the split off at Aberdeen. So I'm going to hand it over to you now and you can take us on your journey.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=99s)

Okay, thank you. And it's a pleasure to be welcomed onto the podcast. I've watched a lot of episodes and I suppose my main focus if you like is I think the title Get-A-Life is so appropriate because since I left at the age of 17, I have had a life. I mean it's 53 years ago, I turned 70 this year so my family is Brethren Heritage. [My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=129s) grandfather's grandfather brother was William Kelly. My grandmother as I understand it was baptized by JND himself, John Darby. And so we come from a very, like inner circle if you like, of the brethren and I can honestly say that my childhood was lived in absolute devotion to every possible precept or edict or rule [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=159s) anything you like that the brethren said, that's what we did. Our family was just 100% committed and whatever rule came in, that's what we did. And even towards the end of the 1960s when things became a little bit very unusual, I'll say, we still maintained strict adherence and I'm going to tell a story right at the outset to demonstrate that which will have a sort of a bit of poignancy to it.

So in [1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=190s) the lord revealed to Mr Taylor, and I'm going to use my 10 year old language a little bit here because I think that's how it, that's how it happens, those brethren who were keeping pets were allowing the pets to distract us from service to the assembly and so we, everyone had to get rid of their pets. And if that was a sacrifice of a personal nature, then that was fine because the brethren were and the assembly was everything to our family. [Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=221s) fortunately for us, we had a farm at the time and fortunately for us our dog had just unfortunately for the dog, been run over so we didn't have a dog. But we did have out in the backyard in a cage well away from the house a sulfur crested cockatoo. They're an Australian bird, quite a large cockatoo, very intelligent bird and they, they learn to talk, they have a very good personality and he'd been part of our extended family for 60 [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=251s). So my grandfather had given him to my father to look after. So and he, he talked, he was almost like a part of the family. When you walk past he would say things that were quite unpredictable and almost as though he understood what was going on.

Anyway, it never occurred to us that Cocky would be subject to this ministry because he wasn't an inside pet. We just gave him food. I didn't see him as any obstacle to our devotion to the assembly. But after a few days of mulling over the ministry and hearing how everyone else had, you know, got rid of their dogs or cats or whatever they had, I could see that dad was starting to get troubled about it and eventually one morning at morning tea time on the farm he said, well I think it's time to let Cocky go. And I was, Jim and my brother Jim who's two years, I'm the youngest of six and [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=310s) brother Jim two years older than me and I were at home. And so we went out the backyard, they got the wire cutters and he cut a hole in the side of the cage and I fully expected that Cocky would go to the hole and fly away and and experience what it was to fly probably for the first time in his life. But to the contrary, he went to the other side of the cage and and and huddled in the corner and stayed there. And we were a little bit bemused with all, you know, surely he can [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=340s) that he can get out but he didn't. And he stayed there all day. The next day we came out in the morning and he was sitting on top of the cage as though he was reluctant to leave it. He stayed there most of the day. The next day we came out and he was dead, lying on the ground next to the cage. And as a child, I remember it made a huge impression on me. I'm sorry.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=364s)

No, yeah.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=368s)

And and I remember dad saying, look, he probably wasn't well and it's probably just a coincidence. But you know, on reflection and particularly given what we're about to talk about, when the cage becomes a fiction, those of us who've been trapped inside for so long find it really difficult to understand what it would be like to experience freedom and to go out and fly.

And unfortunately, I know others who have delayed leaving the cage who have gone through similar things in their lives, have not been a great success. And then I look at others who have left like me, who left at the age of 17, and I've just had the most wonderful, superb, varied life. And so my motivation if you like in coming on to talk to you today is to say to people inside who are listening [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=430s) this, get a life. Just seize the opportunity and get a life. And I'm going to back and fill a little bit to explain what I mean by that.

But first of all, I think I need to go to August 1970, Saturday morning meeting in Adelaide. The meeting had finished as usual, everyone was standing up and talking and chatting and suddenly someone picked up a [microphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=460s) and said, would everyone please sit down? And that was the most unusual occurrence of course. And so we all sat down and then proceeded, I think it was Jack Pearson who was my uncle by the way, said that some things had come to light that were quite concerning and there were people saying things about Mr Taylor that shouldn't be said and that some people might have to be shut up, which in brethren speak is kind of the first stage of being excommunicated, I suppose.

One of the brothers who at that stage was quite a vocal brother who had emigrated from the UK only about six or seven years earlier called Harold Bales, then stood up and grabbed a microphone and started to say that something had happened in Aberdeen the previous week and that that's and he wanted us to know what had happened in Aberdeen. And he was immediately shut up and told to sit down and be quiet. And so there was like this big ripple went around the room and then he was told to leave. So he got up and left, his wife walked out with him and their three children walked out. And then another family had also [immigrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=539s) from the UK not long before, walked out as well, the Temple family. So there was two small families that walked out in a 500 member congregation in Adelaide.

And of course that intrigued everyone as to, you know, what on earth had happened because these were people who are 100% committed to the brethren until the previous day. And so ripples started to follow and people wanted to know. And then we were told you mustn't ask, you mustn't talk about it. And then of course we began to hear the rumors [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=570s) these meetings that occurred, the fact that Mr Taylor had obviously been inebriated during those meetings and then that perhaps something had happened at one of the houses in Aberdeen. So Bradley, you know probably more about the details of all of that and I, I didn't know, I was 17 at the time and for the next few days everyone was in shock and [trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=600s) to work out why two respected families would leave suddenly like that. They had relatives in Scotland and so they had, oh so they would have got the stories from somebody.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=608s)

They got the stories from somebody.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=610s)

The Bales family got the story straight from Aberdeen from, they had a family living in Saltcoats in Scotland. And so they got  information about what had happened. Then the Aberdeen notes got sent across to somebody and my dad was given a copy of those. I didn't know any of this at the time of course because it was all kept very secret because as you would know, if you mentioned anything like that you would get withdrawn from pretty much on the spot.

So over a period of about another month or so, there was discussion going on and clandestine sort of discussions and I could tell that my dad was having serious discussions with some [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=656s) brethren that he knew that he trusted but I had no idea what was about to happen. And on a Tuesday night after the ministry meeting, we got in the car and, of course, those of you who remember, I'm not sure how many of you remember those days, but the meetings were just full of references to the beloved. And for my dad, who was a deeply committed Christian, he was finding that difficult to understand why we would be talking about the beloved rather than the Lord Jesus. And as we drove away, dad said, that's it, I'm never going back. And he was 61\. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=702s) I passed that age a few years ago and I remember thinking when I did, can you imagine at the age of 61 walking away from everything that you've known all your life? What a huge change that would be, all of your family, all of your friends.

So I didn't believe him. I just thought, you know, dad's just having a bit of a spit. We went home and the next night was the Wednesday night reading meeting. And later that night, later the Tuesday night, my brother, my older brother Richard [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=738s) around to see dad and they had a long discussion and I remember Richard saying to dad, I'm going to leave as well. I can't stand this is, this is, this is nonsense. You know, you can't have the world leader being found in bed with another woman who's married and say that that's okay. I mean, you know, those things don't happen in a deeply committed Christian society where you have very highly principled [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=768s) obeying the morals that are set out in the bible.

So I was, I was somewhat staggered that Richard, Richard was married with three little children at that stage. And so the next night, the Wednesday night reading meeting, Richard said, I want to go back and I want to tell them why I'm leaving. And I was like, wow, this is going to be something. So my brother Jim and I said, we'll, we'll come along. Dad didn't go, he stuck to his principles. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=798s) didn't go. So Jim and I, we used to be the the techno guys. We used to operate the sound system, you know, those people that used to operate the microphone volumes and those sorts of things. That was our our job. Usually it was one person who did it, but on fellowship meetings or three-day meetings we'd have two. But that night that both of us went and sat at the booth because we sort of thought this might be something quite spectacular.

So the meeting went through and got to the end of it and I thought he's not [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=828s) to do it, you know. And then he picked up the, Richard picked up the microphone and he started to speak. And he, and he just gave this address which was sort of bizarre because it wasn't really part of the protocol and it just went in circles around and around about, you know, devotion to Jesus and how, you know, it's important that Jesus is the center of our attention. And I didn't even see where he was going for a while. And then all of a sudden he said, he, we declare ourselves [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=858s) assembly and I withdraw from iniquity. And I got, and he got up and and started walking out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=864s)

Wow.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=865s)

He recounted what had happened at Aberdeen in a very sort of a bleak way. He didn't give details, he just said that it had been iniquitous. And anyway, he withdrew from the whole assembly and got up and started to walk out. And as he was walking out, one of the other younger brothers who was sort of, you know, up and coming, grabbed a microphone and quickly withdrew from Richard as he was out the door. So withdraw was at 10 paces. And Richard was gone. And Jim and I was sitting there and [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=895s) just, we were just dumbfounded as you can imagine because our world just imploded.

And anyway, we packed up the microphone booth and we got up and and I went outside as quickly as possible to see whether Richard was still there because, you know, to say, you know, what are we going to do now? But he'd long gone. So Jim and I were standing out on the forecourt outside the the meeting room and you know how it is, usually everyone would come up and chat and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=926s) to you and that sort of thing. Well, there was a circle, I reckon about four or five meters in diameter and we were in the middle of it and everyone was just avoiding us, you know. And I thought, this is really odd, you know, I haven't done anything, what, I haven't changed, what, what's going on here? And then one of these serious young brothers came over to me and he said, so what are you going to do? And I said, I don't know, I suppose we're going to leave too. And he just turned and walked away without saying a [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=956s). And that was like the first inkling of what was about to happen.

And so we went home. And I think Dad and Mum, I didn't really think about it until we got home, but I think they were very relieved that we came home. Because you would know that, you know, in a lot of instances where something like that happened, the brethren would get hold of the children and stop them going back, even at age 17\. So we came home and we were just in shock at the change in our lives. And so from that point forward, dad rang Mr Bales, Harold Bales. And the next Saturday, Sunday morning, we went to their house and we had the breaking of bread at the 11 o'clock time that was the correct time in the early 1960s. I can see Bradley smiling. And we started our own [assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1016s), the true assembly in Adelaide, which was what we saw it as. We saw that as recovering the position and establishing the assembly for the Lord Jesus in Adelaide. And so there was three families. And then so we'd gone from a group of 500 to a group of, I think, 18\.

And that was our life for a period. But, of course, we were so convinced that we were right and that they had lost the way, that we did things like we obtained all the notes of the Aberdeen meetings, we photocopied them, we bought an old Gestetner machine and made a copy for every single family in Adelaide and then we delivered them to every single house in Adelaide. I think we posted them all at the same time at the general post office in the city and [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1073s) they all would have arrived at the same time in post boxes around Adelaide. And we found out that the first people who got them rang the leaders and then the leaders sent people around to everyone's houses to pull them out of the letterboxes and to try and prevent the story getting around. And then you know, we used to do things like we got the Aberdeen tapes and we used to ring people up and play them over the phone. And we were so convinced that this was the end of the brethren and you know, that that they were [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1103s) going to come and join us.

And that was our life for the next number of years. And then the next day I went to school. And of course at school, I don't know if you can remember, this is not the Brethren School, this is public school. There was no UBT in those days. So for my entire high school life, because I was in year 12, I was in the final year of just before you start university, supposedly start, which we weren't going to do of course. And there had been two other brethren boys [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1135s) our class all the way through. One of them was the the son of one of the high leaders and the other one was the son of a low socioeconomic family, I suppose. And they they walked up to me the next day and said, you know, what are you going to do? And I said, well, I think we're going to leave. And they walked and never spoke to me again.

And so you can imagine the school class what they would have thought because I had never, I didn't know anyone in our class because we weren't allowed to talk to them. And suddenly the two people with him I talked [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1165s) whole time didn't talk to me. So you know, it was a big transformation. And then we had to decide what I would do, you know, going forward from that. And I applied, I wanted to go to university to either do law or dentistry. And dad and mum didn't want that to happen because they were concerned that if I went to university, I might be corrupted by influences because you have to remember that my parents were still 100% [committed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1198s) to the brethren theology. They still thought that was absolutely the one and my dad never wavered from that right to his death, neither did my mum who died at 99 or something it was. So age 99 that is. So we we then sort of went through a period of wondering whether what JTJr had brought in particularly in the last few years was correct. You know, were [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1229s) things that because of the fact that he'd gone astray so violently or if you like, you know, obviously at Aberdeen, did that mean that he'd fallen into error in the last few years of the 60s?

And so we started to unravel things. And the first thing I think we decided was that maybe the the the idea that you couldn't associate with family members who had left the brethren was wrong. So it took us a long time, but my my uncle had been withdrawn from about seven years earlier and after some months my dad [reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1264s) out to him and so we started to resume relationships with with them. And then they joined our meeting and they and we ended up with what's called what's called the Web Oval brethren, which is like a, I suppose very like the Renton type brethren, in the sense that it was basically a reversion to the ministry pre-JT junior, I would say. And that was pretty much our life for the next few years. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1294s) that's a very quick introduction to the Aberdeen view from the Antipodes, Bradley. I know that you have a much more intimate involvement on your side of the world, but that's how it unfolded out here.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1312s)

What happened in the other sort of major localities like Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane?

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1317s)

Very few people left. It was, it was well managed, I would say. It was hushed up and so no one really found out what had happened. It was just kept quiet and and there was no, there was like maybe a handful of people left in Melbourne. I think there was a handful left in Sydney as well. But and I don't want to be, you know, I don't want to be rude about anyone or cast aspersions on anyone, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1348s) some people left because they didn't really have a 100% commitment to the brethren theology, if you like, I'll put it that way, the brethren way, the brethren teaching. And they saw Aberdeen as a as kind of like proof that they were right, I think. And that's why they left.

So those people quickly became what we would describe as worldly in the brethren. You know, they very quickly adapted to, you know, [following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1378s) a worldly way of life. Our family was very different to that. Our family was very, very cautious about and and the group we were with in Adelaide was very cautious. So every single decision was analyzed under the pretext of the bible and JT senior's ministry, you know, whether that was something that should be done or should not be done. So we were very conservative.

I suspect that some aspects of the brethren are very different today to what they were in the 1970s, particularly what I've, was late 60s, I should say, particularly what I've seen. But certainly the upheaval and the personal trauma that you would go through leaving would probably be much the same. And so it's not an easy decision to make. But all I can say is that I have never regretted it. And I have just had the best life. And really what I'd like to focus on more in what I talk about in this podcast is the opportunities and the things that I've been able to do that I would not have been able to do if I'd stayed in the brethren. I think, you know, I would have been like the cockatoo in the cage. And by now I probably would be so set in my ways that I would find it difficult to have enjoyed those things.

So so when I, I think I said to you dad and mum didn't want me to go to to university, but they did let me go to what was what was called [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1474s) South Australian Institute of Technology, which is a, which has now become a university by the way, but and to do an engineering degree. And so I went and did an engineering degree and I was a particular, you know, so naive and didn't really understand anything about the world. I'd never been inside a restaurant, I've never been and seen a film, I'd never seen a television set other than in a shop. And all of these things were very new and very different to me and it was a huge culture shock as it would be to anyone. And those things of course are the same, I presume today to some extent.

Anyway, I went and did [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1520s) engineering degree and I didn't do very well at first because I think I, I think that I was just ready to explore to find out what fishing was like, as in catching fish, camping, those sort of things which I'd never done. But then I settled down towards the latter part of the degree and started to do a bit of work and I did quite well. And then I got to the end of that degree and I got a [job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1551s) with one of the, with the largest telecom provider in Australia, was called Telecom Australia, then now called Telstra. And I worked there for a year or so. And then I went into the construction industry because my sister, I should say, by the way, there were six siblings in the family. Richard, my obviously left at the same time, my brother Jim is at the same time, my father and mother [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1581s) at the same time. The rest stayed in at that point.

So then my eldest sister, or second elder sister I should say, she was living in Victoria and they left about a year later. They had a building business and so I joined their building business when they came to Australia, South South Australia. And then I set up my own building business shortly after that and I had a very successful building business for about 20 years or so. And then in my 40s [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1611s) late 30s, I think I suppose you should say, I went through a period where I, I guess it was a reflection and thinking, what if I'd been allowed to go to university and study law like I really wanted to do? And so I'm gonna just talk about this period of sort of unsettledness I suppose in late 30s, which I think was about the time at which I started to rethink life and wonder whether [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1642s) should have been, it could have been different. And there were certain regrets, you know, you don't learn how to date people.

So for example, in that group of us that left, the 18 that left at that time, there was my brother Jim who was two years older than me, so he was 19, I was 17\. And there were two sisters who left, one was two years older than me and one was three or four years younger than me. And I remember we started to hear about other Christians outside who who were very devoted to, you know, to missionary work and to converting people to to the faith. And one of the families that left at about the same time as us was a [chap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1690s) called Robert Morton, who's a lovely gentleman, relative of ours. He had five young sons and he heard of someone called John Smith who was running something called the God Squad in in Melbourne.

Now the God Squad was a, it was a perhaps an offshoot of the hippie movement to some extent, where they were trying to convert bikies to Christianity. And, you know, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1721s) sort of enthusiastic chap and he was coming to speak at the Unley town hall, which is a town hall not far from where we lived. So I said to dad and mama, I'm going to go and listen to this chap preach. So I went to this hall and it was eight o'clock at night or something and I walked in and I was just staggered. There were all these young people there with their hands in the air praising God and and singing hymns. And I was like, hang on a minute, what's going on? There's 18 of us that know the truth [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1752s) here's hundreds of people, hundreds of people that are obviously really, you know, following the faith in love with Jesus and praising and worshiping him. And my goodness, didn't the girls look amazingly beautiful. I was just, really, really attractive young people.

And so eventually I, I thought I better go home. So I got home about 10:30 or something and I remember [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1782s) walked into the kitchen and I could tell as soon as I walked in that there was trouble. And and mum and dad were like, where have you been? And I was like, oh, you know, I went, went to this preaching and they were singing hymns and they were all praising God and there were lots of people there. And and dad was like, well, you go and get to bed and don't you go hanging around with people like that staying out all hours of the night, just behave yourself. And that's the last time you're doing that. And I remember [thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1812s), oh my goodness, you know, I'm, I am actually trapped in now in a smaller group than I thought.

So cut a long story short, my brother married one of those young sisters and I married the other because that was where we, we realized that was what our parents were going to insist on. And we were, you know, very obedient young boys. And so I suppose that was [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1843s) part the cause of some of the chagrin when I came to mid-30s, late 30s that I looked back and I thought, I wonder whether, you know, life could have been different. And I started to have kids by then, sorry, just yes, I did. I had, we married, we had four sons, beautiful boys who are now are all grown up of course with their own kids and on the grand path four or five [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1873s), five times over now. And so I started to explore if you like, what might have been. And one of those things was I, because of my brethren upbringing, I'd never even learned to swim, you know, never been to the beach, I didn't know how to swim.

And I had an accident in my building business where I dislocated my shoulder quite badly. And then I had [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1903s) have a reconstruction on my shoulder and I could hardly move my right arm, which, you know, I can move fine now by the way. And I said to the doctor at the end of it, how, how can I best rehabilitate myself? And he said, well, if you just go swimming, that would be really good. And I couldn't say to him, I don't know how to swim, you know, in my 30s and I've never been a swimmer. But I went and learned to swim and I really devoted myself to it and I became quite a good swimmer and it actually fixed my arm. But [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1933s) a result of learning to swim, then I thought, I think I'll learn to dive. So then I learned to scuba dive. And then I became very keen on scuba diving and boating and I got really enthusiastic about all that sort of life. And I finished up being a master scuba instructor and teaching other people to dive.

And as a result of that, you know, got into photography, very passionate about underwater photography. And [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1963s) and then when you're doing scuba instructing, usually you work for a particular shop that sells scuba gear and they they said to me, you know, you're a very good instructor, we love what you're doing, but we'd like you to be selling more gear to the students, more, you know, scuba tanks and wetsuits and all that sort of stuff. So we want you to go to a seminar. So I went to this motivational seminar with this American chap was speaking. I'd never been to anything like this before. And he said to the [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=1994s) the group of us, said, I want you to pull out a piece of blank paper and I want you to write on it, what would you like to be in 10 years time if you, if you had a, if you had a blank slate and you could just decide today, in 10 years time I will be X, you write down what X is.

And I remember thinking about it and I thought, you know what, I'd like to be a lawyer. I think I'd like to be a lawyer. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2024s) I just wrote down, I'd like to be a lawyer. And he said, and he said, right, have you all written that down? And he said, yeah, yeah. He said, okay, so that's in 10 years time. He said, so if, if if you were going to achieve that goal in 10 years time, what would you have done say in five years time? And I was like, oh, I don't know, probably would have done a law degree, I suppose. And so I said, I would have done a law degree. I said, okay, so [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2055s) you were to get a law degree in five years time, what would you be doing in say one year's time? Well, I'd be studying law, you know. Okay, so if you'd be studying law in one year's time, what would you doing in one month's time? And then he brought it back to one week. And then he said, now I want you to write down, you know, not just your career, I want you to write down, you know, your personal goals as well, you know, your family goal, your spiritual goal, your society goal and your career goal.

So you divide it up into [four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2085s) things. And I've shortcut, I haven't gone into all those details, but one of those things for example, of course was in terms of the spiritual goal was I wanted to be able to explain to people what I believe and why I believe it. And I found that a really difficult goal to set and and to extend, but I did and I, I have worked on, and I'll come back to that shortly. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2115s) in terms of the law one, and and here's another another really good lesson that he taught me, I think, is once you set that goal and you say what you're going to have to achieve say next week to to get the month goal, to get the year goal, to get etc, you get to the end of the week and if you haven't done it, have a look at what you wrote down and you look at what you wrote down, you say, do I really want to do that? Do I, is it, is I, do I want do that? Well, then next week, do it.

And so for me in, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2145s) going back to the law thing now, for me when I, when I got to the end of the first week, I thought, I haven't actually done anything. Do I really want to do this? I actually do. So I went and filled out an application form for a university to go at age, you know, with running a business with four sons, and to to go back to uni. And I got knocked back several times because my engineering results weren't very good. And I had to do [aptitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2175s) tests and all those sort of things, I think. And eventually I got into an interview panel and they interviewed me and and they said, you know, how many hours a week can you devote to your law degree? And I thought, I've got a pretty busy life, but I can devote, I decided I could devote 15 hours a week to it. And I got rejected because they said, oh, you know, we don't think you're taking it seriously enough. You'll need to go and do another degree first and when you do that, then we'll look at letting you into law.

So but because I'd [set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2205s) that out in paper and because I was committed to the process, I did. I went and enrolled in a different degree and I worked hard on that and I did well and I got into law. And you know, that was what was I, 40, age 43 I think when I got into law. And I loved it, you know, as soon as I got into it, it was just like a breath of fresh air of, you know, this is what I should have done first time around. And I've done quite well at it to be, [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2236s) be, you know, not without sort of blowing my own trumpet about it, I've done quite a lot. Now sitting in an office in my own law firm. So that's incredible. So I, all I'm gonna, and that's not because I'm special or anything, it's simply, it's simply because I decided to go out and get something that is available and you don't have to be particularly smart to do these things, you just have to have the persistence and want to do it. But it would never have happened if I'd stayed in there of course.

Because that, those chaps that were my colleagues in 1970, like one of them, I'm not going to mention their names, but one of them is actually the leader in Adelaide or has been the leader from time to time in Adelaide. And would you know, would you want to be the leader of the brethren in Adelaide? Seriously, no, you know, I mean, how constrictive would that be, you know, to have a life like that? The things that I've been able to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2300s), unbelievable. Anyway, so as a result of the scuba diving thing, I think that really opened the door to to me changing to a new career and becoming a lawyer. And then traveling the world, I traveled all over the world scuba diving, you know, took photographs in all sort of countries all around the world and I've just enjoyed the most, you know, interesting life.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2330s) I suppose, I suppose that the big question that people would ask is, what about the people you had to leave behind? What about those you left behind? And sure, that is, you know, that is a sad part of my life. So you know, when I left in 1970, I think my grandmother had died about a year or two earlier, I think 68 or 69\. And she had 150 direct descendants.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2360s)

Wow.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2361s)

When she died, and of those 150, I think perhaps 5 or 10 might have left over the years. So the vast majority of my family is still inside, including my oldest brother who sadly is now, as he would say, gone to be with the Lord. And I'm going to just talk about that for a moment because it's a particularly, it's a poignant story, really. So when I, in 19, sorry, in 2001, I think it was, so this is about 30 years after we left. And because of the fact that when we left, we were quite confident that we were following the truth and that the Brethren, once they found out about Aberdeen, would realise and change their ways, I'd always maintained the likelihood that we would all be back together again.

But of course as it turned out, JTJr went and died only two weeks, I think about two weeks after we left. And I think there were a lot of people, and Bradley, this is going back to your point about what happened in other cities, I think there were a lot of people in Australia who were very troubled by Aberdeen and were thinking about leaving. And I know my dad talked to numerous people before he left who were going to leave [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2451s) well and they were just weren't, they were like, give it a week or two, we'll just see what happens. And then of course when he died, I think they thought, right, it's going to come back to normal now. We'll, we'll restore the truth again now that that little, you know, obviously they would not, no one would say it publicly that JTJr was an alcoholic and had led the brethren astray, but I suspect that's what they were thinking inside without saying it.

So in around about 2001 is the first time that I thought, do you know what, I hadn't spoken to my brother since 1970\. I think I did actually go and I'd keep going knock on his door when I got married and and we got a very unfriendly reception. But I thought, do you know what, I'm going to ring him on his birthday. So I rang [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2504s), I found out his telephone number and those days of course they weren't mobiles, it was all landlines. And I rang his work number because I knew, I knew the name of his business and they said, oh, he's not here, he's at home. So I didn't say who I was, but then I rang the home and it was engaged. So I knew that someone worked out who it was that had rung and probably recognized the voice maybe. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2534s) when I, when he picked up the phone, he already knew it was going to be me. And I said, Peter, you know, haven't talked to you for nearly 30 years, I'm just ringing up to wish you a happy birthday.

And he, he was almost silent, he hardly said a word. And I chatted for a minute and I said, you know, about the fact that I got married, four sons, successful business, having a great life, etc. And then he still wasn't responding. And I said, Peter, it's 30 years since we've talked to each other. Haven't you got anything else to say about what's happened in your life? What's happening in your life? And he said a couple of things about his family. He said, oh, I've got a lovely family or something like that. But then it was just silence. And then he said, Tom, you made the decision as to what you wanted to do. You've made your choice, I don't think we have anything to talk about.

So I thought about that for a few days and then I thought, you know what, I'm going to write to him. So I wrote to him and I said, you've said that I made my choice. You need to remember that I was 17, I didn't actually make any choice. My parents made the choice, dad and mum made the choice. I left, I'm an evidence-based case person, [particularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2616s) now that I'm at this stage of my life because by then I was a lawyer. I'd like you to tell me the facts about Aberdeen and if you've got a story about Aberdeen that's different to what I've heard because I always believe in getting both sides of a story. One of the things you learn as a lawyer is there's always two sides to the story. You tell me what the story is that you've got.

And I got back a letter which was just bizarre. It took two months, but basically it was a letter that came back that said, as to Aberdeen, the facts are the facts. Let me just see if I've got his letter here, I'll see if I can find it. You see it, yeah. So I've got the letter here. I mean, I, I probably, it wouldn't probably be [appropriate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2668s) to to put it publicly on the screen given that it's a personal letter from him even though he's now no longer with us. But but he just says, regarding Aberdeen, there isn't any more to tell as to facts, capital, capital FACTS, other than what was clearly stated by Mr J Taylor Jr in his letter which was circulated under his direction at the time. So basically he's going back to the to the letter I knew those letters we've all seen now. And then he goes on to say, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2698s) was supposition and imputation added to it with falsehoods and you can't accept anything against an elder unless there's two or three witnesses.

But then he goes on to say there was a build-up and Mr Taylor's provocative speaking leading up to this ambush caused the bringing into the open of the secret reserves against the purity of our beloved brother and unfaithfulness to the Lord. Now you know, I, I have cross-examined a number of people in in court [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2729s) I wanted to cross-examine him about that letter, but I just couldn't do it. I wrote a reply and then I never even sent it because it's such a pathetic attempt. Why would you talk about warning of an ambush coming? That's just the complete contradiction to an ambush. And the concept of it being an ambush is just ridiculous. You know, clearly what happened is the man became addicted to alcohol, [lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2759s) his sense of judgment and and presumably fell in love with a woman and you know, took advantage of his position of power, you know.

And and you know, those sort of things happen in the wider society quite frequently, but they're not appropriate for a, what I'll call a church which supposedly follows the moral principles that are set out in the bible. And so it was just clearly wrong. And he concluded his letter by saying, if we see, if I seriously wish to reconsider the course, then he'd be glad to communicate further. So [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2802s), you know, to me that was a very strange response. The letter in itself has a number of internal inconsistencies and I just thought, I'm just going to leave that where it is. But just to finish on that, a number of years later, I think about three or four years later, I'm not sure the exact timing of this, there was a news report about a young boy being killed in an accident and it sounded very [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2832s) like it might have been an accident that occurred at his, my brother's workplace.

So I called him up because I thought it was very likely his grandson who died because  what happened was he had a machinery business and he and a six year old boy had climbed inside a machine and no one had known he was there and then it crushed him to death. That's as I understand the report. So I feel [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2863s) sorry for him, you know, if something like that had happened at his workplace, it's a terrible accident to happen. And I rang him up to express and I said, I just wanted to ring you up and say, I'm really sorry to hear about that and I realized what it, you know, how difficult that must be for you and your family. And he's, you know, was, I think he might have said thank you, I think, but he didn't say anything else much. We chatted for perhaps a minute or two and then about a [month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2893s) later I got a phone call from his oldest son saying that he died. And, you know, a couple of weeks, like two weeks after our phone call. And I said, really? So now I was only, I, I rang him only a month ago, you know, this must have been quite sudden.

And he said, no, no, he had asbestosis. So when I spoke to him, he was right, right close to death. Wow, never [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2923s) mentioned that he was ill. And I was just devastated, you know, it would have been so nice to have been able to say thank you for being a good brother, etc, and say goodbye. But that's the harshness of the of a system that, you know, puts around people in in this way. It comes back to what you were saying about emotions, Cheryl, as well. Well, we were talking about emotions and just how, you know, they just can't express [emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2953s) and it isn't the thing to do. They just have to, you know, stiff up a lip and just exactly. Sorry, what was that, Bradley?

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2965s)

Particularly with family.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=2967s)

Yeah, so more so than other people. We have since that time, I suppose, and at about that time, because I, I've, my marriage, my first marriage eventually didn't last. And you know, and I, I'm, you know, would fully accept responsibility for that on my side because I, as I said, you know, never having dated, etc, I, I felt madly and deeply in love with somebody and etc. And I'm not going to go into those details. But [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3007s) I do have, I did remarry and then I have a beautiful daughter. And when she was born, of course, by that stage, there were no restrictions, you know, and I, and I had this photograph of her sitting on a park bench with six of her friends from kindergarten when we'd been to the local park or something.

And they were all [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3037s) know, sitting together and I remember that just triggered something in my mind thinking that is something I will never have, you know, because all of my compatriot people that I grew up with are no longer part of my life. And I, and I went through what I would call in my, probably in my around about my 50s, I suppose, an episode of PTSD for a while where I was [mystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3068s) if you like, as to why I would suddenly burst into tears. I had no idea. I mean, I'm a successful lawyer, I'd be driving down the road and I just burst into tears. And I was, and so I finished up, finished having a therapy for them and a lovely psychologist eventually said to me one day, do you know, Tom, I think there's a part of you that wishes you'd never left.

And I initially was quite dismissive about that. I thought, that's rubbish, you know, I, I have no regrets about leaving whatsoever. And then she said to me, well, what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to bring that out into the open in your mind and so write down, write a letter to yourself [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3118s) as that 17 year old. The first letter is why you should have stayed and the second letter is why you should have left. And I, I took me a couple of weeks to to decide to do it, to actually do what she said because I thought it sounded a ridiculous idea. But I did it. And the odd thing is that when I started to write the letter about why I should have stayed, I just fell into brethren speaking about an instant and I could come [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3148s) with all these catch phrases as to, you know, implanted deep in my psyche is all this stuff about, you know, following the truth and you know, of not losing the way and holding the, holding on and etc, etc.

And I got to the end of, I thought, what a load of rubbish, you know, why is that actually bothering me? This is just so wrong. And then when I wrote the other letter about why I should have left, it was so clear and it was a really good cleansing process for me [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3179s) to confront that and to realize that. And I suspect this is the same for people who who don't actually make the decision to leave themselves, but their parents ask them or take them to leave.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3190s)

Yeah, or people who are pushed out. Like I'm actually going to do this exercise because what what a cleansing exercise when you felt like you didn't have a choice. I mean, we know on the outside, we know that we value the freedom we have now, but I agree that when you don't have a choice, whether you're forced out or your parents make that choice, there's a part of us that is stuck back there in absolute hiatus.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3217s)

Yeah, yeah. And and and there is this thing, you know, where if if you're a committed and absolutely rule following person that's prepared to turn the corner when the Lord turns a corner and follow the cloud or whatever language you want to talk about, and do everything the brethren says on the inside and you and you don't actually care about having a life, let's put it that way, you do have a cradle to the grave social blanket [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3247s) you that looks after you. I mean, there is no doubt about the fact that the payoff for not having a life is that you do get this umbrella of care. And I'm not sure whether it applies so much today, I don't know. But certainly, you know, I'll give you an example.

When I was 16, I, we in Australia you get your driving license when you're 16 and I was 16 years and three months old. And I had my license [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3278s) I had a very, very serious car accident. And, you know, came through the light, the traffic lights were green and as I came through the traffic lights, I saw this sporty vehicle coming at high speed through a red light, almost a head-on accident. I hit the seat belt so hard that I had bleeding from the seat belt and and my mother who was sitting next to me in the car was thrown out of the vehicle. And this is before we left. And and she was, she was, you know, I think she had a broken leg and a head injury and and you know, the ambulance came, the sirens blaring and took her to hospital, etc.

But as you would know in the brethren, people only stay in hospital when they absolutely have to because of the eating matter, because you're not allowed to eat with others. So the brethren safety net stepped in and she was taken from [hospital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3348s) the next morning to stay in, those days one of the leading brothers was a doctor and stayed in his house and cared for and the brethren safety net just came around our family in a most, in a lovely way. There is no doubt about that. And when you're inside of course, you think that that would be my safety net and no one else could provide that. But that's not the case at all. And and I remember the first time I realized that was actually when I was, I began [scuba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3378s) diving. I remember sitting on a beach, you have to remember that it took me 20 years really to change my brethren mentality. I was probably in my late 30s by this stage. And until then, I pretty much slavishly followed most of the brethren rules, say pre-JT junior rules anyway.

I remember sitting on a beach with these chaps that, that we're all, we were doing our dive master training where you do all these [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3408s) of very difficult exercises where you have to, you know, swim long distances against weights and currents and all that sort of thing. And these chaps were talking and one of them said, oh, you know, I've got to move house on the weekend. And they all said, oh, you know, we'll come around and help it. And and I suddenly realized that in the wider community outside the brethren, there is actually a genuine sense of love and caring and affection in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3438s) normal psyche of a human is to care for each other. That's what humans are like. They do that. Yeah. And and there is, you can build a group very quickly just by being a caring individual, but you'll attract caring individuals. So the fact that the brethren provide that sort of a net is not at all unique. But if you, if you stay in the brethren to keep that, you'll never have a life. Would you? 

And just just jump in quickly, that's I think, I mean, I've not had much personal experience of it, but the, I think often like sports clubs and other other kind of clubs, you often get a kind of similar kind of sense of community, yes, in those in those groups, don't you? And people looking out for each other. So it's just something, you know, people to be aware of. Yeah, that's right. And there are so many different groups like that that are [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3495s) open to people to belong to. And and and you know, I've now, I've got a group around me in my own law firm that, you know, that care about me and and I've got a, you know, a family, a community where we live. We, my wife and I live on a beautiful farm in the Adelaide Hills and you know, and our neighbors are just marvelous. They're just wonderful people, you know, and we can, if anything [happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3525s), we can just call on the phone and they'll be there in 30 seconds, you know. My wife had a medical episode a few months ago and you know, the neighbors up the road are doctors, you know, and they were there within a minute, you know. And you know, they would do anything for us. So the this community thing which because you're in the brethren, you're cut off from society, you think is entirely brethren driven, it's not at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3552s)

Yeah.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3552s)

There are wide nets outside that care for people as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3557s)

I experienced it when my husband, he had a heart attack and had to have an artificial heart while we're waiting for a heart transplant. And I had the community all over our city came to us. There was an article written about him. Like it's it, don't, I, I hope those insiders that are listening to this really take it to heart that this is everywhere. It's not just within within the PBCC and that that that blanket of love can come from [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3587s) follow your passion when you just get involved in, I mean, it can come from going to a pottery class, right? It can, it just naturally humans want to do that. They want to be to connect, they want to be together, they want to be connected.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3598s)

That's right, absolutely. And the other thing which I, I was slightly hesitant to talk about this aspect, I went through a phase with my building company where which was very successful and I was getting close to ready to retire at about age 40\. And what I intended to do was to become a full-time pastor in a church on a volunteer basis, basically convert, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3629s) know, attempting to persuade people to become Christians. And leading, you know, following the truth as I understood it to be at that stage. And I decided to go and study theology.

So I went and did a theology degree. And that was a really interesting part of my life because I was deeply involved in that church community, which is another example of what the safety net that you would have in the brethren, in a church community. And they were lovely, lovely people who cared and operated as one big family, but a much, I have to say, a [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3674s) closer family than the brethren family. You know, we would have meals together, very similar to the brethren entertaining, but there's no pressure to do it in a certain way or anything. It's just all very relaxed and so on.

And, you know, I went through a whole period where I was, you know, a leader in a church involved in evangelism and preaching and and so on, really a replacement if you like of the brethren community. And they're everywhere. So so it's not only in sporting [communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3707s), it's also in church communities. And so it really you can choose once you're outside the brethren, you can choose which way you want to go. If you want to go down one of those places, totally welcoming to you.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3722s)

Or do multiple. You can be involved in a church and in a sporting community.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3726s)

Absolutely correct. And what was at that time, exactly right. I was at that time, I had at a, you know, a big dive boat and and involved in a sporting diving club and and at the same time, used to take the youth group from the church out on the same boat, you know, so.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3744s)

Yeah, the thing in reflecting back on it about being inside was the the conditionality of the relationships. Everything was conditional. And and secondarily, everything was subject to somebody saying it was okay or not okay. Like you couldn't just go and visit someone, you couldn't do this, you couldn't do that because someone had to approve it. And everything was all based on, you know, this, these, it was all conditional. Whereas outside, people just care about you because they care about [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3774s) or you know, it's a...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3776s)

Really good point. That is a really good point is that it is, you have to like everybody in there, right? If you don't, you can't get away from them. We're out here, you get to choose, you get to choose that blanket of love that we've talked about.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3790s)

In that, in your embrace and in and efolded by people just for being you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3795s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3796s)

Yes, it's not because you're a member of a church or a sporting group or something. There's people that just like you or care about you or your neighbor, like neighbors like you mentioned, Tom, you know, it's about, it's about the goodness inside of people, you know, it's, it's not like on the inside we didn't know that.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3816s)

It's just, it's more genuine really then, isn't it? It's not forced, it's real. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. That's a really good point, Paul, because inside, you know, you're told who you can be friends with, you know, there is a limitation and you can't be friends with anyone outside the brethren obviously. But but not only that, as I understand it, particularly nowadays, and there's limitations on who you're allowed to entertain and etc, and limitations on who you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3846s) marry and all those sorts of strange rules.

One of the things that really struck me, I've just yesterday received my copy of Craig Hoyle's book and I haven't, I haven't yet had the opportunity to read more than about a page or so. But one of the things that really struck me about Craig's story is that he fully believed that Bruce Hales would be able to do sort of miraculous things for him. And somebody else I read of recently that said, you know, that Bruce apparently says that he can, he can look at you and in five [seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3887s) can work out what, what's inside your soul or something like that. What a, what a ridiculous set of propositions, you know, this is, this is a very flawed human, you know, this is a very flawed human.

And to think that that would somehow or other give him the power to do these things to you know, to change a person from being homosexual to straight, very strange group of people that you're forced to associate with. Whereas outside, there is no such constriction on that. If you were to meet someone who made those sort of claims outside, you would just think they were really odd and walk away and be friends with someone else.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3933s)

Yeah, yeah. The other thing is is they talk so much about the work of God in you, you know, not quenching the spirit's work of God, not quenching the work of God in you and embracing that. But the whole practice is a denial of it. And you know, looking back on sort of my priestly visits, that was one of the things I said is like, if you believe God is omnipotent, and they're like, oh yes, yeah, just definitely, definitely unlimited. Well, if you feel that God, you know, everything God is doing, no, no, no, we couldn't, you know, couldn't embrace the breadth... Well, how can you say then that God isn't working in me differently than he's working in you? Yes. And it was just this kind of weird mumbling and grumbling and just kind of brushed by that very quickly. But you know, if you are a Christian, you believe, then you realize you can't put [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3987s) structures or those sort of boundaries on. Yes.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=3991s)

There's one topic that I would like to point out for people who might be listening to this. The concept of a, a religion which stays fairly stable over a long period of time really arises largely because of the text that follows. And I'm speaking now, I'm not speaking just about Christianity here, I'm speaking like, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4021s), Islam for example has the Quran, Christianity has the bible. Now I remember one of the seminal changes that occurred in 1970 was the very first time it was said that; “What Jim Taylor says is equal in importance to the Bible.” Now, and as I understand it, that's become a very clearly accepted truth now that, you know, what Bruce says, his interpretation, obviously it's always in his language based on an interpretation of the Bible.

But what he says about that interpretation is the final version of it. That automatically leads to instability and unpredictability about the future because as soon as you say we are not going to follow the textbook that has been the textbook for 1500, 2000 years for Christianity, we're now going to allow an individual to decide [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4091s) is right and what is wrong, you, you aren't going to maintain a cohesive direction. You're going to be wandering in all sorts of directions if you do that. And I think that's a, it's a huge change that has occurred since 1970, since that first edict came out about the words of the Beloved are of equal importance to the biblical text. And whatever you might think about, you know, the authority of the Bible as the Word of God, the fact is that as soon as you say it's up to Bruce to decide what we do, then who knows where you're going to go next? You can so easily end up with a Jim Jones type.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4140s)

100%, yeah. And I think that's what he's created. He's created for himself the exact, the exact replica of that of where he has all these people underneath his thumb that, I mean, those that don't see through it totally believe, absolutely believe that that he, he's the Paul, he's Paul, right? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4165s)

No, what you were saying about that under JTJr, I mean, under JT ministered about “revealed light in the temple” being equivalent to scripture. But that was, I think that set the stage for it, but that was more of a community sort of thing. And then it evolved from that into, you know, the big cheese saying what's up.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4191s)

Yeah, that's an interesting point because I, I mean, I have my own views about the whole concept that Darby started with in terms of, you know, his interpretations of separation from evil and so on. I think to me that was the, if you like, the seed which has caused things to become poisoned. Yeah, because you've cloistered yourself [away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4221s) from the mainstream common sense of Christianity, which in effect, Christianity really is a set of morals that have been laid down through the biblical text. And as soon as you say, we're going to separate ourselves from everyone else and have our own little version of it, well then you start that process and you can then get to the point which the second stage is what you say where we have the “revealed light in the temple” and the third one is the leader at the top [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4252s) what goes.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4252s)

Yeah, yeah. I, I really do, I really come to a strong sense even in the last couple of years that it really was faulty at the foundation. I mean, what it has become is a far cry from what JND envisioned, but the theology was faulty, I believe, just fundamentally, which allowed for this to grow into what it is. I mean, but the fruit, the fruits, you know,  [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4283s) a sign of what the tree is, you know.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4286s)

Yeah, look, it's probably beyond the scope of where we want to go in this discussion because I suspect that we could have a very interesting deep and detailed theological discussion about those aspects of it. But all I can tell, all I'll say is this, that when I went and studied theology and I did various very fascinating subjects, the exegesis of the Old Testament and the history of the New Testament and the way in which the biblical text was formed, et cetera, you just come to a realisation that really the brethren's understanding and they have this mistaken view that they know more about it than anybody else. But you very quickly realize that they actually know a lot less than most and they don't actually have very much of a large picture understanding of what the whole thing is about. But when you're inside of course, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4348s) can't, you can't reach that view.

I just want to talk, Cheryl, about the trapping aspect of it because my brother Richard, who, you know, I'm sadly no longer with us, would you believe due to asbestosis, I've lost two brothers to the same, to the same condition. When my brother Richard left, he was in a very similar position, I suspect, to most where he had a [mortgage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4378s) on his house owed to other brethren. So their house, you know, instead of borrowing money from a bank, money borrowed from senior brethren. And of course, as soon as you leave, they call it in, you know, because the mortgage is available at call. But you know, in the way that life turns, what happened was the amount of his mortgage within a few weeks of him finding out he was going to get his mortgage called, his neighbor called him up and said, we would like to buy some of your backyard.

And they actually paid out his mortgage by buying a small portion of his backyard. Now, you know, you can put whatever context you like around that and I, I'm, I'm easy with any interpretation or reason or motivation you like to put around it. But it just shows that you don't limit yourself, don't, don't think I can't do it because of X. There are always ways around it. There are always [ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4448s) around it. And whether you look at it as a God provided for him or whether you look at it as though that is just because he took an opportunity that presented itself, I don't mind which way you look at it. I'm not going to try and say either way works.

And I'm going to tell another poignant story about my brother Richard for you. So after he left, he had a, he and his wife Jenny had, he had another son, Charles. And when he was 20 months old, he became ill. He was perfectly fine, healthy, 20 months old little boy, curly white hair, chatting, walking, you could not have faulted a thing. And one Sunday night, we went to the gospel meeting as we used to do. And when we picked him up, he actually slept in the cot in my bedroom in my parents' house and they were picking up to take him home. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4513s) he coughed and we thought, that's a little bit unusual. And then within five days, he was gone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4519s)

Oh, wow.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4520s)

And of course you would know what was said about that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4527s)

Yeah.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4527s)

But then fast forward to the other story that I mentioned to you more recent that happened some years later where my other brother's grandson was killed in an accident and nobody, nobody is from our side, from the outside the brethren is going to attribute that to God's justice or wrath or whatever. It's a tragic accident, it's what happens in life, things go wrong in life. There are [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4557s) that go wrong in life. So you can't expect if you leave that you will never have a problem. There will be issues, but it's not God's just judgment. That's not how God works.

And it's just so wrong to attribute those things to some sort of vendetta or attributive justice as a result. And I just wanted to make that point because [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4588s) all know of people who have left who've had tragic things happen or great things happen. And when they happen inside the brethren, such as happens to people inside as well, then it's what's called vicarious suffering. So it's suffering imposed upon them by somebody to make up for others' transgressions. Well, that's just nonsense. It really is nonsense and it needs to be called for what it is.

**Paul Flowerdew**

 And on the flip side of that, they never [admit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4619s) that anyone such as yourself who's had a successful life. You know, they don't say, oh, well, that's, that's God's blessing, do they? I mean, logically, if they're to say that something bad happening is God's judgment, then they're bound to admit that the converse is true as well, surely?

**Tom Grace**

Yeah, exactly, exactly right. And and you know, I in my own experience where, you know, I've had [such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4649s) an interesting and fulfilled life, I don't attribute that to, you know, God blessing me because I left. That's not, not at all what I'm saying. All I'm saying is if if you make the decision to leave, you've got choices. Yeah, one of those choices is to do the sort of things that you want to do.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4672s)

Yeah, and I think that what both of you are saying is, you know, the whole sort of thing going back to JND is predicated on the negative and it's predicated on judgment over love or judgment over mercy. Like there is, it's all, but it's all the negative. It's, you know, have to separate from, you know, this is God's judgment on this, it's not really focused on the love. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4702s) mean, as a Christian, the love that's seen in Christ, you know, that's, that's the message of the gospel. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4710s)

I think to, like what I struggled with after I left, I also left at 17, is I didn't know how to make choices, right? Like I left and then there's this wide world and I do know that this is something we struggle when we talk to some of the insiders that are still in there is they simply don't know how to make a choice. It's because you've never, you've had everything made, made, all your decisions are made for you. You follow regime, you are [indoctrinated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4741s) to be this robotical human for the leader. And once you leave, it's hard. It's hard to even know if I had to work through therapy on how to make choices.

So what my, what I would give an offer for the insiders that are listening to this again is it's like trying on clothes. You just have to do things. You've got to rebuild your trust in your own human instinct and in your, when you get [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4771s) here, you're going to know what to do. You'll know what to do. And just like Tom said, it's like those, those experiences come to you, the people come to you, the jobs come to you, it literally comes to you. Your job is just to take that leap of faith and fly out of the cage. I will promise you there are so many of us out here and we all help each other in making choices. But I do know that that is an issue more so now than maybe [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4801s) when I left or when you even left, Tom, is that it's hard for them to even know if they're making choices. They're very, very brainwashed in there now.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4811s)

Yeah, and I think it's really important building on that, Cheryl, is that again, if we're speaking in a Christian context, you know, the work of God is different in every person in the way one you might experience the Christian faith is different than I might.

How we express it and trying things on and working in different or attending or going, being a part of different groups and you find where you connect with God or where you can feel this synergy is important. I think it really is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4843s)

Yeah. And I mean, that first step out, right? It is very, especially when you've been in a faith based community, that it is just, it is so important to try on what fits you. I have tried on so many different things, so many different things. I tried on Catholicism. I tried on the the United Church. I tried on so many different churches. I tried on different spiritual modalities. I've tried on everything. And you know what I've come back to at age 40? [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4873s) don't even know how old I am. 48, 49\. I'm not sure what I am. I think I'm 49\.

What I've come back to is due to the trauma and stuff that I've experienced, my faith has led me back to myself. That it comes back to me getting back inside everything that I've experienced and learning how to have that trust within myself. Do I have trust within my choices? Do I have trust within who is around me? Do I have, it's, it's really we've got to come back to that solid [faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4909s) and trust in yourself. And then once you get to figure that out, you can, when you try on other things, it is much easier. You can really find what fits you.

But like, I've been out 30 years, and I'm just really learning how to do this now only because I've just really dove in to some of the most deepest trauma that I've gone through. Up until now, it's just this constant trying on, trying on, nothing really fit, nothing doesn't feel right. And so the more that I have dove into what really [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4939s) happened to me in there , the more that I'm finally feeling content with myself. And I mean, I do a lot of healing on this podcast. It is very, very therapeutic for me when I come in on here and we connect together. To me, it fills my bucket and the wounds of my soul more than anything that I can put words to. And so I think it's important with the abundance of opportunities and choices that we have in the world, you got to learn how to just try things on and [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4969s) are when you make your choices, right? Find people that you connect with. You're, you'll find a lot of people that you have a special kinship with out here.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=4980s)

That's exactly right. Can I, can I talk about one anecdote? When we left, as I've already said, you know, we were very, very adherent to rules, etc. And so I had never heard any music other than brethren singing hymns. And never, never heard a radio, never heard a pre-recorded music or anything like that. A year or two [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5010s) we left, my brother Richard said, I'm gonna buy a record player, which in those days was a, you know, there were no CDs in those days. And so he bought an HMV 8 plus 8, which is a fairly basic stereo. And I, I get a bit emotional talking about this because it introduced me to one of the greatest loves of my life.

And he rang up and I remember saying, it's been delivered, why don't you come around and have a look? So he went around and there sitting in his lounge room was this, you know, stereo had a radio. And he had a, you know, a 33 LP record by a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5059s) called Joel and LaBreeska Hemphill. And he said, have a listen to this. And he put it on and I, last night in thinking about this, I could still remember the words of the very first song that I ever heard. And it was,

“Lord, I give myself to thee, heart and soul and all of me, make me what I ought to be. I'm willing, Lord, willing, Lord, to take thy word to foreign soil or spend a life at home with thee.”

 And remember hearing that song played and just thinking, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5110s) possibly could be wrong about that? That is, you know, that is like the gospel message of Christianity encapsulated in the most beautiful country. It was country and western music, I'm sorry to have to say.

And I have moved on in my taste a little bit since then, but I still go back to that moment of the Hawaiian guitar and the drums and this deep South American voice. And I, what that started in my life was just this passion for high quality stereo music which, which I, those of those who know me would know that I have the most ridiculous hi-fi system and have a massive collection of music of all sorts. And it is just a beautiful, beautiful thing to have really good quality music. And if you're the sort of person who maintains that the creation is God's doing, which I fully accept, that is part of it. That is part of it. And, you know, music is a beautiful thing and don't, don't be limited in what you listen to or be told what you shouldn't listen to, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5193s) enjoy it, choose to enjoy it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5197s)

What do you think, I mean, you've obviously been watching all the podcasts. What do you think it will take for change to happen in there? There's many, many people that are waiting for what they call a second Aberdeen. I don't think it's going to happen the way that Aberdeen happened. It's not, I just don't believe in that. But what do you think it will take for either an opening for people to leave or things to shift in there in your opinion?

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5229s)

See, it's a difficult question to answer. I know when we left in 1970, we developed a thesis, if you like, that about every 10 years there was a crisis. And we were sort of predicting that there would be one roughly every 10 years coming on and one of those would be so significant that it would result in the disintegration of it. But here we are, you know, 50 years later and it still hasn't happened. I'm not sure that it will disintegrate. I'm not sure that it will. I feel like now it's become this self-fulfilling monolith which people are so, I mean, why would Bruce let it disintegrate? Why wouldn't he simply keep the control, keep the financial control over it, keep the personal control over it and modify a little bit here and there? I really think if you're going to wait until it disintegrates, you're probably never going to leave.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5289s)

And it comes down to knowing that you have a choice, right? And even though that choice is scary, you've got to ask. There's just so many people with one foot in, one foot out, just waiting for some moment to open up. And I understand that. I completely understand wanting a door to open for you. But sometimes we have to put our hand on that handle and open the door for ourselves. And to me, in my personal opinion, I think that's [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5319s) the change is going to happen, is that it's each individual person has to learn how to stand up and pursue what they know that they deserve.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5329s)

Yeah, I totally agree with that. I think each person is in control of their own lives and although it might be daunting and it might be very confronting to to think about it, there are steps that you can take which, and I, I don't remember which podcast it was, but I think there was a recent podcast where someone was suggesting, I mean, you can go to a service station and buy yourself [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5360s) we would call a burner phone and get yourself access to the outside world so much easier now than you could when we were when we were young. And you get that access and then you start to find out, you know, what is actually happening out there. And you'll find out that you're being sold a lie, that it's not the truth, that this is the beginning and end of the world inside the brethren. There is, you can, you can choose if you wish to move on. Yeah, and go and get a life.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5390s)

And [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5390s) can follow that advice that you got from your scuba diving thing as well, you know, if they, if they want to leave in five years time or whatever, then what do they need to do in a years time and so on and and think about it.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5404s)

Absolutely right. Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA1bYxByxkP8%26t%3D5407s)

And I think at the end of the day, it's just the constant reiteration from from those of us who have learned it, but it's that whole thing is just not true. I mean, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5417s)

I'm gonna read this email, then I'll let you comment, Bradley. So we received an email from an insider and it's one of the reasons why I have really wanted to go down this road with, we just put up Paul's podcast and what was such timing when Tom emailed. So Bruce, this is the email.

“ Brucey raised the subject of Aberdeen again recently. He must find it a real threat if he keeps talking about it. Anyway, he was quite worked up, virtually yelling things like there was no [evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5447s) and people believed a lie.

So Brucey, I have a question for you. Let's put aside whether anything lewd did or didn't happen. However, it certainly looked like something lewd happened and therefore had the appearance of evil. And haven't PBCC members been booted out in the past for doing things that had the appearance of evil? It just doesn't pass the sniff test, Brucey. People do have eyes, ears and brains, you know, they can work this stuff out and see it for what it is. And if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and sounds like a duck…”

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5477s)

Yeah, look, if I was, if I had the opportunity of having a typical sort of what we would call a cross-examination of the witnesses at Aberdeen, I would love that, you know. Unfortunately, some of those are probably no longer with us. I'm not sure who's still around that was here on those days. But if you look at the first-hand reports, there's no doubt about the fact that they were both in the same bed together. There's no doubt about, I think it's even conceded that [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5515s) was no clothes being worn, at least by Madeline.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5518s)

Well, she acknowledges it in the statement she gave to the court in the Netherlands. I mean, correct.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5526s)

Openly, yeah. And was that the Dutch book case? And and you know, the concept of an ambush, I mean, that was, that was an invention after the fact. The fact is nobody, nobody expected him to say that it was an ambush because, you know, he was in the end stages of alcoholism. He died only about two or three months after that.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5557s)

And he had ample, he had had, I mean, his power was absolute. This idea that he had to like to draw, draw people out and had to create this whole situation to get rid of, he could have gotten rid of anybody. Yeah, but the drop, yeah, I mean, they're just at will. I mean, it, it just, it doesn't pass the sniff test. It really doesn't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5581s)

We've had insiders tell us that Bruce is talking about the same thing, that he's going to find a way to draw the opposers out and the people in there that aren't following him. And I'm like, he just, he does all this stuff that sets him up in case something happens, right? We know that the Aberdeen, the whole Aberdeen incident, I mean, not even just the Aberdeen as of years before this all is, he knows it's the biggest [flaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5611s) in the foundation that he sets his church on top of, right? So it is, it is one of those things that is very passionate for me to keep exploiting, keep bringing out, bring the people on, let's get talking about this so that those inside there can really realize that yes, this did happen.

And that point on from JTJr when I, when everything was exploited, to me set the stage for everything that has happened since, including what I went through. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5641s) truly believe that I would have not went through and suffered what I went through had it been completely dealt with at JTJr's time, had it been brought up, had he been dealt with and the real truth been dealt with the way that it should have been dealt with. I don't think we'd be having account after account after account after account of these horrible stories that have happened to me. He made it okay to have things covered up, to lie, to protect the [testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5671s), create these false, false realities that are just, that cover up such horrible things that have happened.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5682s)

So let me tell you about the last time I met JTJr in Adelaide. He came, he came and he took meetings in Adelaide and of course, you know, I think it was during school time, so we had to knock off school early and go, etc, etc. And anyway, he turned up, he was obviously drunk, you know, he was slurring his speech and he kept on saying this phrase, “it's about time we took off our straitjackets.” He kept on saying,” it's about time we took off our straitjackets.” And as a young 16 year old, of course, you know, that that sounded fabulous to me. It sounded like he was about to say we don't have to have so many rules, you know, that we can be a bit more flexible.

Anyway, about, oh, and I should mention, I, I don't want to say who this person is because I don't want to embarrass anybody, but I'd been very close friends with a brethren [girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5738s) for a long time and I'm sure we both thought we were going to get married, probably as soon as we turned 18\. And so, and I've told you about the car accident and after the car accident, it was her father who was one of the senior people said something like that I'd had it coming to me for a while, I think is what the words that he used apparently. So I was a little bit concerned about that. And then he'd, the father had [found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5768s) out that the girl and I had exchanged photographs, which of course was a complete taboo topic. So we had to give the photographs back. And anyway, we...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5778s)

Should say though, let's just be clear for those that are not, that do not understand the PBCC, that these would have just been like, they're, they're, they're not like x-rated photos. These are just, I could see people's minds going, these are not x-rated photos. These will just be like, we're not...

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5795s)

Saying, yeah, we're not sending each other photos on a phone. These, these are black and white, tiny little portraits of a face, you know, which was, you know, just marvelous for me to have this photo of this gorgeous girl. And presumably, I hope she felt the same. Anyway, not, anyway, I'll get, I'll get to the point. So JTJr said this thing about the straight jackets, you see. And about three or four months later, in one of those curious twists of life, [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5826s) Mr Bales, the Bales I talked about earlier, he had a daughter who had married and was living in Sydney, who was about to have her first child. And so Mrs Bales wanted to go to Sydney to be with her daughter who had to have her first child. But it meant that he would be away for the ministry meeting, for the Tuesday night ministry meeting.

And in those days, I don't know whether it's still the same, but in those days, you, you know, the ministry meeting was, what was it called, the clarion call or something or other. You had to, everyone had to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5856s) at your home assembly for the ministry meeting every Tuesday night. And so he asked for permission. He got up, he spoke in a reading meeting and said, you know, you want to ask the brethren, would it be okay if he went to Sydney and stayed there for a week so he'd be away for the ministry meeting? And there was all this debate going on about it, you know, oh, you know, we need to be committed to the testimony and all those sort of phrases. And like, you know, because I was a very enthusiastic young [brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5886s) and, you know, I basically could quote fierce slabs of the bible off by heart, etc. So I just picked up the microphone and I said, quoting JTJr who the week or two earlier, maybe a little longer had said, I said, isn't it about time we took off our straitjackets?

Now that, that was a seminal moment in my brethren history because it could have gone either way. It could have been this, you know, this is the words of the wise young man or it could have been, you naughty boy. And it was the latter. And somebody, one of the leader brothers picked up the microphone and said, you know, that's just a very cheeky and rude thing to say and it [shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5926s) how far away from where you are, you should be, etc. This is to a 16 year old young man. So I immediately at that stage, my first reaction of course was that might have jeopardized my chances of actually maintaining my relationship and getting married to this, this girl, you know. As, but you know, in the, in the way things happen, that might have been a good thing because when, when dad decided to leave, I wasn't, you know, we hadn't [spoken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5957s) to each other for a few, for two or three months or something because of that incident.

But you know, talking about the JT junior sort of, he could say something like that, he could say something like that and everyone would go, yeah, we understand what, well, I don't know what he actually meant, but you couldn't repeat it yourself because if you repeated it yourself, you were being cheeky and rude. I don't understand, you know, no one understands the logic of these things. And the fact is that the world leader just lives in a complete [vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=5987s) of rationality and can make those sort of statements without any judgment or justification. And I presume Bruce is the same, you know, that whatever he says goes and he doesn't have to justify it or rationalize it in any way whatsoever.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6001s)

Yeah, and one of those firsthand accounts of Aberdeen, this one brother said that JT Jr had been saying, I can do things no one else can do, which is, which is exactly what you're saying and it's, it's only gotten stronger, I think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6023s)

And again, I just make my statement. It's like, to me, it just goes back to them. It goes back to JTJr. You know? Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6031s)

Stones were loose in the foundation at the beginning, but it really, JTJr.'s whole demise really let the thing blossom.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6042s)

Yeah. It's where the gas was poured on the fire.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6045s)

Turned into the poison ivy that it's become.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6048s)

Yeah.

### [**Bradley McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6050s)

Swirling and snaking around and choking.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6053s)

So the Tuesday night ministry meeting when Dad said he was leaving, then the Wednesday night when Richard withdrew from the entire Adelaide brethren, which was a fairly strong decision and a high tense, high drama moment. But as Richard walked out, the words, we withdraw from Richard Grace, were uttered by Gar Gooden, one of the leading young brothers in Adelaide. So when we got home, you know, here's me a brethren boy who's always obeyed every single possible rule, not quite sure what's going on. And then dad and mum say, oh, you know, Richard and his family are coming for dinner tomorrow night on Thursday night.

And I remember thinking, what are we going to do when it comes time to eat, you know, because he's withdrawn from. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6111s) this moment is indelibly engraved in my mind where we sat down at the green Laminex  kitchen table in 1970\. Richard's there, dad's there, I'm there, mum's there, Richard's wife Jenny's there. And I looked at my dad and I thought, we're gonna eat food with someone who's withdrawn from. And I, I just couldn't believe that we were going to do it. And dad picked up his fork and started to eat. And nothing happened. It was fine. Nothing happened. It was absolutely us. Nothing happened, nothing changed. And that was, that was kind of the very first brethren rule I'd ever broken, I suppose. And it's been a series of rules since, but the fact is the brethren rules are just complete nonsense. They don't actually matter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6168s)

What would you say to the insiders in there that get really hung up on the rules in there, but still have one foot in, one foot out. How would you say, like, what would you say to them to help them start unraveling that so it can give them to be able to get that next foot out?

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6191s)

Well, I think the question you'd need to ask yourself is, you know, if you're a committed Christian, which some, you know, some I gather some inside would definitely be, then go and have a look and see whether in fact the bible says exactly what that rule is supposed to be saying. Is is there something in the bible that says that or is that just Bruce's idea of what the bible says? Because I will guarantee there's no verses in the bible that talk about, you know, not wearing a tie. I remember when that ministry came in and it would, you know, be done with the ties of nature. I mean, seriously, what a perversion of interpretation is that? That's just ridiculous nonsense.

All of these rules about, you know, there and there are hundreds of them, they are man-made rules. They're made up by somebody who is in power and able to do so. And to be perfectly frank about it, the reason they make new rules and they keep changing rules is so that they have power over you. They want you to have to jump when they say jump and they want you to change when they say change. That's why the “Lord turns a corner.“ God [doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6273s) turn corners. God's consistent. If you know, God is a straightforward, omniscient, omnipotent being, he doesn't turn corners. That's rubbish. That's what, and I...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6284s)

Think, I actually, I'm going to read a little excerpt out of an email I got. This is another email that we had come in that they gave me permission to read out. I'm just going to read a little, just a short excerpt of it. And he's, what this, this person is talking is they're talking about how there's no talk of Christianity in there. You can't, you don't talk, you don't bring up the word God or Jesus. It, when people do, they look at you funny. And let me just find where I can start here.

**PBCC Insider email**

“I feel like the conversation goal is getting further and further away from what's really important to the point where it's now out of control and being fueled by people propped up as successful, influential, close to our brother, for everyone to follow after, take directions from. There is no getting back to basics now. The simple things that matter most have been left in the dust. I have a hard time recalling a time where someone genuinely impromptu spoke raw and openly from their heart of their faith, spiritual experiences in a casual setting unscripted. I [guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6345s) people just don't have those conversations in social settings. Where is our faith? Why isn't it talked about? Is it alone in Jesus? What really matters? Who am I serving?

I find strength in honestly asking myself these questions. The answers are so easy when put it in simple terms. One thing that is so true is that you can't see through it until one day you start to and then you can't unsee it. But then what to do next? Stay with your broken soul or leave, breaking the hearts of your family [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6376s) well as your own on the way out.”

 And so it's this, this email, I mean, it was quite lengthy, I just gave an excerpt of it, is it just broke my heart in the sense that right, those those Christians that are in there that are, their souls are seeking that juice in their life are being starved of it. And it's being replaced with this robotic man that doesn't fulfill what true Christians are looking for, you know?

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6406s)

And my dad, that's the reason that my dad made the decision to leave because the beloved JT junior was being talked about more than the Lord Jesus. And I remember having this conversation with these two boys that were in my year 12 class with me who were brethren boys and I said, that's the reason we're leaving. And one of them came back, he did come back to me and speak to me about a week later, I reckon. And he said, last night at the reading [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6436s), I counted and there were 19 references to the Lord Jesus and 14 references to the Beloved. So I'm going to stay. And I remember thinking at the time, what a strange way in which to make your decision. But it sounds like from what you've just said as if the score might be slightly different these days.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6458s)

Oh, I think the score is very different. Yeah, I think the score is very different nowadays. Yeah, I invite those that listen to our podcast, we know there's a lot of them, to just start seeding that you, you have a choice. Like when you go about your day, just ask yourself like, what choices are yours and what choices are from the PBCC community? Which ones are yours and what would you be doing? Just ask yourself, what would you be [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6488s), what choices would you make that differently if you weren't in there? What would those choices make? Just let yourself start thinking just like that.

And I love that exercise. I think everybody should do the exercise Tom spoke about. I mean, what an incredible way to like, where do you see yourself 10 years from now? What do you want? I really think that that is something that each and every one of us should sit down and do. And it just gives us a little mirror into checking the freedom that [we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6518s) left for and those that are wanting to leave for some freedom.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6521s)

Yeah, and I, I said before we started to record that there's a, there's a film that I watched a few years ago, it's dated now, called Shawshank Redemption. And it's a film about a chap who's in prison and stays in prison and then is released towards the end of his life. And I'm not going to spoil the end of it, but [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6551s) very similar to where I started today in terms of the story about the sulfur crested cockatoo, that if you stay too long and you don't make the choice, it can get to the point where you won't exist outside. You're just not about going to be able to adapt.

But that's a, you know, my dad was 61 when he left and he never really changed his theological stance, but he did really have an enjoyable life after he left, even at 61\. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6582s) people can, people can make a late decision. But in my, in my experience as a now 70 year old, just do it. Just start, make the step right down the 10 year goal, write down the five-year goal, start going by the burner phone if you need to, find out what it's like, start to make some, you know, contacts with people outside. 

And I, I've, you know, over my period [since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6612s) I left, I've had young people who've left that have come and seen me and and we've sat down and had coffee together. And I know of at least two who have as a result of chatting with me and hearing my story, I've gone, you know what, I'll go back to uni too. And I know, I've, two, I know two who have done that who now have professional careers. One of whom is a descendant of one of my good friends at school. And, you know, I think that's a lovely sort of [circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6642s) back. And certainly if there are people who want to chat about it, I'm open to do that.

### [**Paul**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA1bYxByxkP8%26t%3D6648s) **Flowerdew**

I was going to say, Tom, the fact that you studied later in life, obviously you studied when you were 18, I suppose, at that technical college, but the fact that you then studied law later in life also shows those that might be thinking of leaving that it is possible to do that. Ok, things might not come quite as easily as you get older because you tend to be slower at picking things up, don't you, the older you get? But it is possible.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA1bYxByxkP8%26t%3D6678s)

And, well, I'm not sure, I'm not sure it does actually get harder, Paul, because what I found was that when I went to uni and I at the same when I did my law degree, I was running a business and I had four teenage [sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6700s). So, you know, it was hard work. But the fact is that when you're an adult and you're coming to it with a mature mindset, you tend to do what needs to be done and you don't do what doesn't need to be done. You know, you probably don't spend a lot of time at the pub drinking with the other students. Perhaps, you know, that time you might spend doing what you need to do to survive, but you can do it. You can. And these days, of course, you can do it online. There's a lot of courses you can even study law online and there's even free, there's lots of free courses as well.

I mean, because one of the things that might be a barrier is, you know, the fact that you might have to pay for it if you're giving up a highly paid job inside and I can only get something menial outside, that might be a fear that people have. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6756s) well, that's, that that is so. But you know, again, for example, in my instance, you know, once I finished my law degree and you know, I don't think I had a lot of confidence about what I was going to do when I finished my law degree. And when I was nearly finished, I had my building business going at the time. I remember one of the clients I was building for when he found out that I was nearly finished a law degree, he said to me, you realize you're going to be able to get a job pretty quickly as a lawyer. And I was like, well, I'm about that. But I got [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6786s) job at a high-end law firm straight away. In Australia, when you finish your law degree, you have to do six weeks working in a law firm, usually for no pay.

And so I applied at this high-end law firm on advice from somebody, one of the judges actually, friends, who would you believe was a Mormon, a Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter-day Saints. And the chap I knew who was a Mormon said, oh, look, I know this judge. And so these are the connections that you don't even realize these things are going to happen. And so he said, this is the law firm you should, approach. So I approached them and they said yes. And I went there and two days after I started on [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6828s) free six weeks for a career there, which I thought was going to be six weeks, they came and said, would you like a job? And I was like, what? I didn't expect to have that offer straight away. But the fact that you are coming with a set of good values and you know, whatever you've done in the past in terms of your experience will be valuable in your new career, whatever it is you choose.

And they offered me the job and I, and I got real, did really well there. And you know, I'm not, I don't want to blow [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6858s) own trumpet, but if you, if you google online, if you get a burner phone, google online, you'll see, you know, I'm now recognized as one of the three preeminent lawyers in South Australia in construction law. That, and you know, that's simply because of that seminar that I went to, you know, 30 odd years ago where this chap said to me, set yourself a goal. And I did it and I started to work towards it and I, and I had knockbacks. So it's not as if I got in the first time. I got knocked back from three or four times, I think it was, and eventually got in. The hardest part was actually getting in, to be honest. Once I got in, I found it relatively straightforward. The study and the concept of learning and [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6906s) in my 40s, I found that was fine.

And I think the point to make out is that you got to choose what you were passionate about. I mean, we hear all the time about the UBT seminars that are happening inside the PBCC church and all these businessmen that have to go to them. You just, you sit back and you wonder where all the lawyers and the doctors and the vet, like all these different other careers that they probably would be passionate about doing it and yet they're stuck building their own business, right? Yeah. And so I think again, I invite those insiders that are listening to [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6939s) about what you're passionate about, right? Not just what you're building this, you know, magnificent business, but to think about what you're actually passionate about because I do, I believe that inside the PBCC is probably a doctor waiting to come out, a lawyer waiting to to be built. It's just, it's more than just about making money, it's about following your passion and having choices. And I think Tom, you've described it beautifully with everything that you were able [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6969s) choose from the age of 17 on, right? Even though you got sidestepped into your own little group that was like the Rentons, but you still, you still had choice within that.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=6980s)

Yeah, well, you know, we actually only like my first wife and I, we stayed there until our first son was born and there's a choice we made as well because we were in this very small group of about 20, 25, by that time about 25 people, I suppose. And I remember when my first son was born, we talked about it and we just thought, do you know what, we don't want to bring our son up in a really small group [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7010s) that and limit his choices about his friends. And so we went and joined what's known as the open brethren, which you would know in brethren history is a split back in the late 19th century. And we were there for a number of years and they were lovely, lovely people. They really were lovely people.

And then after that was when I went through my, I learned the New Testament, most of the New Testament off by heart because I was so passionate in my Christianity. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7040s) became a very, very, you know, avid Christian, if you like, even much more committed than I had been at any other stage in my life. And then we moved to a Baptist church after that. And again, beautiful community of people. And then various things occurred and we moved on from there. But you do have those choices and there are just so many welcoming communities that will support and embrace you if you're prepared to take the step.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7072s)

Thank you so much for coming on. I so appreciated you taking the time to send the email you did. It was very well, very thorough. You articulated it so well that I didn't even know who you were. I was like, yeah, we need to book him in. So I appreciate you coming on here and being so vulnerable and allowing us a little peace and look into your life. And I know, and hopefully it will inspire some insiders to [reevaluate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7103s) their choices and maybe feel what they're passionate about more than what 's in there and know that they can step out. We all, everybody is here that you're able to reach out to any of us here. If you're looking for more help, you can contact the Olive Leaf Network or info.getalifeatproton.me. But there is a lot of help and support out here. And I thank you once again, Tom, for coming on and sharing this with us. Thank you so much.

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7132s)

I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you very much. And I, I often think if there were 150 direct descendants of my grandmother in 1970, how many would there be now? Yeah. So there would be, there would be a lot of extended family inside and there are, there are a few I know who have left, but there are many, many, many more who have not. And I, I guess my hope is that they might see this and go, that's what I could do. And if [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7162s) any that would like to do that, I'd be very happy to sit down and have a cup of coffee with them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7167s)

And your address will be available on social media? Like people can find you or do you have an email?

### [**Tom Grace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7172s)

Facebook is where you'll probably find me the easiest. But certainly if you google my name, Tom Grace and lawyer in Adelaide, my email address in my mobile phone numbers there. So perfect.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7185s)

Awesome. Well, thank you. Thank you, Bradley for showing up and Paul for supporting this. Thank you so much. Until next time, everyone. Much love to you all. Bye bye.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1bYxByxkP8&t=7195s)

Bye now.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
