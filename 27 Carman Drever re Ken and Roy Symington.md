This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

Hello everyone. Welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today with the regular crew. If you're new to the show, it's me, myself, Lane, with Richard, Carman, and Cheryl. We are all ex-members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, an international cult. And we love talking about what it was like inside the church.

We bring you news about what's going on inside the [church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=40s) currently. And today we have some really great footage and a story that's really going to be very interesting about Roy Symington. So we're going to show you some footage to get things started. And Carman's going to tell us a little bit about that footage. Carman, what are we about to see?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=67s)

I put together a little video to tell the first half of the story. And it's actually just sort of a little video to tell about my dad.

Okay.

### [**Generic Voice**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=82s)

This is a small glimpse into the life of Kenneth Symington, my father, born in 1945 to James and Beatrice Symington. This is James H. Symington at 23 years of age taken in Canada. Neche, North Dakota was a small farming town located about a mile or more from the Canadian border.

This is the town James and Beatrice Symington would raise their children in. They had a family of five boys. Kenny was the middle child. This is an aerial photo of the town of Neche.

Welcome to Main Street in my hometown. The Symington children began their lives living on the farm.

They later moved into the town of Neche. Ken Symington graduated from high school in Neche, North Dakota.

In 1968 through 1971, there was a draft for young men to join the Army. Ken Symington was drafted to serve his country. Fort Carson is a military base located in Colorado. While stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado, the Symington family became a family of three.

Late in 1970, a little baby girl was born. Life in the military became the Symington family's daily normal. Fort Carson was a day's journey for many of the Brethren localities, so the family spent a lot of time together enjoying their little baby. They did attend church in Gothenburg, Council Bluffs, when they had a long weekend.

In 1971, when the draft was ended, the Symington family returned to Neche.

Kenny began to work for his elder brother, Roy Symington, in the construction business. This photo was taken in 1974 when Harold Symington and Ken Symington were digging a grave for Harold's father, Archie Symington.

Who could have known both Harold and Ken would be taken in the year after this?

This is my dad's passport photo. This photo was taken in spring of 1975\.

We were all sick in this picture.

Dad offered to babysit us so mom could run to the pharmacy and pick up our medicine.

While mom was picking up our medicine, dad had some overseas visitors at the house.

They took this picture.

Symington Construction, the home of the construction business owned by Roy Symington. This is where my father worked.

Located kitty corner to the main church hall in Neche, North Dakota. This is also the place of a tragic accident that took the life of my father, Ken Symington on July 29, 1975\.

On July 29, 1975 a tragic accident occurred.

I remember being home. Mom was putting on a meal for a table full of company.

When my grandparents pulled up outside, I knew that something terrible had happened. I had climbed up on the counter and was watching from the kitchen window.

A picture of their faces is permanently etched in my memory. July 29, 1975\. I recently asked a first-hand witness to tell me his version of the day my father was taken. I've heard things over the years and knew my own four-and-a-half-year-old perspective, but I want to share this account. 

“I did work with your dad a lot. He was a good man and a good worker. He had got a new pickup truck and Roy paid him about a hundred dollars a month to use it at work. We were working [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=295s) rollers on the old shitty crane and Roy decided to swing the crane in circles. The ball and tackle were going to hit Kenny's new truck, so he grabbed it so it wouldn't. The crane hit the high-line wire, causing power to arc, and killed him.”

 I asked;

“ Was it ordinary for Roy to operate the crane in circles like that? I think we all know Roy was a wild ass of a man, but was this normal operation?’

The answer;

“Roy always did stupid things, he only cared about himself. He came out of the office one time, we were loading the backhoe to go to work with no bathroom at the shop. So Kenny went home to crap. Roy came out, where's Kenny? I said he had to crap. Roy said tell him to shit on his own time, not mine. He was a wrong gay.”

 My response;

“I heard versions of what happened that day. And my gut feeling was Roy was probably at least negligent that day. And as a result, my dad died.

The response;

“ Yeah, it's Roy's fault. Good to talk about Kenny again. I miss him too.’

James Symington was the worldwide leader of the PBCC in 1975\.

He felt the death of his son very deeply and very personally.

The following three clips are quotes from things he said that are printed in church ministry. The books these clips are located in are copyrighted by the Bible Gospel Trust of Middlesex, England.

[**James Symington**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=295s)

“The Lord laid his hand on the one among us that represented something different, more formation in the divine nature than anyone else. They were trying to help him, you know. Two or three others were trying to help him. They thought he'd be improved if he had a little more fire in his activity, and a little more aggressiveness, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=408s) he was too clear for that. They wanted him to work 15 to 20 hours a day, well he did it. And he didn't complain either. There were no words exchanged, but he had a judgment about it he said it's not right. The day before the Lord took him, he told his wife, something's going to happen, the way they were working is not right. He was taken the next day. They couldn't change it because it was formation in the divine nature.”

“It took his death to get through to others, a young man, in the pink of health, in the prime of his life. Family responsibility cut off in an instant.”

“You see, somebody tried to convince me that my son who died was against me. Well, I fought that one tooth and nail. I made him swallow it. I said, he never was against me.” 

“But they couldn't change him, and he died to change them. And if we fail the Lord in that connection, he'll hold us to it. I'm sure he will.”

“There were no words between them. There were no words. If he had to work 13, 14, 15 hours, he worked that long with no complaint. But he told his wife. But she didn't suppose, nor would I have, that that's what would happen. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=480s) broke the heart of some of us, but it brought out hardness in others, absolute bitterness. It was the devil.”

“He took one of the best young men we had to teach us something. I knew what was going on wasn't up to the standard. I knew that. And I thought, well, it'll work itself out. Time will change it. It reached a point. Who did the Lord mean more than anybody else? Me. Can you follow that? And my son his brother.”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=512s)

So, just to get a clear picture there, Jim Symington, the leader, he is saying there, those are quotes from him, saying that he basically knew that there were unsafe work practices going on at the job site. Is that what I'm getting from that? Yeah. Wow. Okay. So he knew that stuff.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=566s)

So yeah, what I mean, what a way to start the podcast off with a video like that but I do think, Carman, it is a super-super important story to be told. I think the other side of the story needs to be told because there's only been this one perception or this one part of this story that's told and I think now is the time where you get to tell your side of the story.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=594s)

And I think it's important to clarify, I would say this to all of Roy's children, they're not to blame for anything that happened back then and bringing out this story is definitely not to cast any aspersions on them. And they lived with Roy Symington, they knew exactly what he was capable of. The stories that if they came on here, the stories that they could tell us would probably shock anyone who had ever sat in [Roy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=624s) Symington's presence.

I can't speak for them, but I can just speak for the fact that bringing up the story is not to reflect on them at all. Most of them refused to come back to the meeting simply because of what he was and what he is until the day that he died. I don't think he ever changed. And part of that, I guess, if you back yourself out of the whole immediate picture, part of that was probably his father's doing because he never [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=658s) held his feet to the fire and held him accountable.

He covered what happened. And therefore, Roy spent his entire life running from what he did on that day, July 29, 1975\. And I firmly believe that. I firmly believe that's what drove him to be as crazy as he was, to beat his children, to beat his wife, to drink like an alcoholic, collect 24/7, to have absolutely no respect for law and order. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=688s) it isn't a secret that every time the cops were in town, Roy was running for them, running from them. And you could ask any law enforcement officer in Pembina County and they're going to tell you the same thing. And I guess one of the reasons to tell this story is to show people that are inside there what they were walking with.

I think it's really important that they know the whole story to know what you're walking with.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=719s)

And let the viewers and listeners know where Roy Symington was in the hierarchy in there. That's probably important to tell them.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=726s)

My father said that Roy Symington was like another Man of God, like another Jesus.

And this is the kind of guy he actually was. So these are the types of people, they [idolize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=743s) and worship terrible people.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=749s)

I think there's a bit of a political, there's a kind of a political backstory there. And that is that when, that the Hales family were never very popular in North America, they weren't well accepted. I think when James Symington died, if you think about it, there'd been James Taylor Sr., James Taylor Jr. In other words, the Man of God, the elect vessel, had been an American since, [what,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=780s) 1905 or something. And the American, in particular the Americans, but probably the Canadians as well, found it hard to accept that the next man of God wasn't going to be from North America.

It was going to be one of these foreign Hales’s from Australia. So when Bruce Hales kind of got in, and I suppose John Hales, they kind of used Roy Symington as a political prop to try [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=810s) boost the Hales image to make the Haleses acceptable in the USA, because of course it connected with the old Symington name. It gave us sort of a continuity. And so Roy Symington was boosted up and promoted and all sorts of wonderfully nice things were said about him. He was allowed to divorce his wife who had left the brethren and he was kind of given a new bride on a plate. He was given a massive business, which he was quite incapable of [running,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=840s) but he got all the benefit from it. They basically buttered him up and pushed him up and boosted him up as the kind of representative of the Hales family in the USA just because he had the right name. That's my perception of it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=854s)

Yeah, yeah, I think that's 100% right. And so back up a little bit, I'm going to take us down just a little teeny tiny rabbit hole and I think I'm going to go down this rabbit hole. It's really hard to talk about it, but I think there's a lot of people inside there that, well after the death, after a death like that, you find people don't want to talk about it. And it's kind of like taboo or something to talk about a death or to talk, I mean, especially from a kid's point [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=884s) view. And there's nobody to talk to because nobody wants to talk to you about it.

So you kind of live with your gut feeling and what you can overhear. So as a little girl, I mean, I knew what my gut feeling was and everything about that day is etched. I can tell you what Grandma Symington was wearing, I can tell you what Grandpa Symington was wearing, I can tell you about their little car when it pulled up out front. We had a house full of company, mom was trying to [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=914s) them to sit down and eat and of course dad wasn't home yet, but it was getting close to meeting time. Everything about that is etched in my brain. But the one thing that I always go back to, and maybe it was like my first faith struggle, I just knew in my gut that Roy had done this and he was a bad guy.

And I remember we were little and we would get our pajamas on and we'd come downstairs and mom would say, we'd get our glass of milk or cereal, whatever, and she would send us back up to bed and she'd say, "You need to kneel down and you need to say your prayers before you get into bed." And I would get up there and I would get ready to kneel down, of course I had to kneel down because my sister would have ratted on me because she [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=960s) there too. And I remember going, I know I'm supposed to say my prayers, but I don't want to, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=968s) you took my dad and you left Roy here and he's mean, he's ugly, he's not good to anyone.

And it didn't make any sense to me. And then I would sneak up into bed, Cindy thought I'd said my prayers, and I would get into bed and I would just lay there and the house would start to make all these creaky noises like houses do and you get really scared and you lay there and you start to cry and your pillow gets wet. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=999s) finally sometime during the night, I would actually get out of bed and say my prayers and say, "Okay, I guess, I guess this must be your plan, you know." And it was so hard from a kid's point of view, like the only things you hear is what you overhear.

And right from that early moment, I just knew, I just knew there was just such a difference. Like my dad was the one that, you know, he would stay [until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1029s) the last person after a fellowship meeting to make sure that nobody had car trouble, make sure everybody got on the bus. Nobody told him to, that was just something that he did. And every interchange, he was the guy that would stay in the parking lot to make sure everybody had a house to go to and then if there was somebody that accidentally got left off a list, he would just bring them home, be just more people for mom to feed. And that's the kind of person that he was.

And Roy, right from the [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1059s) first memory of him, was just a hard, nasty, you know, very crass. And his kids, that was my first memory from his kids, they ran from him, they had nothing good to say about him. And find out later it was because they were getting beat. He would beat them with a belt, he would beat them with a two-by-four, and those kids, they had it rough.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1090s)

Wow, I mean, I'm the same age as you, Carman, and I was, yeah, so I was about five when the news came through and I can remember the kind of shock in the locality way over in the UK when we heard that Kenny Symington had been taken.

But we were never told that Roy Symington had anything to do with it. My impression was that it was your father had been driving the crane and had driven it into the power lines as if it was an error that he had made. We were never told that he was actually just a bystander that was killed by someone else's fooling around and stupidity. So I mean, I think this is going to be an eye-opener to a lot of Brethren because I suspect that outside of, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1137s) know, the kind of North America grapevine, I suspect people who grew up in Australia, New Zealand, UK, Europe had no idea that Roy was involved.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1146s)

Yeah, yeah. And what's funny is, and this flips a little bit further ahead, but people from the town have shared that with me more readily than the family.

You know, his own brothers have never shared what really happened. I don't know. Maybe they don't know.

Because Grandpa Symington, it appears, made every effort to cover up what really happened. And I'm not saying that Roy Symington went to work that day and was going to kill his brother. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying he built up such an abuse and he took advantage of his brother in such a way that on that very day, he had told my dad to put the crane away because they were having a fellowship meeting or the night before the fellowship meeting. There was buses [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1197s) at the meeting room and Roy knew he had a load of metal coming in and his favorite thing to do was to make them wait till the next morning and he would unload them the next morning, which meant there's no motels in Neche, no motels within 20, 30 miles around. They would have to sleep in their truck, which dad always objected to.

And this particular day, he told my dad to go put the crane away and he told him 10 other things to do and my dad was still doing the 10 other things and [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1227s) of a sudden Roy looks over, the buses have all pulled up, he's got to get this load of metal unloaded and he gets pissed off and he climbs up in the crane and he's jerking it around and next thing dad was dead on the ground. Yeah, you know, and two witnesses that were there that day said there was no doubt in their mind that was how it was going to end.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1254s)

Yeah, can you just tell us the order that your grandpa's sons came in? Like, like your uncles, who was the oldest and what order did they come in?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1264s)

Walt was the oldest, and then Roy, and then Dad, and then Verne, and then Ron.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1270s)

Oh, that's interesting, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1272s)

Yeah, so Dad was the middle child. Yeah, yeah. So when the draft came down, Dad, I mean, of course they were all sort of scuttling trying to get out of the draft. Dad, yeah, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1286s)

We have a word for that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1289s)

If you're going to get, if you're going to get drafted and you have to be a conscientious objector, like you can't get drafted and be an actual soldier.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1299s)

Yeah, I don't have a great opinion of conscientious objectors myself. Yeah, but like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1304s)

Lane, you have to remember this wasn't a draft into the Canadian Navy, this was a draft of Vietnam, which was a pretty horrific place to go to. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1315s)

So yeah, I'm not, I'm not saying it wasn't, but, but, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1317s) being a conscientious objector is saying, "Oh, I'll do everything else, but, but, you know, my conscience won't let me, won't let me shoot a gun or whatever." Well, then, I don't know, I just have my own opinion of that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1329s)

Yeah, and it wasn't a choice that they got to make. I mean, that was the position that they were told they had to take.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1335s)

Yeah, that's what I mean. The Brethren, the Brethren said, "Oh, you had to be a conscientious objector, you had to be a conscientious objector." Yet they all are gung-ho and support the death penalty. So yeah, you're totally fine with death and killing as long as you're not the one doing it because you're too high and mighty to pull a trigger.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1353s)

Very, it's very two-faced, yes.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1356s)

Yeah, yeah. And so then, so then it came down that they could only take one from a family. So then you got jostling between the kids, who's the guy that's going to be drafted? And my dad actually had attended college to try and get out of it in Winnipeg where he met my mom and he had tried to get out of it that way and eventually it just came down and he was the first one from the family that was like right in the age bracket.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1386s)

But that, so, so it was, yeah, if you're going to university, you didn't have to go. And that makes sense, right? You need people going to university and getting degrees. I agree with that. I just don't agree with the Brethren's policy of conscientious objector. Okay, I have nothing against your father.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1401s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm sure, I mean, I don't know what whether he would have preferred that or not. I don't, I don't know. I know he was a medic, so I don't know where that went to. But you know, so he gets shipped away, he's married, he gets shipped away and of course Verne was the next guy that should have been drafted. And instead of taking his married brother's spot, he says, "Oh no, my brother's in." So...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1431s)

Really? That was nice.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1433s)

Yep. So not to rat him out, that's just, that was exactly what happened. So and then of course Ron was the younger one. So, so it went, he was drafted, he took mom and they went to Colorado.

They went through basic down in San Antonio and then lived in Colorado Springs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1461s)

How have you, I mean, I know you've had a lot of people talking to you and you've had a lot of information come your way, how do you have the picture of how this was covered up?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1476s)

Well, let's go through life growing up. Okay, so you are Grandpa Symington's grandchild. Your mother is raising four kids alone. So the first thing they did to her is they said, "You can't go get a job. You need to stay home and you need to take care of your kids," which that was no problem. I mean, that's what she would have preferred to do.

So she stayed home. And with all the interchange company and the fellowship meeting company and the three-day meeting company that they had back then, I don't think a person ever could have held down a job as being the sole parent in the household. And growing up, let's talk a little bit about what it's like to grow up without a dad in the Brethren.

It's tough because every time you go to meeting, everybody else's dad is watching you. And if they catch you doing something, they're coming over to tell you that you're doing it and you're doing it wrong. They're not, they're not a dad. They don't come and be nice. They come and tell you when you're doing it wrong. And you don't get to look back and you don't get to be sassy like you are to your parents, because then they turn around and go tell your mom.

I think my brothers, I think back on it [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1554s) it was so hard because some of these old guys, Grandpa Symington's brothers were the hardest on these kids and absolutely no realization that these kids are growing up in a situation where they don't have a dad and you come and chew them out for every little thing that they do.

It's hard to get any respect. And I think I saw that with Mary Bowyer's kids in Maple Creek.

Everybody tried to be their dad, but not in a good way.

I think that's so common in the Brethren.

So, but I know Grandpa Symington laid it on Roy that he was, and this is in the ministry, I've got like pages and pages of things that he told Roy, he was supposed to make sure that mom didn't have to work. And one of the things, like I don't ever know the details of what he was told, but he was supposed to compensate her for the difference between, you know, social security or whatever it was that the government paid so that she would be able to [raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1627s) us and stay home.

So in my teenage years, one of the ways that I was able to help mom is I paid her bills for her. I wrote out her checks and it was fun to me, like playing store or playing bank or whatever.

And in the process of paying the bills, we would save the big bills till the end of the year because Uncle Roy was supposed to bring a check around, and he had done this for as many years as after my dad was taken. This check came every year. Well, along about the end of 1986, there was no check. And she sat for a long time trying to figure out if it was going to come, if it wasn't going to come. She didn't want to confront him [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1674s) you don't confront Roy about anything.

He had such a temper. So she sat and, of course, then Grandpa Symington was taken in April. So she thought, well, for sure, he'll remember after April. Didn't come in April. Didn't come in May. Didn't come in June. In fact, it never came again.

So when his dad was not there to check up on him, he completely dropped what he had been told to do. And that, and that was Roy, you know. Brethren that came over and saw him in the meeting thought, you know, "Oh, he's wonderful, he's making up for what happened." No, he did it for as long as when his father was there to check on him, but as soon as his father was gone, he left her out in the cold. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1729s) she couldn't go get a job, so she had to figure out how to make the social security cover what we needed.

So I don't even know, you know, there was so little follow-up on Roy that I don't even know if his own brothers would know that that's what he did.

So that's just one of the things. He was supposed to be providing for the boys and he was supposed to be setting them up in a business and he was supposed to be thinking about their future. So he picked up one of my brothers one day, went over to Grandpa Symington's house and he sat down in the big chair in the living room and he said, "Pa, there's some land for sale up in Walhalla area. And I'm thinking this would be a really good [idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1785s) to invest in for Kenny's kids."

You know, "buying this farmland, we could get them going in a farm and it would be really good for their future."

And as the conversation went on, I understand grandpa said that he thought that was a great idea.

My brother that was sitting there at the time said, you know, grandpa gave him the go-ahead to go ahead and do it. Well, I wasn't at the house, didn't hear that part, but grandma got in her little gray car, she drove her over to our house and she sat down with mom and I was sitting right there and she told mom that the boy's future was being taken care of. Roy had come and got money and he went and bought farmland up in Walhalla and he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1833s) supposed to be getting a farm going up and going for the boys. So that was the story we had always carried.

Come along to 1998, I was in Neche and Grandma, it was actually Rick and I and the whole entire zoo, all five of the kids, we stayed at Grandma's house. And she once again told us, she said, "I want you to make sure you understand that father took care of Kenny and Wes. Roy came and [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1863s) money and that farmland is up there for all you kids and he's supposed to be getting a farm going for the kids." And of course at that point, Roy was out of fellowship, but she still had faith that he was going to come back.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1882s)

So Kenny and Wes are your brothers, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1885s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1886s)

Okay.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1887s)

Yeah, and at that time they were out, like they left, oh I got married in '89, so they left very shortly after that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1896s)

What exactly were the circumstances around Roy Symington getting confined or withdrawn from, kicked out?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1902s)

Honestly, I'm not sure. I know that it was Vern and Bob that did it. I know that there was a million and a half business deals that have gone sideways because he had a habit of putting up a grain bin, you know, the big metal grain bins, put up the grain bin and the box of screws would still be half full.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1928s)

Oh my god.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1930s)

Ever had a grain bin with only half the screws?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1933s)

That's not a good idea.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1934s)

No, it's really not a good idea in North Dakota.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1937s)

But he was kicked out for how many years? Wasn't it like 12 years or something? Yep. And then he went back into the church.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1944s)

He was brought back to the church, yes.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1950s)

Yeah, but he voluntarily went back in after 12 years. So right, doesn't have the highest IQ.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1960s)

He was dragged in by Bruce Hales, yeah. And basically, I mean, as far as I understand, correct me if I'm wrong, all his many misdemeanors and lovers and everything else, all the slate was wiped clean. He was given a business and a wife and a big sum of money and told to be very, very faithful to Bruce and boost Bruce's image. And he was set up for life.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=1985s)

And he did. He did just that. And they did just that. I remember because my brothers married two of his stepdaughters.

And so he came by our house a couple of times when I was young. They worshipped this guy, though. Like they really thought he was someone special.

And like to me, being out for 12 years, seeing normal life and then choosing to go back to that kind of life, the only kind of person that I think would do that is someone that would, it's a little bit narcissistic, that maybe can benefit from it, right? Like power and control. Because a lowly person, you know, like someone that has zero status in the Plymouth Brethren after 12 years, it would be [insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2039s) to go back.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2040s)

And most people who come back in don't get to the top of the hierarchy right away either.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2045s)

No, no.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2047s)

No, his whole history was cleaned up. His whole history was... do you want me to share that video?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2051s)

No, I'm actually, a good idea maybe to read the wonderful Sydney Seminar. John Boram actually, I don't know if they call it giving a word, giving a preaching, giving a reading, I don't know what it was, but John Boram gave a little speech in the Sydney Seminar and it has some enlightening cross-references in it that we could, a couple of rabbit holes we can go down.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2076s)

Yeah, so he was a speaker. He was a guest speaker. So they had speakers from all over the world this day. It was on the family portion of it. And I believe, I don't know, was he the third or fourth speaker in it? So we transcribed it. And this is what it said. So this is beginning at an hour and one and, yeah, 45 seconds. “In 1975, 16 days after the tragic death of Ken Symington…” so this is John Boram speaking;

“[In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2107s) 1975, 16 days after the tragic death of Ken Symington, Mr. and Mrs. JHS passed through Vancouver airport en route to Victoria for three-day meetings. My wife and I with three young children seized the opportunity to visit with them in the airport lounge. JHS spoke of Ken as more formed in the divine nature than anyone. He poured out his sorrow and heart-wrenching detail how Kenny was killed. With his wife quietly there beside him, he sat weeping openly in the crowded [airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2137s) lounge. He spoke of having to go tell Ken's widow about it and then taking her to the scene of the tragedy near the Neche meeting room.

Mr. Symington sobbed, telling how the young widow, expecting with child, threw herself down on the ground where Ken's body lay. During the weekend at Victoria in the house, our beloved brother sat often not saying a word, silently weeping. One meal time he told us about how Ken's young daughter in the night came asking where her daddy was. One break in the house he asked the [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2167s) present, "Have you come to watch a man weeping for his son?" How lowly our brother was to pour out his sore in a public setting. How compassionate for the young widow and her children.

In November 1977, at a time when Mr. John Hales was unavailable, Mr. Symington passed through San Francisco en route to Australia.

Prior to his departure to Sydney, he had no appetite for food and undoubtedly no appetite for what lay ahead. When it was time to depart for the airport, Mr. Symington said, "I am not going to Australia." Mrs. Symington pleaded with her husband to come, but he refused to budge. The atmosphere grew tense as the host stood by the door, anxious lest a brother missed his flight. Mrs. Symington quietly pleaded with her husband, said, "We are committed to go, [Jim,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2218s) the Australian brethren are expecting us." He emphatically repeated, "I am not going." After several more anxious minutes, Mr. Symington stood up and made his way to the door.”

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2228s)

So it's really interesting that he talks a little bit about November 1977\.

Back up just a little bit. So the day that my dad was killed, Roy went home that night and still had a house full of company, which in Neche, pretty much everybody did have a house full of company. And those companies stayed in his house. And a couple of the visitors that stayed in Roy's house, some of them stayed up and talked to him. He was of course very distraught, but he kept saying, "I killed my brother, I killed my brother."

And in November 1977, Grandpa Symington is on his way to Australia and he stops in San Francisco and as John Boram is saying, when it came time to depart from the airport, Mr. Symington said, "I'm not going to Australia." So what happened in the, and I've been told this by reliable, it came right from the person that it was, and in the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2306s) between when he got there and the time for when he was supposed to depart, he had a meeting with two brothers that had stayed at Roy's house and had heard what he had said.

And he told those, he took those two brothers into a private bedroom. So it was just him and those two brothers. And he sat them down and he said, "I understand you stayed at Roy's house." And of course, you know, they did. And he said, "If you ever, or if I ever hear of you breathing a word of what Roy Symington said that night, my son said that night, I will make sure you [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2347s) not have a place in the fellowship. You will lose your family and you will lose your job and I will make sure you are never returned to the fellowship."

And that would explain why he did not want to go to Australia.

So when I say he did a cover-up, I mean he literally threatened that if the words that Roy said, "I killed my brother," were spoken out, those people would be put out of fellowship.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2380s)

Typical cult, threatening excommunication for the truth to come out. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2390s)

Yeah, I find it so shocking because you think, I had a young brother, actually it was Craig Hoyle, message the other day. And he said he was looking through his nanny's diary. And it must have been in 1977 when JHS was going through New Zealand. And his nanny had written in her diary that Grandpa Symington said, "If the brethren didn't get the lesson from (my father) [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2420s) taken, that something more drastic would come."

But I guess my challenge is, if you hide what really happened and then tell the brethren they need to get the import of it, how is that possible?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2435s)

They just sneak, they love to just use the death only when it suits them, right? They'll say, "Oh, it was the Lord speaking” about a child dying in infancy or or someone having cancer, right? And “...but this is the Lord speaking." Oh, but what was it to other people, you know? How come it only when it suits them? What was the message to them? Right? Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2459s)

Yeah, yeah. And in that moment that he decided to hide what Roy had said, he did the biggest disservice to Roy Symington that ever possibly could have been done. And that was, he didn't make him stand up and be a man, yeah, and answer to what he did. Exactly. And Roy Symington spent the remaining 70 years, 60 years, however many years of his life, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2489s) ran because he was guilty. He knew what he did. He didn't take care of the kids that he was supposed to take care of. He didn't provide for the widow like he was supposed to take care of her. And he failed at everything because his father covered it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2507s)

I mean, I hate to say it, but to me, it looks like karma came around.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2514s)

So what happened to the farmland that was supposed to be provided for you and your brothers, Carman? Did that ever come into your possession?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2525s)

Oh, no.

No, it sure didn't. Because you see in 2001, and we actually have a little video about this, but in 2001, I believe Bruce Hales owed Roy Symington and he decided that he was going to have The King's Son back in the meeting.

But of course, bringing The King's Son back into the meeting, the same King's Son that never faced what he did, might have been more trouble than it was worth. But we could play the little video. Yeah, it's actually really enlightening.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2566s)

Well, go for it. I'm looking forward to it.

### [**Carman Drever (Video Voiceover)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2572s)

“What would it take to make you sell a little piece of heaven that wasn't actually yours to sell? I recently did a bit of research to understand what happened to the little piece of heaven purchased for and promised to Ken Symington's children.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered one half of it had been sold in 2006 by Roy Symington. Marketed as” a little piece of heaven” and sold to pay off a trail of court records publicly available from public data access. As this trail of documents play through the slideshow, imagine being told this man was so important to the PBCC, he must be restored to the church in his place as The King's Son. His family refused to have any part of it, remaining [away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2618s) from the cultic group. And so it was. The rules were changed in this highly controlling religious group and divorcees were now free to marry a second wife.

To clear his trail of debt and bad choices, he sold half of the property marketed as;

 “A little slice of heaven. Hidden Valley Ranch, located about six miles southeast of Walhalla, is owned by Roy Symington, a native of Neche, North Dakota.” The Grand Forks Herald [reads,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2648s) "One parcel includes a two-bedroom home with a full basement, several outbuildings, stables, and more.

"It's a gorgeous setting," says a Symington family member, who asked not to be quoted. The five wooded parcels totaled 416 acres. The six crop/pasture parcels total 584 acres. The Hidden Valley Ranch Land sale began at 10 a.m. September 30, 2006\. The farm equipment and hay sale with nine tractors, five trucks, ten trailers, and 2,000 bales of hay [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2686s) and ended the same day.”

 Could this trail of records explain why Roy A. Symington would choose to auction off this land to avoid a bankruptcy?

This land was purchased by Roy Symington with money he got from his father.

He took his nephew and went to his father to ask about buying this farmland to provide for Ken's children.

He explained this would be an investment into their futures.

His mother Beatrice explained the purchase of this farmland to Ken's widow and daughter at the time the purchase was made. She later reiterated the story in 1998 when she spoke to Rick and Carman Drever and turned over an envelope of letters written by Ken Symington while in the military.

James H. Symington told his son Roy, publicly, it was his responsibility to ensure Ken's children never lacked because of not having a father.

In providing the funds for this farmland, he put his money on the line to ensure this was the case. The remaining 1,600 acres remain in Roy Symington's name, awaiting the distribution of his will and testament. Will the PBCC do the right thing and turn this land back to the Symington children as was the purpose in the first place?”

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2769s)

Wow. So they don't provide for their own. They do not take care of their own at all.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2777s)

Take it, keep it, name it a little slice of heaven and sell it when you, when you get yourself in trouble.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2784s)

And is, am I correct in, did I hear that when Roy Symington passed, he specifically, specifically never left anything to any children that were outside the church?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2800s)

As far as I understand, that's how the will reads, yes. Yes. The land in question, the kids are not named, like my brothers or us are not named in it at all. So I'm assuming the land is actually still just in his name.

Nine out of a, nine out of twelve pieces he left in his own name. Three of the pieces he put into his and Rhoda's as in joint, but the other nine he kept in his own name. I don't understand the philosophy behind that. Maybe he was keeping his other slice of heaven in case things didn't work out. It's, it's, it's unique. It's a unique way to get married.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2844s)

Yeah, so to make it clear, when Roy was brought back into fellowship by Bruce Hales, his wife had left him at that point. Is that right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2858s)

Yep, that's correct.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2859s)

And he was kind of dragged back into fellowship. Everyone was paid off. And then Bruce Hales kind of married him off to Rhoda Markham, is it, who was a widow?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2871s)

Well, actually, no, everything wasn't paid off. He was brought back to meetings either at the end of 2001 or early 2002\. And his daughter got a phone call one morning from Roy at five o'clock in the morning, and five o'clock or seven o'clock in the morning, she told me, and it was her dad. And she was like, "Dad, what are you doing up at this time in the morning?" And he said, "Oh, I just called to let you know I'm going back to the church."

And she said all she remembers is she sat straight up in bed and she said, "What the hell did you just tell me?" And he said, "I just called to tell you I'm going back to the [church."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2915s) And Bea said, "Does Edie know?" And he said, "No, she doesn't know."

He made up his mind to go back to the church, just woke up one morning and he was going back to the church. And if you will look at all of those claims on that screen, if we had separated them, and those are all from 2001 until 2006\.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2948s)

Yeah, so for the listeners, inside that slideshow was, how many, how many things were up there of all of his misdemeanors and charges that were laid against him?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2960s)

And I think I only put 21 in there, but I believe there were somewhere either 26, 29, somewhere in there, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2967s)

And those were cases of him being like sued, right? For like...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=2970s)

Small claims court. Some were small claims court. Some of them were like, there's a misdemeanor for DUI, yeah. There's criminal trespass, there's livestock at large. There's so many livestock at larges that the final livestock at large was a $1,200 fine. I mean, there's a variety of different cases. There's a small claims one for $27,000, small claims for $24,000, and there's small claims from the lawyer that represented him [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3001s) the case before that, but he never paid to [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3003s) back and take him to small claims court to get the money out of him.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3006s)

What a piece of human, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3012s)

Uh, either 21 or 26 cases, don't know how many there are, but he was back in the meeting when those were going on. In 2002, in June 2002, he was on the front row of Detroit three-day meetings and gave an address and warned the young people in this address that if they even considered leaving the assembly, that would put them in an apostate position. This is a [man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3042s) who has 26 cases going against him, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3045s) he was worthy to be brought back to the fellowship because he was The King's Son. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3049s) his family would not rejoin him in fellowship. That was one of the main reasons none of them are fellowship today.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3056s)

But you realize...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3057s)

There's no hierarchy in there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3060s)

Yeah, no hierarchy. But the arrogance of the term "The King's Son." Whoa. That's some big ego right there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3071s)

So I mean, it's no coincidence that the time that Roy Symington was kind of dragged from his shack and set up in glory again was just around the time that Bruce Hales took over control from his father. I mean, I kind of suspect that John Hales probably wouldn't have taken that action because John Hales was more of a, you know, by that stage, John Hales was much more of a kind of a relatively [speaking,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3101s) straight up and down kind of guy.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3105s)

Well, John Hales went to the farm, because there was a lot of us that had objections to the fact that, well, first of all, Roy was supposed to be setting this farm up for the boys, but of course it was for himself. And there had been a lot of objection raised to the fact he had a $700 pair of crocodile skin cowboy boots and a multi-thousand dollar horse saddle in the barn. And so John Hales made a trip out there in like '88, '89. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3136s) it so happened that there were some of us on the other side of the wall when Mr. Hales was talking to Roy on the other side of the wall.

So we know he was questioning about his boots and his saddle and he just passed it off as it was just some farm equipment. His crocodile skin or rattlesnake skin, I don't remember which they were, his boots were over there, yeah. And that seems appropriate, thousand dollar saddle in the farm that he was supposed to be starting up for the boys that he coincidentally kept.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3166s)

And he didn't even buy with his own money. I mean, I think that's the shocking thing. He got the money from your grandfather on false pretenses, saying he was doing it for someone else, and in fact, he kept it all for himself.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3178s)

And took the young man with him for legitimacy to his [father.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3183s) Sorry, I don't mean to sound angry, but a little bit of it is just, it's so...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3189s)

Oh, honey, you are justified in having some human emotion attached to this.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3195s)

Yeah, take a young man, go ask for the money, "I'm gonna set this up for you," and then run off with it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3201s)

I think Bruce Hales really used Roy to his advantage kind of in a way because if I remember correctly, he brought Roy back right around the time he'd kicked out Jim DeSeyn and Lloyd Symington, who were big wigs, and Lloyd Paskewitz, sorry, Lloyd Paskewitz, that were big wigs and kind of could have been rivals, right, to Bruce Hales coming to power. And he kicked them [out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3231s) And then I remember the shock when Roy Symington came back and all of a sudden, boom, he was this big shot, right? So Bruce Hales was, I think he realized that he could, he could totally use Roy and, you know what I mean, and he would be loyal to him because he brought him back.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3248s)

Yeah, it kind of feels, the truth behind what you just said, Lane, is that Jim DeSeyn knew firsthand from Roy's kids what Roy had done to them. He also knew firsthand what Roy had done to my mom and so he stood in the way and was not bringing Roy back. [Oh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3266s) deduct from that what you want, but I'd say that your statement was pretty dead accurate. Yeah, yeah, it was Jim DeSeyn that stood in Roy, in, uh, Bruce's way of bringing Roy back, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3281s)

So Roy Symington kind of filled the vacuum because Bruce had kind of executed basically the two most popular and prominent leaders in the USA and he needed someone loyal to him to kind of fill that gap. And who better than someone with the grand name of Symington. So yeah, yeah, politically it was a very astute move. I mean, this is, this is Game of Thrones, isn't it? I mean, the maneuvers and the industry, it's always [Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3308s) of Thrones.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3309s)

And but I want to, I want to touch a little off topic here, but I want to talk about how the Brethren love their, their, their guys, right? Like their leaders, like the Jim Deseyns like people, the great men, and then the sub-great men like the Roy Symingtons and the Bill, whatever his name was, David Bill, I remember that name going around. It's a little bit homosexual, their bromance. It's nothing wrong with that at all, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3340s) they definitely, like the way that my dad would talk about Roy Symington, I wouldn't put it past my dad to, you know, kiss him or touch him. Maybe, maybe, you know, a long hug with a little butt grab.

There was definitely some, some, like some sexual bromance going on in the brother. Like I think if Bruce Hales was like, "I want a kiss," I think any one of the leaders, any one of the men around him, even if they were straight, would lock tongues with him in a second, right? I just think there's some, they love and [worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3379s) people. And what I would say if you're in there is learn to love yourself a little bit. You don't always need a hero to mold yourself after. You can actually just mold yourself any way that you want. And you can be content with yourself without being like, "I need to be like this leader because he does this," or "I need to be like that guy because he does this," right? Like some love for yourself and stop following these losers like Roy Symington, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3404s)

Yeah, and I think if, I think if these guys had ever actually seen Roy Symington, a day in the life of Roy Symington, they would have known better.

Yeah, and the guy had a temper. Let me tell you a funny story. He, I remember as a teenager, he come over to the house one day and of course he sent the boys to pick up Wes and Kenny and take them out to the farm. That was him taking care of them, you know, making sure that they had a dad close by and taking care of them and whatever. He sent his boys to pick them up and take them to the farm. And I don't know what it was that had happened, but he came over to the house. And first of all, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3447s) guy would park in the middle of the street, cockeyed, and leave his truck out there.

And he comes just marching up the driveway and you could tell he was pissed. And he gets the way up to the house and mom of course is protecting me and Cindy were inside there and I'm sitting up on the counter watching him out the window and sort of chuckling because obviously the guy's, I mean, he's like Rumpelstiltskin, okay? When he gets mad, he hops around from one foot to the other and he starts in on her. I don't [remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3477s) the topic or what he was yelling at her about, but he kept going, "We can't be having this, Marion, we can't be having this, we can't be going on like this," and sort of half whiny crying. And he went on and on and on until I saw the tears start coming down out of her eyes. And my little hind end jumped off that counter and I went outside and I looked at him and I looked him dead in the eye and I said, "Uncle Roy, you are enough to make a preacher swear." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3508s) he stopped and he chuckled and he beelined back down the driveway and drove off. We never spoke of it again. But that was Roy, classic Roy, come up to the house, start yelling and screaming, he jumps from one foot to the other. I mean, typical Rumpelstiltskin. Yeah, "We can't be having this, we can't be going on like this."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3529s)

Yeah, that was classic. It's so funny when you did that, like I just had these flashbacks of the way that Brethren members, priestly visits your mom, oh, and the grandmas were the worst. The way, you know, like these kind of this weepy, "Oh, you can't carry on like this," like it doesn't, carry on like what? Like they just go into these hysteric, dramatic bullshit that is so weird. I wish we could record it, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3571s)

Yeah, it's just, just embarrassing. Yeah, yeah, it is embarrassing.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3575s)

That was a widow, you know, that's, that's exactly how he treated her. And the other Symington guys, one of the other Symington brothers, he would probably know this story when I go to tell it, but he called her up one day and I don't, I honestly don't know, it was something trivial that happened and he was, I mean, he was furious. And I was sitting at the kitchen table, she answers the phone and he starts yelling and I mean, he is yelling and [carrying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3606s) on. I could hear it all the way across the kitchen. Of course she was overwhelmed.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3611s)

Huh? Who's he yelling at?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3613s)

My mom.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3614s)

Your mom, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3615s)

Yeah, and it wasn't, the funny part is, if I remember the story correctly, it wasn't even something that she had done. I mean, it was, she was working in the garden with his wife and something had gone wrong or she, or his wife got home late. It was something like that. But he's yelling and yelling and I can hear every word he's saying. And she starts, tears are streaming down her face. And I remember getting up. I walked over and I said, "Give me the phone." And she was like, "No, no, no, no, I can't do that." So I'm [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3646s) there. And I said, "You either give me the receiver or I'm going to push the button." And of course I've got the button and I'm standing the whole 50-foot cord length away. I'm like, "You either give me the phone or I'm going to push the button."

So she finally hands me the phone and I pop it around the corner in the, in the little front porch, set it on the washer, metal washer, phone receiver, man screaming down the phone. So you can hear him as I'm walking away and he's going, "Marion, the righteous are gonna roar as a lion\! Do you hear me? The righteous are roaring as a lion\!" And we sat down at the kitchen table and we died. I mean, you have [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3688s) laugh.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3689s)

Oh yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3690s)

That's how they treated her. And that's why she literally, when she was missing a check, that's why you don't even speak up. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3699s) The Symington animals are gonna come and they're holding that money over you. Yep. Oh my god. And that's how they treated her.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3709s)

No other church would treat a widow like this, like this. It's disgusting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3714s)

I know we're sitting here talking about a Christian church. Like when you sit and listen to this podcast and then you ask yourself, does this sound like something that would come out of a mainstream Christian church? Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3732s)

Christ-like.

The righteous roaring like a lion at a widow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3740s)

I believe the scripture...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3742s)

Says if you offend a widow or a fatherless child, it would be better for you if a millstone were hung about your neck and you tossed in the sea.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3755s)

Yeah, yeah, that's what it says.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3758s)

Yeah, I quoted that so many times growing up.

These guys, yeah.

So, and so we're talking about the 2000s when Uncle Roy is brought back and I told you that I thought Bruce had taken on more of a problem than he had an asset that was going to help him.

So over Christmas this year, I got a little present. Somebody sent me a couple of pictures and I think we're going to show these pictures, aren't we?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3789s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3790s)

This is my beloved Uncle Roy in 2004 when he took his nephew on an encouragement trip to Australia.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3801s)

Can you see it?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3803s)

Yep.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3804s)

Is that Roy Symington?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3806s)

This beloved brethren, inside and outsiders, is Roy Symington in 2004 underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge. And this man in this picture would be 60 years old. He's with Gareth Hales, Dean Hales, and Louis Symington drinking beer under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This is a front [row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3834s) brother, [under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3835s) a bridge. This is a front row brother at this point.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3840s)

Because Jesus hates bars.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3844s)

Yeah, there he is. There he is. Looks quite happy, actually.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3849s)

Well, he's got beer in his hand.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3851s)

Yeah, you know, I wonder if the brethren have any idea.

This guy was so important as a King's Son, he had to be brought back to the meeting.

He in fact, he brought Louis over there in the picture, Louis Symington, and he brought him over to Sydney, Australia on an encouragement trip and he gets all these guys together and he's underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge drinking beer with them. [Because,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3879s) now if that was my kid and I found out that, and Louie passed away the next year, about six months after this picture. But if I was the parents of those kids, do you know how livid I would be at the guy that took my kids under the bridge and was drinking beer in public?

There's Gareth and there's Dean.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3903s)

Because in the Plymouth Brethren world, you can't go to bars like normal human beings, so it's more Christian to go and get drunk in public under a bridge.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3915s)

So can you name the guys in this picture from kind of left to right for people who don't know them?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3920s)

Well, the one is Louis Symington, that's Walt and Sharon's boy coming from...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3924s)

Which way from the left?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3925s)

Right beside Roy, that is who that is. Right beside Roy is Dean Hales, okay? And then there's Gareth.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3934s)

It's the other way around, isn't it? Dean's the fatter one with a bulgy crotch.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3944s)

I'm going to take your word for it. Yeah, I think you're right. It looks like Gareth on the right hand side.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3950s)

I'm seeing it backwards, so you're good. But that's Louis and Louis passed away in 2005\.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3958s)

Okay, what were the circumstances there? Just...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3961s)

I, I don't remember. Okay, I don't remember. We had come to Tennessee already.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=3970s)

But yeah, but I mean, Brethren did that once in a while. Like it was more acceptable to go on like a Saturday afternoon because that's the only time, free time you literally ever have because they're working the rest of the time or at church.

And like, we would go to parks and have picnics with other Brethren members and drink there. And, you know, when I look back at it now, I realized that there was a lot of underage drinking that went on, you know, doing that, and a lot of drinking and driving, like a lot of drinking and driving went on.

But it blows me away, because it's just like, we missed out on doing normal things like just going to a, you know, a restaurant or something like that, right? Like it was, we always had to be outside somewhere, so you're affected by weather too, to do any outdoor activities. And going and socializing and drinking with other people was literally like under a bridge or a park or that was it because you're not allowed to do normal things. It's weird though, like thinking the leader of a church, this, or not, he wasn't the [leader,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4042s) but he was a big top dog, VIP, let's call him a VIP, is under a bridge drinking with kids.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4051s)

What I mean, just to make it clear for people who, you know, not been in the Brethren, Dean and Gareth Hales are the sons of Bruce Hales, where Bruce Hales is the current elect vessel, the current global leader of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And of course, Roy Symington is son of one of the previous elect vessels, one of the previous leaders of the church. So that little group you see under the bridge there is kind of the crown princes of the whole organization. These are right at the top [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4081s) the tree, and they are sitting like a bunch of hobos under the bridge.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4087s)

Not that there's anything wrong with drinking under the bridge. It's the idea that you, you are so, you think of yourself as these chosen people by the creator of the entire universe, chose us to be these special people, and drinking under a bridge.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4101s)

I mean, well...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4103s)

And I think I get a lot of story, sorry, I think we'll get a lot of stories back from young people that would have been shut up or withdrawn from for doing that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4111s)

100%. I can guarantee you that if I was caught doing something like that back in my days, you know, shut up immediately. Yeah. I want to give people the idea of this, the eliteness, like how they view Bruce Hales, what, how they view him. So they talk about him, like him being the more most purest person to walk on this planet since the [Apostle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4141s) Paul.

And that this man is so pure, he doesn't have body odor.

I was talking to everybody last night who gave me a lot of insight into how they view Bruce Hales. And I'm sorry, Bruce, I'm going to pop your little bubble right now, but you are not the purest thing to be on this planet since the Apostle Paul. I'm like, you can just take that off your resume right now and erase it because it is not true. And if you don't have body [odor,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4179s) you have some good deodorant. I'm like, you're not, I can guarantee you somebody of your weight and what you drink and with the liver that's in your shape, I'm sure you sweat and stink a lot.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4190s)

I can't help but draw the comparison between the no body odor and the rumor that North Koreans believe that Kim Jong-un doesn't pee or poo.

It's so similar, right? They literally, some people believe that Kim Jong-un doesn't pee or poo. If you literally believe that the creator of the infinite universe, literally countless stars, billions of planets decided that one human, one homo sapien would not have body odor, give me something better than that, right? Maybe has like, like no bum hole, right? Or he, he [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4233s) burps or he can breathe underwater or something cool. But no body odor, is that the creator of the universe's best, best work?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4241s)

Wow. And supposedly Bruce Hales has had an appearance from Jesus himself and has had a conversation with Christ and he knows the date of the rapture but cannot tell anybody.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4256s)

That's hilarious.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4259s)

So that's why, that's why he's been ministering that there will be no more Elect Vessels. Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4267s)

That's what they're taught right now, that there is good, the rapture is coming during his time.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4272s)

Yeah. Oh, that's so funny. Oh.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4275s)

And the reason for that is, is because he's the seventh elect vessel and seven is the perfect number. So.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4284s)

I mean. According to what?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4287s)

The reason why there probably will be no more Elect Vessels is your empire is going to come crumbling down and it's going to get rebuilt into something different. And you're not going to be a part of it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4299s)

These Men of God, right?

Like, let's think about it. If I'm the creator of the universe, right? And I'm looking down and I'm like, "I'm going to bless someone with being the perfect thing just under Jesus, right?" You'd think that maybe I could extend their life past like 70, 80 years old. Let's hit up 100, 120, right, to really recruit and build upon my teachings. But there's just been multiple Great Men and it seems to me that they die just like [everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4332s) else. Well, now, now if one of them, for instance, was born by immaculate conception, then we would have a case. Holy, we would have a great case. But it seems like they were all born, they came through a vagina like everybody else and they die like everybody else.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4353s)

I mean, does it not even say in the Bible that no one knows the time or hour, right? Like it does. Like so here again, do you see how they're taking what's written in the Bible? It's written in the word and they are taking a man's opinion over top of it. Right. Like it's just.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4371s)

They spend their entire lives waiting for the rapture. And it's like, that's a serious waste of your life. If your life is just to wait to get to this afterlife and eternal thing, like, what are you, why are you just waiting your whole life for the afterlife? Why not enjoy what you have? If God, not that I believe in them, but if God created this universe, shouldn't you be enjoying your time and learning the lessons that you're supposed to learn here? Or should you spend your [entire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4401s) time waiting, wishing, and crying for this guy to show up on a cloud to save just you and your friends? Come on, grow up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4410s)

I don't know. I mean, we all know supposedly he's gotten sick, his wife had a stroke, he's awaiting surgery.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4420s)

But he knows the time of the rapture. Yeah, okay. Sure. I have a question for my Brethren friends inside about the Bible. This is my Biblical Question, Lane's Biblical Question for the week. The creator dictates a book, but leaves out 165 million years of dinosaurs.

Why? Were they not important?

165 million years is not a short time. That's my question.

Send your answers in as an email to Get A Life podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4472s)

Anyhow, well, you know what, Carman, I think this story was very, very important to tell. I'm sure we're going to get a lot of feedback from it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4483s)

We will because he's such an idol in there. He was such a big idol.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4486s)

We get the feedback from it. And that's okay.

It was not, we didn't sit here to reveal all this to cause harm to any of his children. That was not the point. Carman, you said that clearly. I just want to reiterate it again. That this was about letting the other side of the story be told that most people inside, and I'm assuming a lot of ex-members don't even know. So I think it's just, it was a really, really important podcast to tell.

And I know we have continuations of stuff that we will dive into. And this is what we could fit in for today.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4527s)

Is it all right just to put in a little teaser to say that we do have in our possession some very, very interesting documents relating to the Symington family, which we are processing at the moment. So watch this space. This is, this is part one of a two-part series.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4543s)

And if you have details, if you have stories, if you want to submit, you know, your details that we missed out, send them to info.getalife@proton.me.

We'll add them to part two. We know there's hundreds of stories out there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4573s)

Yeah, you're welcome to come on and join us too if you want.

Well, thanks everyone. I know we have a lot in the bag right now. There is, there's a lot, there was a lot, we could have gone on for another two hours inside here with stuff that has fallen on our lap in the last probably 48 hours. And yeah, it is going to get very heated up. I'm very grateful, we are very grateful for all of the support that has been coming our way right now with messages and comments. It is super important. I'm [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4608s) gonna lie, I know myself personally, I rely on those. I really do.

I very much do. I am a very emotional person and I tend to get very wrapped up in all this. So it's very nice when we get the support that we've been getting.

So yes, anything else left to add, you guys?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okw-h38K2pc&t=4633s)

No, that's a pretty full session.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
