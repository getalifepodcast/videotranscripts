## Summary

Could you imagine waking up one morning and being told not to come to a church service and then finding out after someone had the power to play God with your life? Our guest Rob McLean lost his wife, 6 children, grandchildren and his business in a blink of an eye due to a priest that had it out for him. He was withdrawn from through the letterbox from asking a question about Aberdeen! The real reason was due to Rob making a comment in regards to Bruce Hales and it was reported to him. When Rob was in a larger community, he kept his head down and made the best of his life that he could. He had to transfer to a smaller community and that's when things went south. You will hear how dangerously horrific and evil this system is and how they take out Christ in every way and replace it with Bruce. Our hearts broke as Rob walked us through his recovery from alcohol from being in the brethren and how the medication Naltrexone changed his life. We dive into the situation well known to the ex brethren community when Braden Simmons had his house raided. Rob, living there at the time, shares the ferocious antics of the PBCC. After watching this podcast, you'll realize that somehow- we need to stop this bullying that destroys families! Noone should have the power to tear families apart.

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=10s)

Hello everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today with Carman, Richard and Lane and our special guest is Rob McLean from New Zealand, I believe.

We had a couple of requests to bring him on and I know he's got some holes that we can fill in with a part of Braden's story, but he's got his own story as well. So Rob, I'm just going to hand the mic over to you and if you want to just let our listeners and viewers know where you're from and what got you outside the PBCC.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=49s)

Okay, well thanks, Cheryl. So in 2009, I was living in Lower Hutt Church and that was a fairly small church that I'd sort of been moved to after living in Wellington all my life, which is a much bigger church. So we went from 400-plus brethren down to just over 100 brethren. This is the Lower Hutt church and the dynamics of a small church are very different from the dynamics of a big [church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=84s), and the personalities and everything have a big part to play, and people's egos and stuff like that.

So in 2009, I would have moved here in the early 2000s. And it just so happened that the dynamics of that church were that the only people older than me were basically stroke victims, right? So they weren't active members as such. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=114s) I sort of expected to be one of the higher, you know, front-row brothers, whereas in Wellington, I just kept my head down all my life. So the dynamics were very different. I was propelled from the basically from the reserves into the front line just like that.

And so in 2009, things were really toxic. I didn't get on very well with the leading guy who ran the place, who was an absolute brutal multi-millionaire, absolutely brutal, cruel guy. And unfortunately, the other guy that was propelled with him was my own brother, my younger brother, and they two were running the Lower Hutt church, right?

Now, I got on really well with my younger brother [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=166s) when we lived in Wellington, but when we moved to Lower Hutt, because he got this, he became number two in the hierarchy, he sort of turned against me, like just overnight, you know? It was just terrible. And the whole dynamics of the Lower Hutt was just, it was just like dog-eat-dog. It was just brutal stuff. It was toxic. There's no love in that place. It was just, and the guy that ran it was a brutal, brutal little [guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=197s). He was an absolute bully.

So what triggered all this was in 2009, Bruce Hales decided to print a whole lot of JT Jr.'s green books of 1970\. Okay, now his green books in 1970 were full of crap, right? And I had already read one or two of his 1970 books and looked, and I knew sort of basically what was in them. So I started reading these and I just couldn't get over it. And also, I knew I'd always ask questions about JT Jr. because [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=242s) I'd asked my father about it and it turned out that he was given an ultimatum. He had to either shut up or he'd be kicked out. And then I found out later that my father-in-law was given the same ultimatum because they both had inside knowledge directly from New York. So I already knew there was absolute dodgy stuff.

So I just couldn't help but read these books, and I just couldn't get over it. So I just started mentioning stuff to my wife and lo and behold, it got back to my flipping brother or his wife and the whole thing. I started getting visits from the priest and stuff like that. I started getting really disillusioned.

And what happened was one time, what [triggered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=297s) the whole thing after that was that we got invited to some meetings in the North Island. And that's me, and Bruce has to send a couple of brothers over to take those meetings. And then Bruce Hales was coming to the North Island to take meetings after that. And so I must have mentioned something to my family, "Oh, Bruce is sending his emissaries to soften up the place before he comes." And that remark [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=328s) back, and at that time, Bruce Hales must have been in the country, and that remark got passed directly on to Bruce Hales. Bruce Hales heard about it. I was in absolute crap, right?

And I heard a message back saying, because we had been invited to meetings in Whangarei with Bruce Hales after that fellowship meeting, and I heard Bruce Hales said, "I don't want him at my fellowship meeting." But we'd already been [organized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=358s) to go there, like with everything and people to stay with and flights and bus trips and everything else. So we went, but I didn't know that at the time that I was under surveillance.

And when we got to Whangarei, they said, "Oh, you've been changed, your host has been changed." And it turned out that they thought I was such a dangerous person, I'd be influencing this young host [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=388s) were being committed to stay with, I'd be influencing him against Bruce Hales or something. So they put us up at this other safe house. I didn't know that at the time. It was quite suspicious, actually.

But then we got back to Wellington, and oh, by the way, Bruce Hales is going on about, "Don't be an opposer." So basically, I knew he was getting at me, you know? So when we got back, we got some more priestlies, and then at the [end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=418s) of that week, like on the Friday, I came home from work, I said to my missus, "Oh, I can't take any more of this pressure, you know, getting rung up at work and saying, 'Oh, we want to come around to see you,' and blah, blah. I can't run this business well then, I've had enough."

And she actually took off with the two youngest kids and she took off down to my brother's place. And she must have been in communication with my brother or the priest all that time. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=449s) so she must have been told to get out of it. And the next morning, I got a ring saying, I think the next morning was a “care meeting” and they were having them at 8:00 AM in those days. And I got a ring from my brother to say, "Oh, we don't want you to come out this morning. We're going to be discussing your matters," which wasn't an absolute surprise to me.

So at that stage, my wife was at my brother's house and her two youngest kids were there, and my two other boys living at home, they went out to the church meeting. So at that stage, the guy that was running Lower Hutt church, I was not seeing at all. Like, I told him to piss off, I don't want to see you anymore. So I was being seen by another priest. So we were not on talking terms even at that stage, just give us, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=506s) such a bully.

So I just, what I did, so I went down and bought a newspaper and then locked all the doors and stuff and sat in the bedroom where they couldn't see me because I knew I'd get a visit after the meeting. And so I get a knock on the door, so I don't go to the door. And then I get a ring back saying, "Oh, we want to see you." I said, "Oh, just leave a note in the letterbox, thanks." So I went down and got this note and I just, I couldn't believe it. It said that they'd actually withdrawn from me on the spot. Like, wow. And like, actually, I just couldn't believe it.

And then shortly [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=543s) that, I get a ring from a guy in Wellington inviting us out for the break, and I said, "Oh, no." I had to tell him. I just still couldn't believe it. Hey, no, it's just like going around like a stunned mullet. And I was just, I just could not believe that they had withdrawn from me like that, just for that. They didn't even give me a second chance. And it turned out later, I heard from my family that the top brother [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=573s) said to the brethren in Lower Hutt that Rob McLean believed the lie about Mr. Jim. That's what he told the brethren. In other words, I've been going on and saying Mr. Jim was an adulterer, which I was not, which was not what I was saying at all. I was discussing his ministry. And that's why they withdrew from me, because I didn't have any choice. Now, that's how much that guy hated me. He wanted to actually destroy me. Yeah, okay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=598s)

Yeah, wow. I mean, that's an incredible story. And I mean, it's very relevant because I don't know if you noticed in that business with Lance Christie, that court case with Lance Christie, one of the things the brethren objected to was Lance saying that the brethren ran a kangaroo court, which is another way of saying, you know, there's not the proper process of justice. And of course, absolutely fundamental to any kind of justice [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=628s) due process is that the person has the right to a defense or to defend themselves. So for them to withdraw from you when they had told you not to be at the meeting, so you had no opportunity to answer to the charges, I mean, that's just fundamentally wrong and corrupt.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=646s)

And I heard the whole meeting was just absolutely shocked. And then I heard that one of my sons was so upset, he went and sat in the car. He was just so upset about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=659s)

That breaks my heart.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=660s)

But I didn't know at the time. It was only later I found this out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=667s)

So they didn't shut you up at all? Like, there was no shut up, it was just...

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=670s)

No warning. There was no warning system, right? And that's what stunned everyone. That's what shocked everyone.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=676s)

Do you think it was also because you said something about Bruce Hales, too? Like, do you think that trickled in?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=683s)

Yeah, that's why they would have, I think that's probably why they were going to shut... He probably told them to, I don't know, bring it to the assembly or something. I don't know what he told them. But so I was, and I don't know what the priests actually told Bruce Hales about me, but they might have told him that I believed a lie about Mr. Jim. I don't know, because the guy in charge, he wanted to get rid of me and destroy me.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=708s)

Yeah, and they do, they've done this so many times, right? Because as soon as they, exactly, it's because, and the only way that they, the reason that they can do it is because they have these kangaroo courts, like Lance Christie said. They have these things where, but the audacity of it, to think that these men can go and judge someone's life and then cut them off from their family, friends, life, and everything, just like that.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=736s)

Overnight. So two men, two elders in each locality report to Bruce Hales, and they're basically, they can play God with your life. Yeah, they can ruin your life and no one's going to, and they're not accountable. Yeah, yeah. And that's so wrong, hey.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=753s)

And oh, this just, it just, this just lights another fire. I see now why I was told to bring you on. This lights a fire in me. This is why we do what we do, because this has to stop. From some of the insiders that I've talked to, especially the male ones, is specifically this reason why they have to be so careful with how they're communicating with me, what they're telling me, all that kind of stuff, is they fear exactly what happened to you.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=778s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=780s)

Like, it's just, this is just not right. It's just not right that they get to have this kind of power.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=786s)

Yeah, and they just want to control you and teach you a lesson. And I just knew from that day on, they just wanted to break me, okay? And they thought I was easy meat. Now, so what happened after that, like I still, okay, because I never wanted to leave, right? I never had any intention of leaving. I just had questions. It was forced. I was never going to walk away from my family. But I'd opened the whole can of worms after that.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=816s) so basically, like I still had my own business. Like, I had a business that I'd run, started up with my father for 20 years. So I had three of my children working for me and a brethren office lady. And I still, so I was still running that business, even though I was excommunicated, because they were sort of, they said, "Oh, you know," because I wasn't, I didn't say I didn't want to go back. They knew I wanted to go back, so they didn't kick me out of the business at that stage.

So what happened after that is, like, I just got, so I was at work Monday to Friday, but then the rest of the time, especially the weekend, like I was just, like I went from having a full life, everything mapped out for me, a full program, to having nothing, right? It's like at the weekends and stuff. So I was at absolutely a loose end.

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=870s) the only person I could talk to outside the brethren, I didn't have any friends, was my GP. And fortunately, she is really good and supportive. And so basically, I started having, well, I just couldn't cope. And I started having panic attacks and acute anxiety and stuff because, and I thought all that time, I thought, "Well, how long am I going to be out for?" Because I knew, I knew if people had been out for three years and stuff, I said, "[No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=900s), I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to be out for a long time. I could be out for a long time." So I didn't want to get my hopes up.

But anyhow, so because of my anxiety and stuff, I started, I couldn't eat. I lost my appetite. And it came to the stage where I went to the GP and I lost so much weight, and she said, "I'll put you on this pill, on this thing that should help your appetite." And she gave it to me, prescribed it to [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=931s) one afternoon. And I took it straight away. I went back to work and I basically collapsed over, I was doing some photocopying, I collapsed over the photocopier in the office, and that was a shock. That really shocked everyone. And they didn't take me home, they just got a taxi for me. But the flipping taxi driver must have went to walk, they must have thought I was flipping drunk. Okay, I was wandering around like a drunkie.

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=961s) I collapsed on the bed at home and I didn't wake up till the next morning. But when I woke up, I thought, "Oh, I feel like eating some food." So it's like a wonder drug, man. So I really started, I started enjoying food again. And then at the same time, the priests must have got to hear about it and they must have got, they must have got the shits up, hey. And after that, they started bringing me meals at night, every night, they'd bring me a cooked meal, the priesthood. Whoa, crazy.

But then they said, "Oh, no," then they said, "Oh, that there's something about, oh, and you know, we're hoping you'll be able to come back soon," and blah, blah. They started to give me little hints. And I was just waiting on the Lord, "We're just waiting on the Lord," you know, blah, blah. And basically, just must be sent to Bruce Hales to see what to do about me and stuff.

But oh, by this time, I'd started making friends with people out there because I had to to survive. And my doctor had advised me, encouraged me to reach out to people and stuff. You can't live in a vacuum. So I'd actually started having a little life out there. But at the same time, I knew that I was totally, I was absolutely diametrically opposed to breaking up families. Like, that'd be my main hang-up all my life, as I knew breaking up families was absolutely wrong. But I never thought it was going to happen to me.

So in the [end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1059s), so they said, "Oh," so I got rung up one morning and said, "Oh, Rob, we want to come out, we want you to, we want to come and meet you. No, we want to tell the brethren at the last gospel that we want to bring you back. When can you stay around until then? Then if that's after that, we'll come and see you." And this is after 10 months, right?

And so this is what happened. So they came around after church or last gospel and came and picked me up and dropped me at home. It was meant to be a big symbolic thing, right? You know, "Here's Rob, he's absolute, we've [cracked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1100s) him. He's a, you know, he's a mental case and he's just, he's never going to cause any more trouble again." But I was really sad because my wife met me at the door and she, and it's all fine and dandy, and then she said to, she must have said to someone, "Oh," said to my brother or something, "Oh, he looks like a stranger to me." Like a stranger to me.

And it was true. Like, I'd been living 10 months, I'd been living a separate life to my wife and my family. I'd been [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1130s) a different track to them. And in that 10 months, I had learned so much. My knowledge had exploded so much because I was able to go to the internet at night. I went to the library and the, just to keep me sane, I went to the library and the airport, they had internet access. And I just, I just learned so much about things that I came back, just had a knowledge explosion.

And I came back and I was just basically, like, I was just absolutely a real [disillusioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1161s) guy. But I said to the doctor, I said, "What do I do? Do I go back or not?" And she, and we both agreed that I'd better give it a go, otherwise I'd regret it. So that's why I said, "I'll give it a go. I'll go back and see what happens."

But they basically got inside my wife's head, the priest, and basically they said, "If you have any concerns about Rob or anything that he says or stuff, you come to us straight away." And that's what happened. Like, everything I said, [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1191s) got back to the priest and it was just, it was chaos for me onwards. So I lasted for a year and then one Friday evening afternoon, I came home from work and said, "Oh, you know, better, maybe I'll go and stay at a hotel for the weekend. We'll see how we can sort this out, you know, see if we can, because everyone's not happy." And I was under a hell of a lot of pressure by the priest and stuff because I was meant to be a happy chappy, right?

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1221s) I wasn't a happy chappy. I was staying on, like we'd go to Wellington interchange, I'd purposely sit in that last row of brothers because I was just pissed off because I knew it was just so wrong. The whole thing was so wrong. And I couldn't even pretend to be happy. I didn't even want to look happy. Anyhow, so my wife agreed and I'd go away for the weekend, you'll see, try and see what the best thing was to do.

But straight away the next morning, I rang up the person, said, "Oh, I think I can sort this out. I think I know how to sort this out." And they said, "Oh, no, sorry, we want to come around to see you." So they came around to this freaking motel and the head priest said, "Oh, Rob, because you're shut up. So shut up and then I'll take you down, we'll find you somewhere to live, you know, some, [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1280s) got a mate of mine down the street that should have a bedroom for you or something." And that was that. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to my wife and family. So from that point on, I was shut up, okay?

And even though I still didn't want to leave, so I still tried to go back, right? I'm still trying to go back. So they got me this, so and then they got me some premises, a place to live by myself, this little house by myself. And I [lived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1310s) there for six months. I got visited once a week and they'd come and visit me and say, like, "What are you up to?" and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'll try and do my best. And I said, "You can't, you can't talk to any of your friends that you will be friends that you had, that you had when I was out, I was withdrawn from." So I didn't talk to anyone like that, didn't talk to them. I was basically in a vacuum again.

And so one time they asked me what I was doing, what I'd done. And I said, "I've been to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1340s) library." "Yeah, oh, you can't go to the library. Yeah, that's not a place for, you know, brethren to go to." Okay, so they stopped me going to the library. They were just, they were just looking for psychological abuse. And then a few days later, I saw this guy's wife at the library, you know? So let's go and brainwash me. Yeah. So basically, when you are, when you're shut up or withdrawn from, you're basically going through an intensive brainwashing [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1371s). That's basically what it is, psychological brainwashing.

So after six months, and I thought I'd get back, after six, I got my hopes up that I was going to get back, you know? I couldn't take much more of it. And then my place came up for, I had to actually move to another place. And I thought, "Oh, don't let me come back now, rather than have more premises." That didn't happen. And I thought, "Oh, I can't take any more of this."

So [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1401s) what I did is I still had a key to the garage door in my own house, it's my family home. So I went back there and stayed there for two nights in the garage. And I took a mattress and stayed there for two nights as a defiant gesture. And then I left my wife a note saying, "Oh," she left me a note saying, "Oh, please don't stay any longer. We can't go to the supper from here. We can't have visitors."

And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1431s) I left a note for my priest saying, "I never ever want to see you guys again." Yes, fired, you're fired. And at that point, they knew they'd lost me and I wasn't going back. And that same day, I bumped into an old friend. I went to an event in the Botanical Gardens in town, it was a music event. Bumped into an old friend and I got a message with another friend that I'd known, another mate, friend I'd known while I'd been out. And boom, I was back on track again. So I wasn't going into a huge vacuum.

But what happened was after that at work, they just started, my family started pulling back from me and they wouldn't let me make, they wouldn't let me in on any decisions or anything. They just froze me out of the business. They were obviously told that, and that was the idea. They were going to freeze me out of the business and squeeze me out. And I was in no fit state to fight them, okay? I was trying to run that business on my own, and it's not good. So it wasn't a good state.

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1503s) basically, at the end of the day, they got the business fairly by their accounts, and I got a pittance by mine. And basically, I was going to sell, I decided I'm going to sell some more shares, my 50 shares, so I'm going to sell that to my family. But what happened during that time is one day I saw these people coming around taking photos inside the premises where we had premises. And I said, "What's going on?" I rang the landlord and said, "What's going on?" He said, "Oh, don't you know? The family's moving out to premises, you know, this other guy." And it was my priest, my main priest, had huge premises. He had done a deal with my son, my oldest son, that when I left, when Rob McLean left, when he sold the business, you were going to [move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1566s) out into his premises, right? So they were going to be under his roof so he could observe them and so I couldn't cause any trouble.

Now, he'd done a legal deal with my son, signing him up for premises under my nose. So then when they got back to the lawyers, they basically panicked and they basically sold my shares at the price I'd had an ability and basically I got out as quick as good after that. But that was [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1596s) and it was bad, okay? Because I couldn't take anymore, because, fancy fighting against your own sons though in the business. I mean, I got on so well with my family and then it's forced, you're basically forced to fight your own family. Terrible.

But after that, like, I never thought of this, but like, you know how your job is like your reason to get out of bed in the morning? So I'd had this business, I'd built [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1626s) up from nothing, and to leave that business, and I had nothing. I had nothing to get up for. And I didn't feel like working. I just felt crap. Like, I just felt absolutely crushed down to the gutter after leaving my business. And I just couldn't work, hey. Life had, that was just my next big challenge. So I lost my wife, I've been married for 30 years, I lost my wife, six children, my grandchildren now, I lost my business. What else could I lose? Nothing.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1665s)

You know, it's amazing to do it as well as you are. That's a blessing. And that's incredibly tough what you went through. I can't believe they just put people through this over and over and over again. So what have you done since then?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1687s)

Well, I didn't do anything for a long time. I just didn't do anything. I used to go, to be honest, I had a, I found a nice restaurant on the waterfront and I'd just go there, an Italian restaurant, and I'd just go there during the day, while away time and drink cronies and look out on the water. Like, I just didn't know what to do with my life. I was just stunned. I was just traumatized.

And all this time, I was getting help from some drug and addiction services. Like, I did get help because that's one of the [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1725s) coming out of the brethren. Like, when I came out of the brethren, I was addicted to alcohol, right? Because that was the crutch, and that didn't help, right? No, it didn't help. And so I'd go through phases, I'd go dry and go back, and then, you know, I'd go through phases of like cycles and stuff like that. But I wasn't a hardcore alcoholic. It's just that I'd binge drink. I'd binge drink and once I started, I couldn't stop. And I'd always go back to my family and stuff. It was an emotional cycle.

And then I've had various part-time jobs. But I mean, like when you've been working for yourself and then you go and work for someone else, you really, unless you've got good management, you can have a really bad time. So and because I was coping with PTSD, like I didn't have a high tolerance for bad management and stuff. So I had, I basically have, I've had two part-time jobs since then.

And then more recently, I've picked up two days part-time work with a really [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1800s) boss, totally different culture. And it's really good. Like, I work from Lower Hutt and I'm basically my own boss. And this company's based in Christchurch and I do work from up in Wellington. And so that's working out really good. So that gives me structure in my day, two days a week. And the other two days, I do volunteer work with a local church, a local Baptist church, because I play guitar. So I do, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1830s) provide backup music and stuff, help out with that. The preschool, preschoolers meet up groups. So that's quite good as well. Yeah. And I'm actually retired now. So yeah, I've got plenty of time on my hands still.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1851s)

Well, we can find you some things to do if you're good at video editing.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1855s)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So what, I'll just, I'm going to tell you one more thing. Yeah, there's, I finally, three years ago, I went to Auckland. The reason being that I had, I got a protection order put on me. The local Hutt, the priests out in their heart persuaded my family to take out a protection order on me. So they did it through my older son and everyone's included in that protection order, all my family, all my children, my wife, my children, and my grandchildren, including that protection order. How about that?

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1901s) that's disgusting. That's just the grandchildren. That is, that is so evil, so evil. And how much lower can they stoop? A protection, excuse me. So I can't have any contact with them. And because I was starting to have a bit of contact with them and obviously they didn't like that.

And then I went to, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1931s) after that, I decided to go to, I was going to live in Auckland because I just wanted to get away from the place, from Lower Hutt, you know, because I didn't want to run into my family. So I went and went to Auckland and at the same time, I decided I want to get off, like I had some drink drives and because I used to drive myself around everywhere and I didn't want to have any more of those. And so I decided this was a time in my life where I wanted to get sober. So I went to Auckland. When I went to Auckland, I was going to live [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=1961s) Auckland. I went, booked myself into their drug and addictions services up there and they're pretty well run and got an appointment straight away with a clinical psychologist.

And I knew about, I knew there was two pills you could take for getting off alcohol, right? Now, I'm saying this for anyone that is interested in getting off alcohol. One's called Antabuse and that actually makes you physically ill if you touch alcohol. The other one's called Naltrexone, which is not so well known. And I didn't know, and no one ever recommended it to me. And they'd said to me that, "Oh, it's not as effective. It's not as kind of guaranteed it's going to work," and blah, blah, blah. I said, so I had eyes of, like, it felt like a guinea pig. I said, "I'm going to go on this Naltrexone and try it out and see if it works or not," because it was the least aggressive of the two pills.

Now, I'll tell you what. So basically, you're supposed to take this pill once a day. And so I took this [pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2024s), I took this pill for five days. But the first day I took this pill, I stopped craving for alcohol. I didn't want to have a drink. Wow. And it basically, and it basically takes away your pleasure thing in your brain that says, "Oh, alcohol is nice." And I'll tell you what, I've never ever touched a milliliter, a microgram of alcohol since. Good for you. It's the right time of life, hey. I've been on hard spirits all my life, bro. I need to stop this now.

And [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2062s) basically, I'll never look back, hey. Like, before that, I've been to AA and everything else and blah, blah. And then I'd go sober and then I'd go back to it and blah, blah. This time, so and I've never had to take any of these pills ever since. I've still got them if I need to, but I've never, I've never looked back. So I can go to a pub with other people or a restaurant, everything else, you know? I don't mind telling people I don't drink now. I don't know, I've drunk all my life, I don't drink anymore. And it doesn't bother me. That's, that's good. [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2092s) got traction on my life.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2097s)

Something that's amazing. I've never even heard of these drugs. I haven't either. That's, I'd heard of anti-smoking drugs that they helped you kick cigarettes because they helped kick that craving, but I never knew that they could do that with alcohol.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2111s)

That's amazing. Why don't they tell people? It should be readily available because it would help a lot of people, man.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2120s)

I'm glad that we're talking about this today because, I mean, you know, I suffered from alcoholism for years. It is, it's hard. It was a hard one to conquer. It really is. And like for myself, it's the same thing that I'm with, that it sounds like for you, Rob, is like, mine was an emotional crutch, right? It was, I went on those binges when I was just grieving what you're cut off from.

And I mean, my heart is just breaking for you. I'm trying not to cry. I just, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2150s) just think it's just horrific when we get these dads on here like you who have had to leave behind all their children inside, cut off just like that from them. Like, I don't, I just hope our listeners and our viewers understand like the horrificness of just, boom, one day you wake up and your life is taken away from you. It's just not right.

And it is why, I mean, I've just had emails again recently of like reasons why, you know, we shouldn't really do what we do. I mean, they're very few and far between, but I always like to reiterate when I have a moment like this, this is why we do what we do, because this has to stop, right? This is not right. This isn't right what Richard has to sit in, it's not right what you have to sit in. It's not, this isn't right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2201s)

What if, what if you think about it like this? Like, think of all the movies that are made about a guy who gets his daughter kidnapped or son, you know, murdered or something, and he goes on a rampage and gets vengeance, right, for something done to their family. And how many, how many dads would do anything for their families, right, to protect them, to save them? But what do you do when someone [brainwashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2231s) your child to not even want to speak to you? That is, you, what can you do? What do you do?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2238s)

Yeah, we've got, I think we've got to raise public awareness, too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2242s)

100%.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2243s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2244s)

And that it is, it is through the voices of everybody who has been a part of this coming forward. I'm just so grateful you came on, Rob, today. Like, this is such an important story to get out there. It's so important for everybody who's been in this situation. It doesn't have to be all this sexual abuse. It doesn't have to be that. Everybody's story is so important to be told in just the separation factor, right? Like, a family should not be split [apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2274s) by somebody else's decision in a split second. It shouldn't happen. Nobody should be having, nobody should have that power, nobody should have that power anywhere on this globe.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2284s)

And if you're in the church right now, realize that this could happen to you. You could get on the wrong side of Bruce Hales and be kicked out and cut off from your family just like that, overnight, like Rob was.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2299s)

Yeah, well, when I was initially withdrawn from, I wrote to my wife and kids, but I wrote to my wife and said, "Do you realize that the brethren are just, it's just part of life that breaking up families and separating husbands and wives, it's just part of life. It's just a normal, the brethren think it's a normal thing. It's an absolute normal thing." I said, "It's absolutely not." The brethren have been brainwashed into this and desensitized. And it's totally, it's just not, it's not a right thing.Lane Admiraal

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2338s)

And it's not normal in the world. I want brethren members that are listening to understand that when we tell our friends in the real world about our families and how our families refuse to speak to us, they're horrified. People don't do that out here unless maybe your child's a murderer or a drug addict that is homeless and can't find you. But people don't do that. That is not normal.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2367s)

They're right out of sync with society. Yeah. And I mean, this Royal Commission that got all the affidavit after affidavit, they can see that. And whether the government will do anything about it is another question, but they're going to send a report to the, the report's got to go in by June to the Governor-General, to the government, by June of this year on all the, on all the religious [abuses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2398s) in the state and faith-based institutions, including the Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2406s)

This will, this will be an amazing report and I hope that we can get it published.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2418s)

I just wonder, of all the cults that there is, is there another cult that attacks a marriage like the brethren do? That attacks, attacks like marriage, you know, marriage is supposed to be precious. But I just, it shocks me to believe how much they separate. Like, it just seems to be every day they're influencing a wife against a husband, and that's just [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2448s), I know, I know that Jehovah's Witnesses do it to a certain extent. They shun people. Yeah, like, I think for the amount of breakups there are in the Exclusive Brethren, I can't think of any other.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2465s)

I agree. I don't, I don't think there's, and I have not heard of anybody who can do it with the power that the brethren do. Like, just overnight, you're in and then the next thing you're right out. And I think the part that is the most damaging in there is this belief of always having the man of God on top and the church second, and then family comes underneath, right? Because that's how it works. If you want to look at the hierarchy, we [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2495s) the man of God, and then it's the church, then everything else comes second, then man.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2502s)

And then women. That's how they look at it, exactly right. Like, it's, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2505s)

And that's how they're able to come in and these wives don't question, the children don't question. Because I did an interview with a journalist yesterday and he asked me, he came out and asked me, he's like, "Why do you think people stay? Like, why do you think people stay in this kind of abuse and allow this to happen?" And I said, "Because you have to understand, you were raised in this. Your brain is completely developed in this [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2536s) belief and this system of the man of God is first, the church is protected, everything else comes after." So you, your brain to think like that. So in your case, Rob, when somebody shows up and it's like, "Hey, you can't go to care meeting," and then you're withdrawn from, of course, the wife wouldn't, I mean, obviously, she's probably sad, the kids are probably sad, but you can't express that. You automatically know that this must be what has to happen.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2565s)

You know, it's just not right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2568s)

Like, something has to break through. There has to be something somewhere in some country where we can get this started, where this is just, it's stopped. It has to stop. My heart is like literally just...

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2584s)

In the church, natural relationships mean absolutely nothing. Yeah, yeah. Okay, what they've really done, there's no compassion. It's dangerous.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2597s)

They say that your link with Christ is above all, like your family. And when they say that, that's also code for your link to Bruce Hales and your love to him, right? Your love to the man of God, the leader of the...

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2609s)

Everything's, everything's in Brethren speak. Yeah, you know, I was thinking the other day about the Japanese kamikaze in World War II. Yeah, they were flipping fanatical. They would do anything for the emperor, right? Yeah, anything. Now, look at the Exclusive Brethren. They are dangerous, very dangerous. They're being brainwashed from birth. They will do anything at the moment.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2636s)

Yeah, that's absolutely true.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2638s)

Yeah, they're a hair, they're a hair away from fundamentalist and and committing violence, right? They're a hair away from from committing violence, I think so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2646s)

Here's the thing, what gets really tricky in all this is when you've got, when there's a vengeance that happens inside there. So exactly what you explained with, you know, that priest that was trying, he wanted you out. That's what happened with our family in Maple Creek, where I mean, there was this long-standing vendetta with Morris Hope, with his dad had against my grandpa. Then they pass away, it gets just passed on down.

And when there's someone who has that type of power that has a vendetta [against](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2677s) a certain family, they stop at nothing, absolutely nothing. People ask me, like, therapy, therapy-wise, all my therapy, and I'm like, "You know what? 90% of my therapy, I had to get through what happened to me and to our family first before I could tackle what I'm tackling now." Because it is there, I can't even explain. So when you talk, Rob, I feel it. I feel it, how horrific it is when you have somebody with power that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2707s) out to get you. It's just, it literally feels like you are in prison within your own home. You're in prison within your own town. You're in prison with absolutely everything, especially when you're in a small community. There's no way out.

I mean, it's just, it's hard when you're up against that because the brethren, "Oh, well, you know, that's not happening," when you know exactly that's what's happening, right? It's a vendetta that's being played out. Okay, we're back. That's some connection issues there. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2737s) not sure where we were.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2740s)

Yeah, Rob, you were saying, what were we talking about?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2745s)

We were, we really were talking, we got into the charity commissions, or that commission's report that was going on. Anyhow, let's just kind of divert over to something that we wanted to talk about. We wanted to talk about, you witnessed something happened that was at Braden's house, or was it a, how did that go down?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2770s)

So when I was living in Auckland, I stayed at Braden's for a bit, Braden's house. Okay, and he had a, he had another boarder there at the time, and she was from France. She was just there temporarily, and she was, I think she was waiting to get a flight back home. It was just before COVID, actually, I think. Anyhow, so one morning, seven o'clock one morning, I had this knocking on the door, and I think my bedroom was closest to the front of the house.

And so I looked out the window, and I was like, I'd been asleep, and there was all these, all these important people standing on the front lawn in suits and stuff, like black men in ties. And they said, "Oh," and then they said, "Oh, are you Braden?" I said, "No." And I said, "Oh, are you Rob?" And I didn't say anything. And so by that time, Braden had woken up, and so he went and opened the door.

And the guy that was presenting the papers said, "You know, want to come in and give you these [papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2856s) and stuff." It's big, and like, Braden obviously didn't want to do anything, didn't want to let anyone in. But I think he rang his lawyer and asked him what he should do. And so his lawyer said, "You know, this is what it was." He had managed, this lawyer, barrister, whatever he is, had managed to get a high court order signed to basically search Braden's premises, which is pretty weird. So there's no police or anything involved. It's just lawyers. And including the, very fishy it was, that this is how the brethren operated.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2897s)

Yeah, they've done it several times, several times.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2902s)

Yeah, so they had a private investigator searching through everything, and we were there for quite a while. And they flipping, they had to turf the French girl out of her room as well. Well, that's quite horrible, too, hey? Had to wake her up and ask her to get out of her room and stuff. We were waiting around the lounge and stuff. I was really angry about the whole thing. So I just, I just videoed it. I just went around and videoed what they were doing.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2933s)

And then it's a huge misuse of law, right? Like, it's, they're absolutely abusing the law. Like, that shouldn't be allowed because they obviously couldn't get police to do it, right? So they had to try and use lawyers to try and get the search thing. And the funny thing is, is what were they exactly searching for? They're trying to get dirt on Braden. Yeah, and but wasn't it something silly, Richard, like contact lists or something?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2964s)

Yeah, I don't know exactly. I don't know exactly what the detail was. But yeah, I mean, the irony is, you know, you just had Lance being dragged over the coals, dragged into high court by the Brethren for harassment. Well, I mean, what's harassment if it's not getting a whole bunch of lawyers in suits and ties to search through your house? I mean, wow, that's harassment.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=2986s)

And we know that there's nothing cool about the Brethren. Their ministry books, nobody wants them, right? So we know that it's harassment because there isn't possibly anything cool that you could keep from the brethren that anyone in the world would want.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3002s)

They're not, they're certainly not cool and they're certainly not hot.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3008s)

I mean, they make a good wiener roast, although the pages are so light that they get stuck in your hot dog. It sucks. So they went through all of Braden's computers and hard drives and everything else and downloaded them onto a remote server because they had a computer expert there as well. And then they said, "Oh, they have to search my computer as well." I said, "Oh, no, I'm going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3038s) ring the police about this." So it's just been pretty difficult. But Braden said, "Oh, no, don't cause any trouble." And there's no point. So I watched them, videoed them going through my computer as well. They weren't very serious about that.

But then at one stage, we found out that the, oh, Braden's, at one stage, Braden decided to lighten the whole thing up and started, he played his electronic keyboard. So electronic, you know, so he started playing his keyboard and we played all these old, old tunes. And I got my guitar out and we were playing away. And we got the computer expert, turned out he was a computer buff, a guitar player as well. So he got playing. So he videoed all that as well, just to light things up. That's [hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3086s).

After about three hours, but like, it was quite, so just, and during that time, Braden rang his father and said, "Oh, what was happening?" and wouldn't be, he'd be late to work. So his father came right around because his father was in the church at that time, right? He wasn't shut up or anything. So he came round and I ended up having a jolly good talk to him, which wouldn't normally happen because I was a persona non grata. Yeah. Absolute opposer, arch-opposer. But anyhow, that's what happened there. And so I supplied all that to Braden for his evidence, video evidence.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3130s)

Wow. So did the court document actually give them the right to look through your computer or not? Or were they just kind of stretching it?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3139s)

They just said, "Search all the electronic equipment on your premises." I'm sure I could have, I'm sure I could have dug in and said, "No, it's outside the thing." But yeah, the thing is, like, the Brethren's lawyers had to go through some absolute archaic pieces of British law, yeah, to find a loophole and stuff that they could use so they could search Braden's premises. Like, it's pretty weird, huh? Like some Russian [spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3170s) or something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3171s)

Yeah, it's called an [Anton Piller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Piller_order) raid after the original case it's based on. Yeah, apparently it's very difficult to get in Canada. Canada's got better protection. So, I mean, I kind of think that's probably what the brethren were wanting to do to me all this time they were chasing me around. But I think they were told that, "Look, you'll never get a grant to do this." And that's when they kind of changed their plan and said, "Well, we can't do this legally, let's just sort of go in and, you know, lock the guy out of his house and steal his equipment," or whatever they were planning. But it's [crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3207s) that that would be allowed in a sort of modern democracy. You'd never think it was possible, but you know, they got enough money and they got big enough lawyers and they can actually do this kind of crap.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3218s)

But it's interesting that in New Zealand at the moment, the brethren are really soft-footing it because they know they're being investigated. Yeah, yeah. But they're really, they're not doing anything, they're not doing anything intrusive or litigating or anything else.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3237s)

Yeah.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3238s)

Well, I mean, they're losing this case, you know, going against Lance and losing that, it's going to make them even more soft-footed.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3244s)

Hopefully, because that's a black eye.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3247s)

They'll never tell any of their people inside that they lost. They'll just, that's right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3247s)

We'll tell them. Well, that's exactly one side of the story in there, and it's a very distorted side of the story. 

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3261s)

But I heard in New Zealand, they're not even shutting people up at the moment because they're too scared in the eyes of the commission. That's freaking well abuse. Yeah, yeah, it's psychological abuse.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3274s)

It is. Yeah, yeah. And we need laws, we need protection laws against it, and we need to expose it more, and we hopefully will get some justice.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3282s)

I think abuse of all types needs to be, yeah, become illegal. Because as I understand it, New Zealand is the only commission of inquiry into abuse that's included all types of abuse. In the UK and Australia, they need sexual abuse, but in New Zealand, that's all types of abuse. So that's where the, that's why the brethren got involved pretty much. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3312s) Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3315s)

It is hard, though, like just talking from insiders who aren't going to meeting and aren't shut up, that when we talk about other types of abuse, they get every other type of abuse along with it. And that's the hard part is because they're trying to hide behind this, "Well, we're not shunning this person. This person isn't shut up," but everything else is still happening. And that's what really needs to be. The brethren just have such a sneaky, sly way of trying [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3345s) get behind what they're supposed to be doing, right? To correct these things, but still keep all the abuse happening in behind.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3357s)

I mean, it's what's called constructive dismissal. I mean, if you've got an employee that you don't want to actually fire because you'd have to pay him some, you know, pay him some compensation, then what people will do is they'll make the employee's life so unpleasant that the employee resigns and then they don't have to pay him off. And the brethren have got that to a fine art.

So, I mean, it was kind of the same when I left that because the charity commission thing had all happened in England, they were very reluctant to actually sort of formally have [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3387s) meeting and withdraw from someone. So they just make your life hell until you walk out yourself and then they can say, "Oh, well, you know, we didn't want him to stop coming to church. He left of his own volition." But they shall make it, they shall make your life hell until you do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3404s)

Since you've been out, Rob, like, have they ever tried making amends with you? Have they ever tried being, I can't remember when the review happened. Like, were you, was the review around that time or was it later? I think it was later, wasn't it?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3418s)

The review was in the early 2000s. Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah, thing came to power. And talking about that review, they said, "Oh, we acknowledge past mistakes we've made. We've made mistakes in the past, right?" So they put these things right because they made mistakes. What they've never acknowledged, of course, is the big, and this is the elephant in the room, is the biggest mistake they made of all is their flipping, not, they're going against [scripture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3448s) and breaking up families. Yeah, that's what they should not be doing. Then they would never not have to have reviews if they stopped breaking up families.

But they're still, "Oh, we've made, we've not, it's past mistakes." We're still making this huge mistake, but we don't talk about it. Yeah, nothing's going on, breaking up, wrecking families and making people's lives a minus and misery, you know? Yeah, yeah. They want to be known as a mainstream Christian church, but they've removed Christ out of it and [replaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3479s) it with Bruce is what they've done.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3481s)

Well, they're probably a mainstream Bruce-tian church, aren't they?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3484s)

Yeah, yeah, that would be a better name for it because everything focuses on Bruce. Like, they've completely removed Christ out of it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3492s)

If you look really into cults, they're a mainstream cult.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3498s)

Yeah, yeah. There's nothing Christian about it. Like, they might as well dump the Bible, too, because they don't follow it. They don't read it. They don't apply it. No, they don't go, I think.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3509s)

I think that they have to have separation, though, because if they didn't, right, and if they allowed families to contact and everything, people would just leave. Oh, my goodness. Because all these family members like us, okay, all of us that would go and hang out with our families if we could, if they would allow us to, right? We would be such an example of happiness and joy and being happy that they'd be like, "This doesn't make sense," right? So they can't allow that because it would just expose what hypocrisy that they live.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3544s)

Yeah, destroy the illusion, wouldn't it? They destroy this lie that, "Oh, everyone who leaves, you know, they have this terrible, miserable life." Yeah, I mean, the separation is not to keep the world out, the separation is to keep the brethren in. That's what the walls are for. Exactly.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3563s)

It's the only layer of protection that protects Bruce. Well, yeah, what you said before, Cheryl, about your parents and a family vendetta and stuff, that is what the brethren are all about. Because you're born into this system from birth, no one joins it, no fresh blood that goes back generations. And what do you get when you've got a closed system like that with finite amounts of bloodlines? What do you get? That people that all this [hatred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3599s) and animosity and stuff like that, people fighting and devouring one another. What else can you expect? Yeah, it's just like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3606s)

Game of Thrones, isn't it, basically? But not so much sex.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3607s)

There's just no balance. There's nothing to keep it, not so much...

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3617s)

Basically, every generation's getting more and more extreme, inward-looking, and more removed from society. Yeah, and I mean, more interrelated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3624s)

And you hear about that through the principles and teachers that have reached out to us from OneSchool Global, right? With what they're witnessing. And I mean, some of the stuff that they're witnessing, I mean, it's just horrible. And it's all based, every single person that comes forward, you ask them, "Okay, well, what is this like? What do you feel is the issue here?" And it is, it's hierarchy. It literally comes down to the bullying in the school, comes down to the hierarchy within the families.

Right. Those vendettas just get kept on passing down, passing down, and passing down. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3659s)

You know, I don't know why I was just thinking this, but another sad thing about the brethren is the brethren that especially live in smaller localities, they would call them, right, or smaller cities, because you're not allowed to have friends outside the church. So you sometimes only have like two people your age in the entire thing, and you are limited and not allowed to make any other friends outside. So you know, you're just so limited in there into how many people you can even interact with. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3690s)

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3690s)

Well, yeah, that's the thing is with that, like, I went from a big locality to a small one, so I can see what you're saying. But in a big locality, like say Sydney or whatever, you can flip and you can have a massive social life. Like, I had a massive social life when I was living in Wellington. I just kept my head down. I just kept my head down and just enjoyed life the best I could. When you go to a small, if you're born into a small meeting or you move to a small meeting, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3721s) flipping can be really nasty, eh? Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3723s)

Yeah, and in a small meeting, you can't get away from those people who are tormenting you. In a big meeting, you don't have to interact with people you don't like. In a small meeting, it's cabin fever. It's like being locked up in a small hut with 10 people that you hate their guts.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3740s)

It's not healthy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3741s)

No, it's not. Because they see them every single day, 365 days a year. You're never learning about any new culture. The biggest culture shock to a brethren person is when they go from North America to Australia maybe or something, right? Like, they just have no friends outside anything. So they have no, they're just boring, I guess, is what I'm saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3771s)

So for our listeners that are and viewers that are listening in right now in the Plymouth Brethren Crazy Cult, I'm going to use James's term from now on, he calls it the Plymouth Brethren Crazy Cult. So you can't have special friendships. It's like, exactly what's happened with me. It's literally why I got all the priestly visits I did was because of the special friendships. If you end up hanging out with someone over and over and over and they see that you're developing a special bond, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3801s) considered a special friendship and that is not allowed. So you are not allowed to develop a special bond with somebody that, I mean, and I mean, you sit back and you look at that etiquette and rule that they have, it's the perfect way for you not to be able to rely on somebody, right? It is, it's like everybody, they just got to keep their head up and it's just Bruce Hales and the church up here.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3824s)

Yeah. Think how sick that is. You're not allowed to have a real human connection with a friend. You're not allowed to make a friend. That's your voice.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3838s)

Bruce Hales instituted a purge soon after he came to power about special friendships, and everyone had to have previously some mass and public confessions about all the special friends I had.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3851s)

I remember my dad being upset about that because we had these guys that would come in for business trips and they got along with my dad, so they'd stay in our house every time, right? And when this came out, it sucked. We all of a sudden started having to have over these families that we really didn't like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3868s)

I didn't realize he enforced that. Of course, I was gone by then. So what, was he just went from locality to locality and everybody had to get rid of their special friendships?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3878s)

No, it was more like, if it was just like, if they were noticed before, you just had to kind of stop, right? Like...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3891s)

I gotcha.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3891s)

You know, the crazy thing is that like the leading brothers in every locality, there's always the big cheese and then there's the big cheese's little sidekick who trots along after him. I mean, you know, it's a very obvious special friendship. You know, "You lick my butt, I'll lick yours." And yet, these are the people who are kind of going after the teenagers because they actually spoke to the same person twice the same evening. I mean, the hypocrisy of it.

And look at the top of the brethren. There's this little tiny clique of big cheeses, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3923s) you like. I mean, the whole core of the brethren management in Sydney is run on special friendships. Yeah.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3930s)

Yeah. But they don't really have to keep it that way. That's the only way you can control it. You know, you let anybody else in there and then you don't have control of the information.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3940s)

It's the same as a leader putting down their opposition party. You know what I mean? He makes sure that no one else is allowed to have special friendships except his special friendships, of course.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3950s)

Right, because he feels threatened. I mean, if you get a few people getting together and agreeing about something, then he's threatened because, you know, these people might agree that Bruce is not actually the best thing since sliced bread.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3964s)

I'd say anyone that leaves needs to get counseling.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3967s)

Yes.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3968s)

Because that'll help you see things from a rational perspective. Because once when you're there, you're emotionally all that stuff, because in there, nothing's rational.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3979s)

No, I mean, the whole system's built on lies. And so when you start to see the truth, you find everything you believe starts to crumble, and it's very, very traumatic in your mind.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=3992s)

Yeah, yeah. You have to have something to hold on to. And sometimes in my personal experience, you know, a therapist was that guiding hand that I needed to go back through some really dark shit, right? And yeah, like I would say that, too. Like, definitely counseling is...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4014s)

Yeah. Yeah. It's so important. I'm going to ask you a hard question and you don't have to answer it if you don't want to. But we know that the insiders are watching these. What would you say to your children and grandchildren if they watch this? What would you want to say to them?

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4031s)

I'd say I love all of them very much and I hope to see them one day.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4037s)

Yeah, yeah. There has to be change. There just has to be. This isn't right. This isn't how it should be. I've always said that lately, that Bruce Hales doesn't have a broken system, he has a system that works the way he needs it. It's up to everybody else to, for them to realize that it is a broken system and it only, it only benefits him, right? It's not benefiting anybody else [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4068s) him.

Yeah, but well, Rob, we are very appreciative of you coming on today. I don't even know what to say. My heart just, my heart just goes out to you. I know it's, I know it's hard coming on here and bringing it all back up again, but I know many insiders are watching these and it's very important, especially for those like yourself and Richard, to be able to [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4098s) your story because it is, I can't even explain to you how many fathers I get that message that want to leave, but are waiting. They're waiting for something to change, right? They're just waiting and it's sad. It is really, it's hard. It's hard sometimes talking, it was hard sometimes listening to what they're saying and writing. And because I just want to go in, I just want to, I just want this all to stop, right? Like, it's, but it's not that easy.

And it's the courage of people like you and everybody else who comes on here and tells their heart-wrenching stories that people inside there relate [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4139s), and that is the biggest thing. I think everybody in there looks for is, they want to be able to relate to us and to realize that we haven't broken. We're still standing very strong in our decisions. But it is, it does take a lot to transition. It really does because you're leaving one world and you're entering into freedom, and that's hard. It's hard to do that.

### [**Rob McLean**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4167s)

Yeah. So thanks for having me, Cheryl. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you, Rob. Yeah, thanks.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwncaoOJZi0&t=4173s)

Everyone for joining us again and until next time, much love to you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
