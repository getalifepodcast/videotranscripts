## Summary

Markâ€™s story is one of quiet courage and transformation. In 1975, he left the Exclusive brethren, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. This was not something he planned or had wanted. He was given no choice in the decision. Stepping away from such a community meant not only redefining his beliefs but also rebuilding his life from the ground up without the support of family or lifelong friends. What was the reason for withdrawing Mark?? He simply wasn't fit for Christianity, says the Exclusive Brethren members!
Since then, Mark has navigated a path marked by resilience, curiosity, and a deep commitment to personal growth. He and his wife were able to adopt 2 children, something that isn't allowed inside the cult. Join us as Mark explains how he has navigated his journey to find acceptance with events of 50 years ago, including the infamous review where they showed up on his doorstep! Mark shares his story not to dwell on the past but to offer insight, hope, and understanding to others who may be questioning their own paths or seeking connections beyond the boundaries of the PBCC.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3s)

I would really describe Jim Symington as being a bully. He bullied the brethren. Anybody that came up against him, he just exercised his authority in a very nasty way.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=21s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=23s)

And it was a very brief letter. I haven't kept it. I wish I had actually, but I haven't got it. But one of the lines said that we had been withdrawn from because we were no longer fit for Christian fellowship. So there was no specific issue that we were withdrawn from. They didn't say you're guilty of this, you're unrepentant of [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=54s) It was you are no longer fit for Christian fellowship.

I mean, I think if adoption was allowed amongst the brethren, they wouldn't stand a chance because the adoption people would not accept that way of life and the intense indoctrination of children.

What gets me at times is the injustice of the world. It's not just about me. It's about many, many other people. The injustice was dreadful.

I think you'd have to examine your loyalties. Are you loyal to Christ or are you loyal to a system?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=130s)

Hello everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We're back with the UK team. I'm Jacky and I'm an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren who now call themselves the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. I'm joined by my friend Ross.

### **Ross Turner**

Hi, I'm Ross, I'm from Peterborough.

### **Jacky Hart**

Hello Ross, and also joined by our other friend Gilli.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=154s)

Gilli from formerly Birmingham.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=158s)

Yeah, and our very special guest tonight is Mark Storry who's from Nottingham. And Mark wants to tell his story of how he left the Brethren. So Mark, we'll hand over to you and start at the very beginning. Tell us what happened to you and your story with the Exclusive Brethren, or Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, as they're now known.

### **Mark Storry**

Well, thank you very much, Jacky and Ross and Gilli, for allowing me to come on your show. So the [reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=188s) why I wanted to share my experience was that in many respects, our situation, when I say our, I mean my wife and myself, our situation was very much different from the majority of those that have left in as much that it wasn't our intention to leave. And for a period of time, we did try actively to try and get back into fellowship.

And I'm sure there are a number of people who listen to the podcast who have probably gone through a similar experience to that, who they didn't want to leave but they were thrust out. And so just to give a little bit of background to my life, I was born in the 1940s. I know it doesn't look like it, but I was.

And my parents were very godly people. I'm extremely thankful for the way that they brought me up in the Christian faith, particularly my father. And so my experience really began in terms of Christian faith and being amongst the brethren during the 1950s before the troubles and separation that came in in [1960\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=280s) And I'm very thankful for that early start in my life. And during that period, in the late 1950s, in the church in Nottingham, the Plymouth Brethren Church, we had a series of what I would call special preachings spread over three Saturdays.

And [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=311s) were encouraged to bring friends and family and other people to these events. And I remember that in the meeting in Nottingham, we had a school teacher who brought her entire class of young children to this gospel preaching. And so that just gives an idea of what was happening during the 1950s.

### **Jacky Hart**

That's quite [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=341s) because it correlates, obviously not with my memory, but my mother joined the Brethren about that time and she often speaks of how what she joined was different to what the Brethren then became in her opinion, but obviously then it was a very open church. Would that be a way to describe it in the 50s from what you're saying?

### **Mark Storry**

Oh, yes, definitely so. I mean, you know, apart from things like television and radio and maybe going to the cinema [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=371s) things like that, we were free to mix with society and people were encouraged to come to what we called the gospel preachings. As I say, we had this series of three preachings on a Saturday evening for three weeks. A special brother was invited along to preach. And that was a blessing to me because I came to faith during one of those meetings.

And so, you know, life was so different. And so I would say relatively normal. We were free of course to eat and socialize with with neighbors and whoever we came across, work people and such like. But of course in the 1960s, you know, everything changed overnight.

### **Jacky Hart**

And what did that mean to you when it changed? Again, I'm thinking of what my mother has told me in her memory of how it changed when the no eating, drinking and you mustn't see, you know, mixed with people outside. What did that feel like to [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=439s) at the time? You'd have been a young, youngish child.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah. Yes. Well, I would have been about 15\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=446s)

OK.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=446s)

When that ministry came in a separation. So I was still at school then, but I had to go through the experience of staying out of church, of school assemblies and that sort of thing. But then when I joined my late father in his business during the mid-60s and late 60s, I then eventually because of his ill [health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=477s) took over the business and I then had to tell clients, business clients and people that I worked for that I was no longer able to eat or drink with them. And that was a huge embarrassment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=496s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=497s)

I remember trying to tell them in brethren jargon, how I couldn't do this, why I couldn't do that. And quite frankly Jacky, I felt completely pathetic.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? And you must have felt, I'm trying to imagine how you felt because presumably you were allowed to eat and drink with them at one point and then you had to change it, isn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes. So it wasn't that you never, and I'm thinking of at school too, because when I went to school, I had to stay out of assembly, but I always had to do that. I didn't have to manage the, well, I can go in now, but now I can't go in. So that's a [slightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=535s) different dynamic to have to manage that change, isn't it?

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Yeah. No, it was very embarrassing and very awkward. Yeah. And how did the clients react or did they accept it?

### **Mark Storry**

Well, they couldn't make me out, of course, but they respected my view and went along with it, you know. But I mean, just to go into a little bit of detail, it was so embarrassing and awkward because sometimes I'd be in the middle of a business meeting and I'd hear the clanking of cups of coffee or tea in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=574s) adjoining room. And somebody would bring them in and I would say, I'm sorry, I don't drink coffee, which was actually not the truth.

### **Jacky Hart**

You just didn't add the 'with you' bit on the end. It's a difficult one, isn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah. Yeah. So moving on, in the late 60s, my father died and I continued to live with my widowed mother until I got married in 1969\. And then, of course, a year later, in 1970, the Aberdeen crisis happened, which was monumental. We had heard bits and pieces of J.T. Jr.'s antics prior to Aberdeen.

One in particular I remember shook me at the time. He'd been to Preston on his way up to Aberdeen and we'd heard that he'd, after the meeting he'd had a young sister sitting on his knee in the meeting room in front of all the brethren. So that just stuck in my mind at the time.

### **Jacky Hart**

And again, when you hear these things going around at that time, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=659s) was the general feeling amongst the brethren? Was it to people like the brethren in Nottingham, yourself and your wife, was it shock?

### **Mark Storry**

Well, I think it was shock, but we stifled it, of course. Yes. We were a meeting that was, I would say, fully supportive, certainly outwardly of Jim Taylor. We had a very [strong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=689s) leader in the person of Frank Fowler, whom you may remember the name. I don't know.

### **Jacky Hart**

No, I don't.

### **Mark Storry**

He was a very strong personality, very persuasive, very self-opinionated, I would say, and a gifted orator. So he was eventually, although he did waver at the time of the Aberdeen crisis, he did come out and fully support Jim Taylor. And so the vast majority, not all the brethren, but the vast majority of the brethren in Nottingham stayed.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=735s)

Yeah. That's interesting. Can I ask what that was to be like? Because I'm guessing you would have been in your, what, 20s?

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=742s)

Yeah, I would have been in my early 20s, yeah. 23, 24\. Yeah.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=756s)

I mean, that must have been quite a big thing to hear of and then to sort of almost have it repressed, I guess. It must have been quite confusing.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=767s)

Well, I suppose it was. I mean, it's a long time ago, Gilli, but I do remember some of it. But the thing that happened was that the truth of what happened at Aberdeen was hidden from the local brethren. You'll obviously be aware of the Bible depot that the brethren had, where all the ministry was distributed from. And there was a trustee of the depot at that time by the name of Robert Stott. And he had access to the names and addresses of all the brethren on their details.

And so he took it upon himself to write to all the brethren with the [details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=818s) of what took place at Aberdeen. And the instructions that were given to us in Nottingham were that if ever we got this letter, that we were not to read it and that we were to destroy it immediately because this was an attack from the enemy.

### **Jacky Hart**

I covered that story, but I never, it's nice to hear it. I heard that sort of, it happened, but it's nice to actually hear somebody that was there and was told that and experienced it because it's, yeah, it stops it being hearsay then, doesn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes. So the whole thing was explained away in terms of it being an ambush. And that was it. The fallout from the Aberdeen crisis was amazing. I mean, no doubt, Gilli, you will have heard about it in Birmingham where hundreds of the brethren left.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=870s)

Yeah, I think Birmingham went from 500 to 100 overnight.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=876s)

Yes, that's right. That's right. Yes. And I mean, I remember after 1970 going to going to Birmingham to to preach and the with just a handful of brethren there and it seemed very, very weird. But anyhow, that's another story I don't really want to go into that.

So just moving on, so that was the Aberdeen crisis and then of course just a few months later, as you know, Jim Taylor died. And there was much speculation as to who would take the reins. There were three horses in the race, if you like. There was Jim Taylor's son, James III. And there was also a black brother from, I think it was Trinidad, called Dr. Maynard.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=939s)

Yeah, he was Trinidad, I think. I remember my parents saying.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=944s)

Yes, and he was a rising star. And then there was Jim Symington. And it became quite clear early on that really James III was not really interested. He was a quiet, unassuming man. And I think Dr. Maynard would have loved the job, from what I understand. But anyhow, the person that inherited the mantle was Jim Symington.

And so what I call the Jim Symington's reign of terror began as from 1970 onwards.

### **Jacky Hart**

So thinking about how that happened to somebody, if you like, an ordinary person in the Brethren, obviously it was not a democratic vote or anything like that. So how did the channels at that time, and they had that change, there must have been a period of relative [instability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1009s) where there's no leader. What was that like in that interim before Jim Symington kind of emerged as the next man of God?

### **Mark Storry**

I can't recollect that period clearly or that detail clearly, but he fairly soon assumed the position. And I think Jim Taylor had indicated that Jim Symington ought to take the next big Levitical meeting, which was sort of like his blessing, if you like, on the future of the movement.

Yeah. And so, as I say, his reign, what I call of terror, began. And for me, and I think for many others, it was really a period of darkness and foreboding and such a hard, un-Christian way of dealing with people, dealing with issues, lack of forgiveness. It was really quite [ungodlike,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1080s) I felt. Didn't think it at the time, but looking back, of course, I can see how awful it was.

And as time progressed, those brothers, like our local brother Frank Fowler and many others that we had looked up to, who we would call ministering brothers, one by one, they were picked off by the Symington regime and either withdrawn from or demoted or whatever. And so the scene [looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1120s) very different in a comparatively short period of time. Right. So this line of ministry and so on happened in Nottingham and it resulted in the leading brethren in Nottingham being withdrawn from.

And to my shame, I had my part in that. One of the lovely things was that some time after we had left the Brethren and been withdrawn from, I made contact with Mr. and Mrs. Fowler and they very graciously forgave me. They didn't hold anything against me and although it was their intention to get back, they received us with real Christian kindness. So I don't forget [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1177s) and I was very grateful for it.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, I mean the Jim Symington era is the era I remember quite clearly growing up and my, you're absolutely right, at the time you didn't see it, but when you look back with your more mature years at the things that happened then, even in our meeting, I was from Luton meeting, it was quite horrific the things that happened. For no, for very, very trivial reasons, you know, families were split up, people were kicked out and sometimes you never really knew the reason why they were kicked out. That's what I found looking back.

### **Mark Storry**

Oh yes, really no, just yeah, quite absolutely. And the favorite peg to sort of hang different accusations on was the one that, oh, so-and-so is rival, he is rival, okay. You know, and we heard for [months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1241s) on end stories about different people being rival and being thrust out for that. So there was really very little forgiveness, if at all.

And I would really describe Jim Symington as being a bully. He bullied the brethren. Anybody that came up against him, he just exercised his authority in a very nasty way.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1272s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1274s)

And so under his leadership, there arose a guy in Bristol by the name of Henry McGahy. Oh, yes. I remember him. Now you remember him. Well, he was another bully. Yeah. But he had the full backing and blessing of Jim Symington. So, of course, nobody dared to question Henry McGahy at all. And Henry McGahy [grew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1305s) in amazing power and influence in the UK and beyond.

I mean, these men were held in such high esteem. They're almost like mini gods. Yeah. And so this hard line of treatment of the brethren, any slight misdemeanor, that anybody thinking slightly differently or questioning anything, saying I don't understand this or whatever, was dealt with by a very firm hand.

And so I'm talking now about 1970 through to 71, 72, 73, that time. And during that period, some of my wife's family left the brethren. I'll just run through briefly without mentioning names. But firstly, Helen, my wife, her sister and husband, they left of their own accord in, I think it was around about 1972, 73 time.

And then fairly shortly afterwards, her mother, my wife's mother and stepfather, her father died many, many years ago, mother remarried. So my mother-in-law and stepfather-in-law, they both were withdrawn from, falling foul of Henry McGahy. They didn't want to leave, where Helen's sister and husband previously did want to leave.

And then finally, in 1974, my wife's brother, youngest brother, and his wife left of their own volition as well. So that was three parts of my wife's family that left in a reasonably short period of time.

### **Jacky Hart**

So as a consequence, of course, I felt the spotlight was on me. Yeah, very much so. And just to pause there, what was, I mean, we all know the impact when somebody leaves your family, cut you off. That's been covered a lot of times in many, many podcasts. But the impact of that happening in three years must have been huge on your wife and yourself.

### **Mark Storry**

Absolutely. Yes. Yes. She was devastated. Absolutely devastated. And the thing is, Jacky, that very few of the brethren expressed real Christian feeling and sorrow over it. It was met with hardness. Yeah, you know, oh well, there's something wrong with your family. Oh, we always knew that they were this, that, and the other.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, and to [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1495s) just briefly if I may, to people who don't know the ethos of the brethren, what that would have meant for your wife, and correct me if I'm wrong Mark, is the minute her brother and his wife, her sister and her husband, and her parents left, she would have to cease all contact with them. In the 70s, it would have been all contact immediately, wouldn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Oh, absolutely. It would just be like, cut them off. And then alongside that, contained with the brethren telling her, well, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1525s) have to do that because they're wrong. Whatever they've done, they are the ones that are wrong.

### **Jacky Hart**

Which absolutely, it's just devastating, isn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, it is, absolutely. And it had a huge impact on her, which I'll come to later in my story. But we did visit my mother-in-law very briefly. We saw her in the garden of their home. They lived in Evesham in Worcestershire. And this, of course, was whilst they were out, and we'd only been out ourselves a very short time. But she wouldn't allow us into the garden even. She was absolutely petrified. My mother-in-law. So desperate, desperate to get back. It was all they knew.

### **Jacky Hart**

And how old would have her parents been at that time?

### **Mark Storry**

Oh, well, they would have been in their 60s.

### **Jacky Hart**

Okay, so it's been their life. It's their life.

### **Mark Storry**

Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely cruel.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah. So after all of this happened, Jacky, I felt the spotlight very much on me in terms of public comments made to me publicly in Bible readings and so [on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1607s) Snidey, cutting comments made about me personally. And also a comment passed privately to me from Henry McGahy concerning my wife. So I knew that my number was up at some time or other.

### **Jacky Hart**

And would this be because her family had left, you'd now carried that stigma?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, yes it was. Simple as that, simple as that. Nothing you'd done, nothing you'd, just that stigma. Yes, and one of the pet themes with Jim Symington and Henry McGahy, of course, was to debase and to downtread the sisters. So any female that had any vestige of [personality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1661s) or freedom of expression was well and truly stamped on. And I'm not for one moment suggesting that my wife was anything out of the ordinary. She wasn't. But for some unknown reason, they got it in for my mother-in-law and for her family. Wow. Yeah. And that became very apparent during the build-up to us being put [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1691s) of fellowship. Yeah.

So I'm not here to have an axe to grind. I'm just simply stating what happened.

### **Jacky Hart**

Absolutely. It's your story. It's what happened and probably something certainly that the brethren that will remember you probably don't know.

### **Mark Storry**

Well, I think there's a lot of truth in that. Yes, I do. Yes. Moving on from how things were hotting up during 1974, we then move into 1975\. And in January, and this of course [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1734s) just a few weeks after my wife's youngest brother and his wife had left. And so in January, one evening in January, it was a Monday evening actually, I remember it very clearly. We'd been to the Monday night prayer meeting as we always did and we got home and there was a knock on the door and two of the local heavies were there.

And [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1764s) we let them in of course and they come to take matters up with us. And they charged us with covering up regarding matters concerning Helen's brother and his wife, although they actually never made it clear as to what the real issue or sin was.

### **Jacky Hart**

What did they mean by that, [covering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1795s) up?

### **Mark Storry**

Well, they claimed that some sin had been involved with my brother-in-law, and that they reckoned that I knew something about this and that I had covered it up, which is absolutely untrue. But of course, as we were always told, the brethren are always right.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yep. [Yep.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1825s)

### **Mark Storry**

So I was, within a few days, I was presented with resignation forms to sign relinquishing my trusteeship of the local city meeting room. So again, that was a very firm indication that I was well and truly on the carpet. So they harangued us so badly, made us feel, I was going to say guilty, and yet we were not guilty. It was a weird feeling.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, I don't remember that feeling personally, but my father was subject to a similar thing. There was an accusation that he claimed he didn't do, but he ended up almost believing he must have done it because the brethren said so. And [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1880s) a very difficult thing to explain unless you've experienced it, isn't it? It is. You doubt yourself, you doubt your own mind, don't you?

### **Mark Storry**

You do. That was our, that was our experience. Yes. It was really mental torment of the highest level. Yeah. It was, and you almost began to believe what they were saying, and yet your conscience knew that it wasn't, it wasn't true. Yeah. And so that made [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1910s) really feel unclean and unworthy. And bearing in mind that, and I'm not justifying our situation, I'm just explaining it, that we didn't want to leave. No, we didn't want to hide anything.

So as a consequence, we confess to the, what I now look back as being the silliest, stupidest things that God had dealt with anyhow, you know. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1941s) so we didn't, so we decided we weren't officially shut up, but we decided to stay away from the meeting and try and get right and try and see this thing that the brethren saw about us and that we were not convicted about. More than an attempt to get right, and the more we tried, the less successful we were.

### **Jacky Hart**

I'm sorry to laugh, but I can see where you're coming from because again, it's that, it's something that's very hard to get across to somebody who hasn't been in that type of coercive situation. When you've been brought up to believe the [system,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=1983s) the assembly where you've been brought up is right, so if you fall foul of it, it's you that's wrong. Yeah, it's very hard to get out of that, isn't it?

### **Mark Storry**

Absolutely. And you're looking, well, it must be me that's wrong because it must be. And yeah, I empathize with where you were. That's true. That's true. So after a few weeks of just living in isolation, we were visited by these two [priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2013s) and they refused to see my wife. They told her that she was finished. Never explained what that was, but they just said you're finished.

And they met with me and gave me a right grilling. And I mean, I was in a right state, I can tell you. And I remember very clearly thinking, you know, am I saved eternally? Do I know the Lord?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2046s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2047s)

I knew I did, and yet there was something in me that made me think, well, did I? And it was a, it was an awful experience. And if anybody ever needed shepherd support, encouragement and strength, it was me at that time. But I never got it from these two that visited me. Yeah, yeah. And so they, that was how they spoke to me and they wouldn't see my wife at all. And so as a result of that, Helen was in a dreadful state.

She was so bad that I couldn't really leave her at home and go to work. And I ran my own business, which necessitated me traveling a lot on the roads to visit clients. And so what she did for a period of time was to come with me in the car and just sit in the car whilst I visited business clients because it was not safe for me to leave her at home on her own. Such was the trauma, and I cannot emphasize that enough. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2124s) was a dreadful, dreadful time.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of ex-members can empathise with that feeling. I mean, I know Ross and Gilli have both spoken on their podcast about feeling that low. Yes. Over just the pressure, I can imagine. She was lucky to have you, Mark.

### **Mark Storry**

Well yeah, I mean, you know, God has been good. I mean, I want to pay tribute to God's goodness and this is the main reason why I want to come on the podcast. But yes, she, we're very thankful for each other. So in desperation a few weeks afterwards, I rang up one of the priests whom I had known as a good friend over the years, just a [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2177s) years older than me. We'd been mates together and I appealed to him and I just said to him, please, would you come round? I don't, you know, we need help, both of us need help. And he refused and put the phone down. And that was the end of my contact with them.

### **Jacky Hart**

Wow. No reason given for that refusal? No, just nothing?

### **Mark Storry**

No, nothing. [Nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2207s) No, nothing. Wow. And then a week or so later, probably two or three weeks later, we received a letter delivered by hand. And it was a very brief letter. And it said, I haven't kept it. I wish I had actually, but I haven't got it. But one of the lines said that we had been withdrawn from [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2238s) we were no longer fit for Christian fellowship.

So there was no specific issue that we were withdrawn from. They didn't say you're guilty of this, you're unrepentant of that. It was, you are no longer fit for Christian fellowship. And that was the end of it. So you can imagine the, well, it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2268s) awful. It was awful. I mean, it's 50 years ago, but it's almost like as if it was last week.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Yeah, you don't forget the feelings, particularly when you do revisit them sometimes. Those feelings are still there, aren't they?

### **Mark Storry**

That's right. They'll stay with you forever. Yeah. And so being a good little brother at the time, I had all the green books on a shelf in the lounge and I went to look at them and I went to see what [Jim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2298s) Taylor said about people, what would happen to people who left the fellowship, what would happen to them. Right. And that made me feel worse. That made me feel worse.

### **Jacky Hart**

Can you remember what you found? I mean, we have tales of what Bruce Hales says about people that leave. But what did Jim Taylor say?

### **Mark Storry**

Well, I can't remember the words, but the inference was that you were leaving the place of salvation and protection and that really you were left to the devil. Yeah. So the same message, really, just in a different way. Oh, yes. Just condemnation over and over again. And of course, the PBCC are specialists in condemnation. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes, they are. Yeah. So our new life began.

We were out and we didn't know what to make of things. There we were, bereft of all my family and some of Helen's family, because she has a sister who is still in. Bereft of all the friends and way of life that we knew. And we kept ourselves to ourselves, hoping that maybe the brethren would take pity on us or whatever and come and see us. But nothing happened, nothing happened.

### **Jacky Hart**

It must have felt, that period must have felt like, I remember a similar, when I left a similar period myself, it's a complete wilderness. You have no anchor anywhere, do you?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, in that particular time, you've lost the anchor you were grown up with and you don't know where to go. That's right. I think that's a good way of describing it. It was a wilderness in every way, you know. Uh, yes, it was. And so after probably 18 months, two years, we decided to [move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2425s) house because where we lived was very close to the main meeting hall and we found it very uncomfortable with brethren including family members and my mother driving slowly by the house and peering in on their way to the meeting and that sort of thing.

And there was an occasion when Helen went into a local shop and who should come in behind her but [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2455s) mother.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2456s)

Oh my.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2456s)

So mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, one in fellowship, one out. And the shopkeeper knew of the connection, but my mother just ignored my wife. And we thought, hang on, we can't continue like this. No. So we moved right away to the other side of Nottingham, which was really the very best thing that we could have done. And so we moved there, and we were able to make a new life, put down new roots and so on. And then there came a big turning point in the late 70s.

My wife had an uncle and aunt who left the Brethren in 1970, and they broke away from all the splinter groups that happened as a result of those that wouldn't go with Jim Taylor. And they invited us to go to Keswick in the Lake District. And there was a Bible convention, like a week-long series of Bible [meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2528s) and so on with visiting speakers. And with much trepidation and fear and apprehension, we went.

And I won't go into all the detail of it, except to say that one of the guys speaking was a lovely Baptist minister from Bournemouth. And he referred to Psalm 40, where David says that the Lord lifted him out of the miry clay and set his feet firm on a rock. And I remember at that [occasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2567s) very vividly and it was just as if this man knew exactly where I was in my life, that there I was stuck in the miry clay. And you know, the Lord just spoke to me and showed me that there is another way. There are other Christians out there that we can fellowship with.

And that was at the beginning really of us thinking differently about Christian things.

### **Jacky Hart**

And to try and explain to, I mean, people who have left the brethren will understand the feelings you went through then. But to try and explain to people who haven't been in the brethren, to go into any other church or denomination is like, I don't know, but you're brought up to believe that you are in the only Christian denomination. There is only, you know, I remember being told, well, I remember being told as a child that if there were other Christians out in the world.

### **Mark Storry**

[Well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2628s) I never heard that, so the Lord must have moved on.

### **Jacky Hart**

He must have moved on, yes. But I remember quite clearly being told that. But the impact that has when you've been given that sort of message since birth, basically.

### **Mark Storry**

Oh, yes.

### **Jacky Hart**

So then to go to somewhere, like you say, you went to Keswick in fear and trepidation. Yes. I don't think it, to emphasise how strong that fear would be is quite difficult to get across because most people think, well, you know, you're free to go where you like.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2658s) to emphasise how that would have been breaking through so many barriers for you and your wife at the time, I imagine. Oh yes, I mean it was, it's the, it's the old judgmental condemnation thing. Yes, again, the brethren are expert at. Yeah. And I remember that very clearly, particularly the first time that we went to the church where we're in now, having a feeling, you know, that almost that God was so displeased with me for going through that door.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2686s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2687s)

Yeah. You know, we've been there 30, 40 years since, so it can't be, no, no lightning bolts have struck you down as you walk through the door. Yeah, yeah. But those feelings were very real. They're very real and very strong. Yes, as I'm sure many of your other conversationalists have felt the same.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2709s)

Yeah, it's almost like a betrayal of everything you've ever learned, isn't it?

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2711s)

Yes, it is. It is. And you know, Gilli, it took me some time to to come to this conviction, but it's almost as if we were worshipping another God. We thought we knew God, but it was almost as if we were worshipping another kind of God. We've been worshipping a hard, vindictive, ungracious God because we saw that in the leaders. We saw that attitude with the leaders. Yeah. Yeah.

So, there we were in our new home and we'd been married, how long? Quite a number of years. And we hadn't been able to have children, much as we longed to have them, particularly Helen longed to be a mother. And we spoke to, chatted to one or two Christian friends about the subject and somebody said to us, have we thought of adoption? Which of course was completely taboo amongst our brethren.

And we eventually decided to proceed with adopting. And we felt it was right to belong to a Christian fellowship somehow. And so we found a church that made us very welcome. And not many weeks later, having gone through three years of interviews and so on with the adoption agency, because of course as soon as they heard about our past life with the brethren, they wanted to know, well, what sort of couple were we?

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, would [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2832s) make good parents? Yeah, that's very interesting actually, because I've never really thought about that aspect. One thing I do know is in the brethren, particularly for a woman, having children is your pathway. That's it, being a mum and that's very important. And I always felt growing up that if a couple couldn't have children, there was a certain stigma attached. And I always felt very much for the wives of those couples because [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2862s) felt as if there wasn't a lot in their life.

But you're absolutely right, alternative ways of sharing motherly love or fatherly love weren't allowed, were they? You would not be allowed to adopt or give a home to a child that might need it and be able to share what you've got that way. And I've never really thought about why that was in the brethren.

### **Mark Storry**

No, well, I think there was the idea that maybe it was God's governmental dealing, some would think like that. Some would say it was his discipline, but it's his discipline whether you have children or not, you'll get the discipline. And also, God through Christ has adopted us, so it's a Christian principle, adopting. And what better to show Christian love and a Christian home to other children, yes, who might not have had it otherwise.

### **Jacky Hart**

That's right, have a stable home. I also wonder, just something you said there about, I know the adoption process, you know, it is a process to go through and it's extremely thorough in the UK, [whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2936s) there's a certain, if brethren couples apply to adopt, their lifestyle might make the businesses think, particularly the way the brethren live now, whoa, you know, because what you said about them probing into your background and where you and your wife...

### **Mark Storry**

Oh yes, it's something I hadn't thought of before. No, it's quite interesting. I mean, I think if adoption was allowed amongst the brethren, that they wouldn't stand a chance because the adoption people would not accept that way of [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2966s) and the intense indoctrination of children. But of course, that all had to be investigated and had to make sure that we were clear of it before they proceeded. So, as I say, we went to this church and then a matter of a few weeks of having gone there, we were contacted to say that our first son was available, shall I say, at [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=2996s) age of three weeks, which was a wonderful thing, a great time of happiness.

So we have one son, Oliver, and then we have, who's 42, and then we have Edward, who is 38\. And they've transformed our lives and brought us, we've had our ups and downs, of course we have, but they brought us great happiness and fulfilment. This was in the [roundabout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3027s) 1982 when we had Oliver. And then moving on to the mid-1990s, we'd actually moved house again for school reasons and for my work reasons. So we moved to the other side of Nottingham, where we're living now.

And during the mid-1990s, unfortunately, my wife had a mental breakdown, which was a very traumatic experience. And I put most of that down to the treatment that was meted out to her by the brethren. It left its mark. So she had to go through a period of treatment, etc., etc. And I'm glad to say that today she is much, much stronger and keeping well.

### **Jacky Hart**

But that's also quite interesting. I'm sure you're right. The trauma of what you went through mid-70s and the way she was treated. It's quite interesting that it really took that long to come out in the form of, you know, the health issues that she experienced.

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, yes, yes, that's true. That's true. Yes, yes. And so moving on into the 2000s, I think it was around 2001\. Our youngest son, I think, was away at a church camp. And our eldest son was home from university on his own at home because we'd gone away to France on the holiday. And once we were away on holiday, our son Oliver contacted us and said, hey dad, a couple of guys had turned up at the door. He said, I think I know who they are, because obviously we told him a little bit about the brethren and what they look like and [etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3167s)

He said, I think I know who they are. He said, they want to speak to you. So he said, I've told them that you're away on holiday and you'll be back at the end of the week. And so they said, well, they're going to come back and see you on such and such a date. We came home and one of the first things I did was to contact this particular person from the PBCC. And I just told them that I didn't want them to darken our doorway and that they had done us a great [favor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3197s) in excommunicating us.

And he said, oh, he said, we love you, we love you. So we should never have withdrawn from you. We've been going over things. This is 26 years later, 26 years later. We should never have withdrawn from you. There was no basis. And we love you. Will you come back?

### **Jacky Hart**

Like heck. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, do you?

### **Mark Storry**

No, well, it made me angry. Yes, very angry.

### **Jacky Hart**

I can imagine.

### **Mark Storry**

And I have to say that I'm not free of that anger to this day. No, yeah, yeah. Particularly when you think that they assume the position of knowing Christianity better than anybody else, [taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3252s) such high and mighty ground, being experts in the gospel, etc, etc. And yet when it comes to practicing it, they were far from the truth. And, you know, I just feel that God has been terribly, terribly misrepresented by all of this.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. So this presumably was what my husband is also ex-brethren. And it's what we call the period of glasnost when it's sort of early 2000s, when a lot of us got contacted and told the same. And I don't know quite what happened inside. Ross and Gilli were in then still. But it was this sort of seemed to be a movement to get a lot of us back, didn't it, Mark? It was like, you know, we love you. You should never have been thrown out. Oh, the door's open. Never mind the 26 [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3305s) and the trauma and everything else that...

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah, well, I gather that, I mean, we didn't know anything about this so-called review, of course. This contact that they made in 2001, I think it was, came out of the blue. It was a complete surprise. And then of course, the more we spoke to others, the more we realized, well, this is actually a global happening. I mean, I don't know whether Gilli has got anything to say about that period of time or not.

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3335s)

Yeah, I mean, it was essentially, it was interesting you saying about you speaking earlier about when Jim Symington came into power about people being stubbed down, because effectively it was the same thing again when it was John, this time it was John Hales, when he passed away around that time. Okay. Similar things would have happened. So you know, the people that, you know, the elders who would have been, you know, largely responsible [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3365s) everything, they, you know, they were in the same situation.

Some were excommunicated, some were shut up or confined as they call it. And then there was this massive movement of reviewing all these historical cases and suddenly realizing that actually there was no, you know, because normally they, when they excommunicate someone, they normally try and tie a scriptural basis to it. Right. I suddenly realized there actually was no basis for a lot of them. And there was a lot, there was a whole host of people. I remember my [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3395s) uncles being contacted. Obviously I was still in at that time.

And you know, even reviews of people who were still in, of their, you know, their cases being looked at and suddenly realising, actually, we didn't have any basis to do what we did. But yeah, I think the majority of people, I mean, there were some who did go back, but the majority of people I think probably took the same attitude as you, that actually, no, you've done too much damage, don't come crawling back now to try and justify it.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3430s)

Absolutely. I mean, we were not going to be separated from our family, from our children, our two boys. We were not going to go back into that prison and that place of torment and pressure. And it seems to me, Gilli, that those that did the dirty work in the local meetings were the ones that got the belting, as it were. But the big boys further up the ladder seemed to get away with it.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3457s)

Yeah, they got away with it. They got away with it scot-free. And I remember also, as Gilli said, you know, obviously some of the bigwigs were excommunicated or demoted. And I remember bigwigs dealt with the stuff in the time. They literally had to confess in the meetings to being wrong and wrongfully withdrawing from people. Especially, as Gilli says, to those that are actually still in and were shut up [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3487s) withdrawn from in the 80s, but subsequently came back. Yeah, it was a very, very weird time. It really was.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yes, yeah. I can remember one ex-member who's passed away now. He was quite elderly, also had a visit, similar to you, Mark. And when he described it, he said, it felt like they came round to wash their hands in my sink. In other words, and I thought that was quite a good analogy. So there was an apology for withdrawing from this person. And the same as you, we should never have done it. But he said, I felt no sincerity. It was like they were absolving themselves.

And he said that's what it felt like. And I thought the analogy [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3528s) they've come around to wash their hands in my sink was quite a good one. Yes, it wasn't really about you, it was about them getting...

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, yes. And I think that's what was said about them saying, oh, well, we've done it wrong, we've done it wrong. It was more about them getting it right than genuine concern for the people that they've kicked out.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3547s)

And also I remember that we had a couple live around the corner from us and one of their sons was contacted during the review and he went to visit them quite a lot, a fair few times. And basically the brethren were trying to get him back in and as soon as they realised that he wasn't going to go back, they just dropped him like a stone and wouldn't have anything more to do with him. They just stopped contact and that was that really. And I know the brother and sister that ran the corner from us, they were like, what's happening? Why can't he come and see us anymore?

### [**Gilli**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3589s)

There was no sincerity to it because it was all just orchestrated from above. They were just told to do it. Like Jacky was saying about, there's no feeling about those who they're actually dealing with because it wasn't a personal thing for them. It was just they were told to do it. I can remember people at the time being asked what they remembered about certain cases, and 90% of the time people hold their hands up and go, I don't know what happened. Obviously there wasn't anything really wrong, so we better say sorry.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3623s)

Yeah, I think really they were trying just to appease their own conscience, and that was really all they wanted to do.

### **Jacky Hart**

Did they actually come and visit you or did you refuse? I mean, you said, no, you said, don't darken my door.

### **Mark Storry**

No, I didn't want them near the place. Absolutely not. But we did get a letter from each of the two priests that came to see us all those years, 26 years earlier.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3653s)

Right.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3653s)

And the interesting thing was that the letters were virtually the same. They must have done their homework together because the jargon used was so similar. And, yeah, so that was that. And we've thankfully not had any contact with them since.

### **Jacky Hart**

Was it a letter effectively [apologising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3684s) for the way you were treated?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, they were saying that, yes, it shouldn't have happened and they wanted forgiveness and that was it.

### **Jacky Hart**

See again, that's where the washing their hands in your sink comes along, isn't it? It shouldn't have happened, they shouldn't have done it and they wanted your forgiveness. Never mind you and your wife and what you went through.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah, a very apt description, that. Yes. Yes, yes. So, as I said when I spoke to you, Jacky, I just want to really bear testimony to how good God has been. I don't want to labour that point unduly at all. And I'm aware that, you know, reading the comments on Facebook, listen to the podcasts, there is a massive amount of hurt and damage that's being done. It's incalculable, incredible.

But I've often thought, my wife and I sometimes thought, why us? Why should we have come out? It wasn't as if we had our eyes opened. We didn't. We were absolutely immersed in the brethren system. And I thought of what happened to Moses when he was put in the [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3773s) the bulrushes by the river Nile. And his, he was taken out of that situation and he was given the name Moses, which means drawn out of the water.

And I feel that's exactly what God did with us, that he drew us out for the reasons that he knows best. I don't know why, but I do know this, that he drew us out of that [situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3803s) that really was going on with evil. And we're so grateful to be out. And we've proved God's mercy and goodness in so many ways. And in terms of my, I can only speak about my personal faith, but I feel that that's stronger and stronger certainly. And my love for the Lord far deeper than it ever would have been had we remained in that system.

### **Jacky Hart**

Oh, I'm sure. Yes, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3837s) sure. And it's an interesting thing, isn't it? Because as you say, there's a lot of hurt. And I think when it comes to faith, when you leave the brethren, people go in many, many different directions. But I think it's really interesting you've said what you said, Mark, because there will be people in the brethren who maybe are not that happy or are thinking of leaving or it's just there's some sort of dissonance in their head. But the thing that holds them is that they believe they cannot have any faith outside [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3867s) the brethren because that's what they've been taught to believe.

Yeah. So and I think that's very much a myth that you want to get across. And I think your testament to that, not everybody chooses to follow that pathway and that is okay, that's okay too. But there are some people where the fear of losing their faith is so strong. And I guess what you want to get across is that doesn't have to happen.

### **Mark Storry**

Absolutely. That's true. Yes, it is. And I mean, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3897s) aware that there will be those inside who will listen, hopefully, to our discussion today and others that have left and so on. But the fear of coming out and losing your salvation, if you did have it, is extremely real. It's very real. And I want to try and annul those fears by saying that that need not be the case. Yeah. And that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3928s) truth and reality of the Christian faith can be much stronger and much more precious because you have to face things on your own. You're not depending on a system. Yeah. Yeah. So you work it out for yourself. Yeah. To your own judgments of what is right and wrong, depending on where your faith is at.

### **Jacky Hart**

If I can take you back to that period of time when you and your wife were withdrawn from, which was obviously exactly what you didn't want. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3958s) then you must go through this period of time with, oh, my goodness, what now? Sort of. And that period of isolation, the wilderness time. How long did that take you? I know we're talking sort of a few years back, but I still think that the emotions you would have experienced, albeit the circumstances might be different now, the emotions will be the same. So sort of what kind of time frame did that take you to kind of unravel what was going on before you could settle?

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, well, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=3988s) would say from our excommunication was in in 1975, in February 1975\. So for a period of probably six or seven years, our socializing really was limited to the few from my wife's family that came out. A few other people that we knew of who'd left. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4019s) that was really the only social circle we had for six or seven years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4026s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4028s)

One thing I didn't mention was that another, I would say, turning point in my life in terms of mixing with other people and mixing with other Christians was that in 1980, we both joined an organisation, a Christian organisation called Gideons International. Now, you may have heard of the Gideons. I don't know, but they're the people that put Bibles in hotels.

### **Jacky Hart**

Hotels, that's where I've heard of them.

### **Mark Storry**

Hospitals, et cetera, et cetera. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4059s) so by joining them, it meant that we saw a whole new way of life. And we mixed with other people, other Christians and so on, who all had a different approach to many things. And that enabled us to break down barriers. And it helped us to integrate more. But I would say that we didn't really fully get free in terms of mixing with all and sundry until probably the early 80s.

But then the fact that the Brethren came to apologise in 2001, however hollow that apology may have been, is not for me to judge really, except it did seem as if they were going through the motions at the time. But that gave us complete closure.

### **Jacky Hart**

That's interesting.

### **Mark Storry**

That we thought, yes, you know, why didn't they believe us 26 years [ago?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4123s) They didn't. But it gave us, in the right sense of the word, vindication.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. And that took 26 years before you felt the vindication of the way you were treated. And presumably in those early days too, I mean in the 70s, I remember them well, everything was banned, cinemas, you know, all the normal things that people in the world had. Did it take time before you [felt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4153s) comfortable going to restaurants, going to cinemas, doing anything like that?

### **Mark Storry**

We had, no, we went to, that was one of the things that we indulged in fairly soon after we came out, probably a year after we came out. Right. Oh yes. And then we discovered what holidays were. Yes. And then we had great fun trying to work the television. Yes, yes. So we enjoy all the normal things, Jacky. Yeah. Yes. Oh yes.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, yeah. It's very interesting because I think, you know, you obviously left a few years back as did I, and I think the circumstances of leaving have changed, the pressures are perhaps different. And Ross and Gilli might agree or not agree because they left far more recently, but the emotions are still the same and the fear and the trauma is still the same.

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, I mean, it does, it does live on, but in a very diminished form. Yes. But it is there. And it's the, what gets me at times is the injustice of it. It was so, it's not just about me, it's about many, many other people. Yeah, who, the injustice was dreadful.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can empathize for that one because [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4248s) you say, you can say, well, I've left, I had my life and I'm very, being very fortunate too. But there is still ongoing injustice still even today. And I think that that's why I do what I do here because there is still ongoing justice, injustice today to families and to people.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah. And I mean, and how they can continue with this idea that they are the church, the church.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4274s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4274s)

I mean, I remember that ministry coming out under Jim Taylor. There were one or two people who objected to that, but not many publicly. But I mean, how they can continue thinking like that in the light of all that's happened is beyond belief, really. Yeah. Yeah. And perhaps another point I want to touch on is something you mentioned earlier on. And you talked about the lead in Nottingham at the time of Aberdeen, I'm talking about, and the lead in Nottingham and how there were these [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4304s) going round about what had happened and what Mr. Jim was doing.

Yes. And yet you had a charismatic lead in Nottingham that managed to sway several hundred people that it was all okay. Yes. Are you able to sort of explain how that happened? And I can't imagine he sat there and said, it's all fine. It must have been much more subtle than that. And I'm quite curious as to how that came about.

### **Mark Storry**

Yeah, well, that's a good question. The Aberdeen split was, was it July time in [1970?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4335s) And just at that time, my wife and I have been invited to visit some three-day meetings in France. There was a New Zealand brother taking these meetings in a place called Le Chambon. And so with this division, I was wondering whether we should go or not. So I went round [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4365s) see the leading brother to pick his brains and get his permission or direction as to what I should do. And he was all at sea over Jim Taylor. He didn't know what to make of it at the time.

And I remember sitting in his study and phone calls came from various important brothers around the globe, you know, and they were talking about what Jim Taylor had done at Aberdeen. And I could see this local brother of ours, he really didn't know what to think at all. And, you know, I think if he had been minded to leave, most of the Nottingham meeting would have left with him. Right. But somehow, for some unknown reason, he switched sides. There was a very persuasive brother, well-known brother in Barnet, and he was very in with the local brother here. So, you know, Jim Taylor was the one to back and that's what we did in Nottingham and we went with the flow. No questions asked.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, I find that quite amazing. We were actually going to delve a little bit deeper into Aberdeen in a couple of weeks in another podcast, but I find that aspect of it quite amazing because it's part of the Brethren history. I was around them, but I have no recollection of it at all. Absolutely none. And it's part of the Brethren history that I think is so crucial. But I also think many members inside will be like me and not have any recollection of it or not really know what went on and how it was.

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, well, I'm very glad that you're doing what you intend doing, because the vast majority of those in there have no idea. All they hear is this mention of Aberdeen. I mentioned earlier that I have two nephews who came out of the Brethren, one very recently. I had a little contact with him prior to him coming out. On the quiet, we used to meet up occasionally. And he told me that they still whittle on about Aberdeen in the meetings.

So you think of all this younger generation who have no idea what [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4519s) means and what it was all about. And yet they have it rammed down their throats that they must accept it because a man of God is pure. It's a lot of rubbish and they don't even know what went on. So it's important the truth of it is conveyed. But of course, all we were told was that all the brethren in Scotland were against Jim Taylor. Well, it was absolutely rubbish. They were not. Many of them were open, ardent supporters of him. Yeah. But they just felt that they couldn't put man before scripture.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah. Interesting. Very interesting to have experienced that. And I think probably one of my final questions would be, what would you say, you say you've had a couple of nephews that have left, but what would you say to somebody now? It's a different world now to 1970, quite apart from, sorry, mid 70s. Sorry, quite apart from the brethren. What would you say now to somebody that's thinking of leaving?

### **Mark Storry**

Right. It's a million dollar question. You put me on the spot. Yes. I think you'd have to examine your loyalties.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4599s)

Yeah.

### [**Mark Storry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4601s)

Are you loyal to Christ or are you loyal to a system? Just as a small diversion, I don't know whether any of you have listened to a posting on the Faith Once Delivered to the Saints site, the PBCC. Well, it's well worth looking at. It's by Ron Fawkes of Australia, but I mean, he puts things in a very clear perspective as to how man has been promoted amongst that system.

And I think anybody who is thinking of leaving, they need to examine their motive as to who are they in fellowship for. Are they in fellowship for family, for friends, for finance? I was gonna say nowadays, for money, for a man? Or do they want to be true to the scriptures and true to the Lord? And depending on their circumstances, of course, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4672s) could be a tremendous price to pay to come out. But it's worth it. Yeah, you know, I mean, in some small measure, we've trodden that pathway. Yeah, but I can tell you, we're so thrilled to be out.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, yeah. And I think nowadays too, what you hear sometimes is, you know, the brethren's standard of living. And I mean, Gilli, you've touched on this a little bit when you've spoken about leaving because the life for the brethren now is very different [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4708s) when I was in materially. And that comes with its own pressures. There's almost a fear, you know, well, I mean, to put it bluntly, I couldn't possibly live in a flat or a terraced house because we only live in detached houses.

And that has been a way of life for brethren, some of them the age are now from birth. And that realization that actually all we need is a safe roof over our head, it doesn't actually matter what it's like, yes, is quite a revelation, [isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4738s) it?

### **Mark Storry**

It is. Well, I mean, it's incredible how things have changed and how things have been reversed. Because again, under the ministry of Jim Symington in the early 70s, any vestige of financial wealth, be it in terms of a home or a car, was roundly condemned.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yes, I remember the more ordinary and scruffy your home [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4768s) the more spiritual you were.

### **Mark Storry**

It was about, it was about being simple, wasn't it? And it was about, you know, there was none of this, I remember very clearly sort of late 70s, early 80s, there was none of this building businesses. It was about learn a trade, do a single job. Jesus was a tradesman, you be, it was very much that. And it's completely changed from that now.

### **Jacky Hart**

Completely changed.

### **Mark Storry**

Yes. So I mean, anybody who's inside listening to this, they want to see, right, what's that ministry [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4798s) the Lord or not? Clearly it wasn't. And if they come to that conclusion, then they need to think an awful lot about other things as well and trace things back to their source.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, yeah. Well Mark, thank you so much. It's really has been fascinating to hear the perspective from, you know, through the 50s, 60s and 70s, which as I say, is an era that a lot happened in the brethren but very, very easy to forget. But is also, I think, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBhDxyDRx8&t=4831s) important. And like you, I'd say to anybody that is inside listening to this, learn a bit about the brethren history and what happened because it's part of your history and it can just impact the way things have changed for you.

### **Mark Storry**

Yes, and they need to know, don't they? Yes, yeah.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848â€“1882) â€“ Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882â€“1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903â€“1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953â€“1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970â€“1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987â€“2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002â€“present)
