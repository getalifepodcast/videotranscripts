### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=9s)

Hello everyone. We are back with a part two with Terri. And we've brought another special guest with us, Hunter, and also Lane and Carman are here. I just read Lane's name at the bottom of the screen.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=31s)

Look out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=34s)

I love it. Anyhow, we are starting today off with a quote because it's very needed today. Oh, it's not there.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=55s)

Okay, so that one's not very inspirational. Sorry. Yeah, it showed for a bigger view, what is it showing?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=62s)

It's just showing a black video screen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=64s)

Okay, well it's not coming up so I will just read it. I really wanted to share it because people like to see things in black and white. Okay, this quote is by Jeff Brown. He is somebody that I absolutely love his quotes. So this came up on my feed this morning. "Trauma isn't someone else's story. It's your story too. It's everyone's story, whether they know it or not. We may have found a way to repress it, but that doesn't mean it's gone."

"It's still in there, running the individual and collective show. Only when we make the conscious choice to unpack it, we will be free. Our ancestors had no choice but to bury it, but because of the foundation they laid for us, we can choose otherwise. We can choose to heal ourselves and them together. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=119s) are the pioneers of healing humanity. What a beautiful opportunity. Let's get to work."

And that just like really set my tone for the day. It's something I very much believe in. My little pre-rant here before we get into everything is I guess I just want everyone to understand how hard it is for survivors to come on here and share their stories. How hard it is for [survivors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=149s) to sit in front of the police and have to give a statement. And so I guess my request from viewers and listeners is to be kind. Be kind to the survivors that come on here. If you haven't lived in their shoes, if you are not in their body, you have no right to lay judgment down on what they went through.

And so I think it's just [super,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=179s) super, super freaking important that we as humans...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=184s)

We lost you for a second, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=184s)

Yeah. Oh, you lost me?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=188s)

Yeah, just for a couple seconds. Just repeat what you were saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=190s)

Oh, it says my internet connection is unstable. I am unstable today. I very much am. Anyhow, I just believe that we as humanity and society need to learn how to support when someone decides to have the bravery and courage to come forward with a story, that we're not picking apart what they think is true and what they think is a lie. Because what someone has to endure from as little as two years old, whether it's 30 years old, it is not your choice to go up to somebody or to email someone [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=229s) judge what their bravery took them to.

So I just think that as we are moving forward, you need to cut out the judgments and offer kindness and compassion. I actually have somebody who also lives in Maple Creek, not to do with the PBCC, who couldn't come forward with her story. She tried and it was also bashed down. So I guess my thing is, leave the judgment to your own home. Leave your judgment to your [own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=259s) bedroom. And I don't give a shit what you think there. But if you're coming face to face with someone that is a survivor and has gotten the bravery to make a police report and to come forward, you need to offer them some kindness and compassion because that's what the world needs more of.

Anyhow, with that said, we are back here with Terri and joined with Hunter. Hunter is just new to the show. Hunter, do you want to just kind of give us a brief synopsis of what made me reach out to you, where you worked, and whatever information you want to share with us and with the viewers?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=302s)

Yeah, sure. So I worked at [Cutting Edge](https://cuttingedgeinc.ca/) probably when I started, either when I was basically just barely 18, maybe 17\. I think I had turned 18\. It was probably right after I graduated high school. So that would have been probably like either really late 2014 or early 2015\. I worked there for about two years before I went on to go to university and stuff like that. And I can confirm a lot of the stuff that Terri has said about working there. It was pretty, pretty bad on a lot of fronts.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=348s)

And did you find their treatment towards women very degrading like Terri did?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=356s)

I did, yeah. Well, and especially for me, especially when I was younger, I was very against doing anything particularly feminine. It was a struggle to get me to wear a dress anywhere. Skirts especially were not my favorite thing, but I needed a job, you know, and they kind of explained it to you in the interview process that you have to wear a skirt and stuff. And I just thought it was stupid. I just wore pants underneath my skirt, kind of like Terri did all the time.

It was very annoying. A lot of the time I would pressure them about it, be like, "Hey, I'm really uncomfortable wearing a skirt, I don't want to do it." But they were always just like, "Oh, well, you know, you need to look professional and stuff like that." Or there was a point where I had sprained an ankle and was recovering from that. I needed to be sitting down with my leg elevated all the time, and I talked them into letting me wear pants for the duration of that, just because it was extremely awkward to try to sit down and position myself in a way that was comfortable wearing a skirt and stuff like that.

But then it was like, "Oh, well you can wear pants, but they can't be like tight pants or it can't be anything that would be distracting to the men," kind of thing. And [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=434s) was literally like, I just graduated high school and I'm dealing with this shit again. Like, really? Oh yeah. So it was always very thinly veiled, but there was a lot of very sexist stuff that was enforced. They were always very careful about how they worded things and how they did things, but it was very, very thinly veiled.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=461s)

The United Nations just did a huge PR push, and I think it was, I can't remember the title of it, but it was basically, "It's not what she's wearing," right? And it was pictures of dresses and clothing, and it was like what she was wearing had nothing to do with what happened to her. And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing these people that are believing almost similar to the Amish way of [belief,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=492s) like that women can't wear pants, and then to force it on non-member employees is mind-blowing. Okay. Sorry, Hunter, go on.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=501s)

I was going to add that, so the professional thing, they always said it's about everybody looking professional. Which is so dumb, because we weren't customer-facing at all.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=511s)

No, and we're covered in paint. But yeah, there was a woman who showed up for work at one point and she had forgotten to wear a skirt. I've been there, I was there where I showed up and I'm like, "Oh, shit," and had to go home. Well, she had been dropped off and she didn't have her skirt on, so they made her tie a garbage bag around [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=541s) waist and she had to wear the garbage bag around her waist for the day.

Because that looks professional.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=548s)

So a garbage bag around her waist was considered professional?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=555s)

Well, a lot more professional than... oh my god, these people are the laughing stock of the world.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=557s)

It was, it was, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=565s)

Wow, I don't even know.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=570s)

How does that factor into religious thinking, right? Like Christianity. Like the Lord's up there and he can't look because he sees pants and the garbage bag is like, "Ah, good enough, good enough. I'll peek through my fingers."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=583s)

We're glad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=587s)

We're glad. Yeah. Okay, so Hunter, the reason why I contacted you is I'd come across a comment that you had made on the podcast and I right away obviously contacted Terri. I'm like, "Do you know who this is?" So you had made a comment on here that Garth commented on your skirt once and then you shut it down very fast. Can you tell me about that?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=615s)

Yeah, so I remember that pretty vividly because it was one of those moments where, you know when you get that something is just, you're on kind of shaky ground sort of thing? Like this is a moment of like, if I enable this to continue, it's going to be probably a reoccurring issue. And for reference, I'm gay, not interested in men at all. I was at that age, I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=645s) from about the age of 13, 14, somewhere in there. So it was just a moment of like, okay, on several fronts, this is a problem for me.

And at that age, I was pretty angry all of the time. I had a lot of frustrations going on, but all I really did was just, I have a very good resting bitch face and I just kind of [glared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=676s) him down. Like he's tall, he stands like, towers above me, but I just kind of stood there, looked him in the eyes, glared at him and he commented on my skirt and I just said like, "Cool," or something like that and blew him off and walked away. And he never talked to me again really, like outside of something that was work-related. He wouldn't come near me.

Him and Alan would both, they often worked, am I wrong in that they were over by like where the sanding area [is,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=706s) loading stuff onto the truck a lot of the time? 

**Terri Smith**

Yeah, they were there. They were there when you were there. 

**Hunter Briggs**

Yeah, they were working there. Yes, they used to work at the back. I know Alan was in the back sometimes too. But they were, my sanding station was the closest station to the open doorway where we would load things onto the truck. So they were there, they would stare at me, whatever.

Most of the time I was too [tired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=736s) and hot and stuff like that to really care. I was just like, I just sand my doors and go home. But yeah, I think they just probably got a sense that I was not gonna kind of play ball with them, really. Because I was polite when I had to interact with them, but otherwise I made it pretty clear that I didn't want to talk to them. And the mohawks, the mohawks probably definitely scared them. Yes, for [reference,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=766s) when I was at that age, I had at one point a rainbow-colored mohawk and then later on a mohawk probably this high off my head that was lime green.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=776s)

Awesome. They probably, that probably freaks them out.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=779s)

Probably, yeah, and probably a contributing factor.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=782s)

Love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=783s)

Are you okay, Hunter, if I read your comment that you posted?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=783s)

Yeah, sure. I mean, there's probably typos, it was on my phone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=783s)

Oh, that's okay. I just cover so much in this and you articulate it very well, and then we can just dive in a little bit more.

"So there's this, I am experiencing the amount of unfortunate flashbacks to work at Cutting Edge between the age of around 17-19. I remember Terri talking about the stalking when I was there. I remember what the spray booth looked like, and let me tell you, if some kind of inspector ever came through there, it would have been shut [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=814s) so fast. It was just atrocious.

I dealt with nothing like what Terri went through in terms of dealing with Alan and Garth. Garth commented on my skirt once and I shut that shit down pretty fast. They were admittedly creepy as hell and they stared at me and the other women in the shop all the time. The amount of shit I knocked over around the shop from my long skirt getting caught on shit, being non-stop on the verge of being ill from the heat in the shop, even though my workstation was near the doors we opened in the summers.

I remember them catcalling the water cooler girl who was I think [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=844s) two years younger than me and being so pissed. But what do you do when there's like one other woman in the shop and all the people you work directly with are in on the behavior? The endless frustration with being demanded you do more, more, more, and the endless frustration with trying to follow guidelines for QC and having the literally useless supervisor bring back your rejects that are clearly too poor to send out. So I'd sand them, they'd hit QC, and QC would bring them back, and then the supervisor would override him too.

I remember when I sprained both my ankles outside [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=874s) work for the second time playing sports and they threw out the only stool in the shop so I couldn't sit down anymore. I had not asked for a doctor to put me on time off for them to heal because I assumed I would be able to sit down like the previous time. I'd had this sprain. My ankles are now chronically in pain from never healing properly because I had to be on my feet non-stop eight hours a day.

Again, I can't play sports or jog, run because of the pain from the impact. I had breakdowns in the bathroom when they started to demand more and more in terms of quantity from the sanding department, even when we were sending upwards of like 300 doors [per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=904s) person a day, and wanted us doing like 500 per instead of just hiring one or two more people. I remember threats of them docking pay that I heard about from my Filipino co-workers but never had directly discussed with me.

They also screwed my dumb, barely adult ass out of unemployment benefits by having me sign off that I was quitting when in reality they were basically firing me. I was so desperate to get out of there it didn't even matter."

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=929s)

You cut out again quickly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=930s)

Oh, did I? What's wrong with my internet today? Okay, I'll go back. 

"They also screwed my dumb, barely adult ass out of unemployment benefits by having me sign off that I was quitting when in reality they were basically firing me. I was so desperate to get out of there it didn't even matter. And it's a piss-off because I genuinely enjoyed the work itself and was quite content for the first handful of months I worked there. It was all the other shit going on.

I literally still have stress dreams where I'm trapped in the shop and this is, this just shocks me. I also never did a WHMIS course the entire two or so years I worked there."

### **Terri Smith**

I did one. One.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=968s)

 Yeah, they kept saying like they were like, "Oh, it's something we'll get around to," and whatever, whatever, and it just never happened. Never happened. 

**Terri Smith**

No, wow. And I mean, Hunter and I used to take turns breaking down in the bathroom. Yep, pretty much. Yeah. I just feel like every time there was women in the shop, that was like a thing I noticed after the first like two, maybe three months of working there. Usually, it was like a revolving door into the gender-neutral bathroom because there was no women's bathroom. There was just a single, one-room kind of bathroom for the women to use.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1015s)

Tell me about the catcalling that went on. I mean, Terri's talked about the air horn and all that kind of stuff, but Hunter, give us your experience with the catcalling that happened.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1025s)

Well, like, okay, so the doors that I mentioned by where my sanding station was, when they would be bringing in the water jugs to replace the one that's already on the water cooler and stuff like that, that's kind of where they would come in through. So my station is literally right there. And the sanding department is kind of right there and takes up that whole area of the shop. And then there's stairs to go up to the break room. And then you can go into the office as well from just kind of right along where you come in that big open truck door.

So they would come in through there to deliver the water. And pretty much as soon as someone noticed that she entered the building, it would be like, I only heard the air horn specifically go off once, maybe twice in the time that I was there. I think they maybe had gotten a talking to at one point about it or something. And but then when it wasn't the air horn, then it was like cheering, like aggressively loud catcalling, cheering, hooting, hollering.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1090s)

Every time the air horn was the signal and then all of the guys all the way back at the shop would start from the back and all the way to the front and they would hoot and holler.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1098s)

So literally like elementary school.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1101s)

Worse. This is not even high school. Worse. It was worse. Who does that? Oh. Absolutely like… Oh yeah. It drove me nuts because I know who she is. She was 15\. Yeah. She's my brother's age. So if I had been 18 working at the time, 17 depending, she would have been 15 or 16 years old. Yeah, because you were doing classes there. Yeah, well, and I had gone back to school is what that was. Like I had gone back to retake some classes so that I could get into university hopefully at some point.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1140s)

So if a male FedEx driver came in, did any of that noise happen?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1146s)

No, and eventually I think they swapped over to having her not bring it in. Every once in a while, like someone else would bring it in for her.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1154s)

So they can't handle when a woman walks into the shop?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1159s)

Apparently not. No. It's a lot. It's a lot for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1162s)

And then you know what, here's where I get to the point, and you know, like this is where they need to learn about how to treat a woman, right? This is their the part in their education that is lacking so bad is they do not have any education on how it is to cohabitate properly with a female. They don't do their sex education in school, so of course all this pent-up energy comes up and then this is what you get. You get this kind of abuse.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1192s)

Like just the pants thing alone should be like, oh my goodness, are you kidding me? Like what day and age are we in, right? Their behavior towards women is just so disgusting and they can't hide from it. We're gonna keep fucking pulling this shit out.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1207s)

Oh, slapping on the ass like...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1211s)

Actually physically touching?

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1212s)

Oh yeah, I got slapped on the ass every day I worked there. 

**Hunter Briggs**

Yeah, I think they kind of knew better than to try that with me. 

**Terri** 

He would either slap me with his hand or he'd slap me with one of those things from like, almost like a Christmas wrapping tube. You know, yeah, when I went by. Or I got to the point where I couldn't walk past him. And you had to walk past him to go to the bathroom, you had to walk past him to go to the water cooler, you had to walk past him to go to the office, you had to walk past him to go anywhere.

And I wouldn't walk past him. And I finally went into Tim and I was bawling and I said, "You need to handle this because [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1266s) I can't do this anymore. Like I am so sick and tired of working here." Well, and we had this joke, I can't remember if Hunter was there, where every day I would, as soon as something would go wrong, I'd say like, "Well, I should have known this day was going for shit. This could all be solved if you started stocking liquor in the first aid cabinet."

And I'd always look at Tim and I'd say, "Black Label Scotch whiskey, isn't that your drink?" And he'd say, "Yeah, you're right." He said it's probably because I was like, and that we would joke about it. I'd say, every single day I would say, "You'd have to be drunk to want to work here." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1318s) I would every day, I would say, "You know, you should switch that first aid station to liquor. Everything here would probably go a lot smoother," because you couldn't get through a day. It was like all day degrading.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1337s)

Hunter, what do you think needs to happen at that business in order to become a viable business? Because at this point, it shouldn't be up and running.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1351s)

No, it shouldn't be. There's a lot to unpack there. Like, I wouldn't even know where to start. Like, there's just so much wrong with the whole culture, I guess is the word I'm looking for. Like the whole culture of everybody who's around the place, everything like that. Like, it's all, I wouldn't even know how you go about fixing something like that.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1380s)

No. I think charging them with a crime like sexual assault and sexual harassment would be a good start.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1386s)

Well, yeah. And workplace safety violations. I mean, for your, I mean, the thing is, is our ankles, we can't live without our ankles. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I mean, for you to still be suffering from that. That's horrible. 

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1399s)

Well, and it was just super frustrating because like, I had, I think the month before or a month or two before that, I had sprained my ankles playing roller derby, which is a thing that I was doing back then. And so I'd gone to the doctor, I had had like a week off to let it heal or whatever because I was like, I'm pretty much on my feet, you know, for the whole day that I'm there on cement floors with like one of the little rubber mats to stand on and it's super uncomfortable.

So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1429s) had my, so bad, yeah. So I had my week off for my ankles to heal and it was fine, except I was still having some issues with them. They hadn't fully healed. So they moved me from sanding the actual cabinet doors to the back sanding panels, the panels that go into the actual center of the door. And back there, the workstation was a little bit shorter. They had like a stool that I could sit on. So, and then that's also how I talked them into letting me wear pants for several months without getting in trouble.

That was shorter because of me. That's my station. Yeah, I kind of wondered if that was the case. Yeah, we had to. Yeah, there was a whole process to like cut it short. But yeah, so I just sat back there. I sanded things like on the stool because of the way that the workstation was set up, I could kind of elevate my ankle into one of the drawers almost and just sit like that and sand panels all day. And like, I kept up fine. Like I usually ran out of panels and stuff. It's not like it was slowing that part process down or anything like that.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1502s) then I kind of healed up again, but I was still back there sanding panels and I was kind of just like alternating between standing and sitting. And then I had gone to an away game somewhere and I sprained both my ankles in the same weekend, once playing a game, and then I fell down my stairs when I got home trying to lug my equipment bag down my stairs. I remember that. But I was like, oh, like I went to the doctor and he was like, "Yep, both your ankles are sprained again. What the hell, man? Like, what are you doing?"

And I was like, "It's fine. Like, don't put me [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1532s) work. I've already got like a situation at work where I can sit down, whatever." I came in, I think I had one day where the stool was still back there. They had thrown out the stool at some point while I was away over the weekend. Yeah. So I had no way to sit and I hadn't asked for a doctor to give me time off. I couldn't afford to have time off because I was trying to save up stuff for university and university application fees and stuff like that.

So like, yeah, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1562s) was pretty crappy. And like, to this day, my ankles are really weak. Like I've sprained them a couple more times since then and they hurt constantly. Winter is brutal because it's just constant chronic pain from the cold and stuff like that. And yeah, I, as a kid, I was like, "I want the money more than I want the time off for my ankles to heal." Because I didn't think it would be that bad because it's just a sprain. But I really should have gone back to a doctor and gotten another two weeks off work or something just to let them heal.

And you know, you have a very similar story theme that happens with a lot of people that we find that work for the PBCC, where it's like, "Push, push, push, do more, do more, do more," without hiring more people. So when you quote that in there, it's very familiar talk when you talk to people who are working for them.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1618s)

The teachers as well have said that. Teachers that have worked for OneSchool Global. And I think Bruce Hales is really the one who pushed that in when he came into power. He was all about business. And then that's when I started noticing that people were working insane hours. Like they would get up at four o'clock in the morning, get to work for 5 a.m., finish at six, stuff food in their mouth and race to church at the end of the night. And then they started working Saturdays as well and pushing their [employees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1648s) to work insane hours. And I think it all started because of Bruce Hales's big money push.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1654s)

Oh yeah, it was. Absolutely. Because we saw that. We started working more hours. They wanted me at one point, Arden sat there yelling at me in the spray booth because they wanted me to quadruple my production. Quadruple.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1676s)

That's insane. And meanwhile, what did we learn over COVID, right? We learned that we all need to take a damn break. We need to slow down a little bit, not work insanity hours and kill ourselves. What, to have more material items? Cool.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1692s)

They had me there at five o'clock some mornings and I was in there at midnight some nights still.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1699s)

Yeah, actually I talked to Chuck Glennie and he confirmed that. We had a little conversation the other day.

**Terri Smith**

 Yeah, he used to come in there and check on me because he'd see my car parked there all night and he'd be like, "What if she's in there hurt? Like she can't possibly still be working." And he would come in there and I'd be spraying.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1716s)

Holy cow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1719s)

Terri, tell us the story about when Tim and Lisa went to Australia and then came back.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1725s)

It wasn't Tim and Lisa, it was Arden and Tim, I believe, went. And Lisa was home and the kids were kind of running things a little bit. And Lisa was getting, I think she was doing Zoom calls or video chats with him every night. And she came in, she would come in and talk to me every morning and ask me how I was doing. And we talked about the kids and stuff. And [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1755s) pulled out her phone and she was gushing, like gushing about the lavish eight-course meals and the opulence.

Like how beautiful the china was and how expensive the furniture was and how, like she was just gaga over it. Like she was just… and when they came back, that's when they went, "Oh my God," like threatening to deduct, if we made a mistake on the doors, they were gonna deduct it from our, the cost of the door from our paychecks.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1799s)

Oh my God.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1800s)

Do you know if they ever did that? Oh no, they didn't because one other employee and I shut that down right in the middle. I went up against Barry. Barry and I got into words over that and started yelling. And the other one was in, because we used to break up into little sections, little team meetings amongst the team, and Barry was my supervisor. And yeah, so the other employee was in [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1830s) group and I heard the yelling from that group too. And the other employee came back after lunch with, he had printed out the whole section from the labor code where it says you can't do that. And Barry had been, he's like, "Oh, there's ways around that." Oh yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1856s)

And I was like, yeah, illegal ones. Exactly. It doesn't matter how you cut it, it's still illegal.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1867s)

So, do you know who else did that? You know, deduct from your pay if you fuck up or go against a wall and get shot? Stalin. Stalin did that, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1879s)

This is kind of an off-the-wall question, but Hunter, how do you think the community of Maple Creek views PBCC and Cutting Edge? Like what is their reputation?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1895s)

So I can't speak for Cutting Edge specifically, and I can only speak for the people that I grew up around and the family that I grew up with. But like, I don't know. Generally, most people think they're kind of weird, I think. At least in my family circle and everything around, like we don't really know much about them, but it's always kind of just like, they're odd. I think there was a point in time where some of the Plymouth Brethren kids were going to the schools in Maple Creek, am I wrong on that?

**Terri Smith** 

Yeah, they were. [Okay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1925s) because I was, yeah, they went up to grade five, I think, at one point. 

**Hunter Briggs**

Yeah, that tracks because I'm fairly sure that there were a few PBCC kids in my class up until about that age. And it was always like, I mean, the two boys that were in my class, we didn't like because they were just kind of rude, I guess is what we'll go with. But there was the one girl that was in my class as well who, she was just quiet, she was polite, she was nice. We didn't [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=1955s) a problem, she never gave us a reason to have any problem with her.

But the other two would, like one of them tried to push my brother off his bike and we were going home, walking home one day, or one of my friends, I don't remember the exact details. We were walking home, everybody, me and my friend were biking, and tried to kick one of us off our bikes. I remember that. I don't think that's necessarily a reflection of the entire community. I think that one particular guy was just kind of a shithead.

But yeah, like, even growing up and living in Maple Creek my whole life, you just don't know a whole lot about them. Like, they're there. We used to sprint through, because the church is right across the street from the elementary school, and it was kind of on my route home when I was in elementary school, and we would walk home and whatever. And I'd be carrying this big, like I used to play the euphonium when I was in grade school, so with this big tuba-like case that I'm, you know, lugging around as like a tiny [12-year-old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2019s) child trying to walk home with it. So we'd cut through the parking lot to get home a little bit faster and it'd always be like, "Okay, we have to sprint before someone comes out and yells at us or gets us or something like that." It was like a thing.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2031s)

Because it looks like a compound. They all look...

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2033s)

Well, and this was before the fence. The fence didn't used to be there. Yeah, the fence wasn't there before. The kids used to toboggan down the, when they clear the parking lot, yeah, because there would be huge snow pile in there.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2053s)

So what would your parents say if you came home and said, "I'm gonna go get a job back at Cutting Edge"?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2057s)

I think there would be a lot more questions before any concerns about why I'm going back to Cutting Edge. There would be a lot more questions about like, why I'm back home period. But I don't think that they would comment on it too much honestly. Like, most of the time it's just kind of, "Do what you want to do," I guess.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2088s)

Did you go back and work there though?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2090s)

No, never. Yeah, literally never. It's like, honestly, working there really affected how I look at work as a whole because it was so stressful and I was so young when I did it. Like, it's taken a long time for me to even, like, it's very frustrating because back then I was so excited to work. I really liked working there. I liked the job. I liked, like, it was a very physical job on some fronts because it's exhausting to be standing there sanding things [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2120s) day. But it was also like a very details-oriented job that had almost like a little bit of art to it. And so I really enjoyed that.

But then like just the constant demands for absolutely more than what we could handle with the staff we had and the tools and the setup that we had and stuff like that. Like, yeah, that constant pushing and then like almost like gaslighting me about it when I would complain about it to Tim.

 Oh my God, the gaslighting. Yeah, like that was a big thing. It would be like, "You guys keep coming down on the sanding department about XYZ thing." And at one point, I was the only person in the sanding department who had been there for an extended period of time other than I think like one other guy.

And I can't remember what happened if he was getting bounced around to other departments as well or what, but at one point they had me trying to train new staff that were coming in. And I'm like 18 and a girl, and most of them are not listening to me [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2180s) I'm trying to explain how you do things and stuff like that because they told them not to. Yeah, well, and I would complain to Tim about it and Tim would just be like, "Oh, well, you know, whatever." And then, or I would complain about like, "Okay, you guys are coming down on us about the quantity that we're doing, you're coming down on us about quality."

And we're trying to send back these doors that are like terrible quality. They've got knots and like discoloration all over them, but every time I try to do that, it goes to Barry and Barry just doesn't send it back. Yeah, he just [overrides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2210s) it and is like, "No, it's good enough, it's fine." And then it'll get to our quality control guy, and our quality control guy, like 50/50 chance he would just let something slide or bring it back to me and give me shit for it. And I'd talk to Barry, "Not my problem, I tried."

Yeah, but it's like, it was an incredibly stressful environment to be working in, especially in the summers when it was so hot. I remember we got bees or wasps or something all over the shop the one time because we had to have the big [door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2240s) open, otherwise you would just boil in there and even that barely helped. Yeah, the wasps are really bad and the bees, because the bees come for the sawdust. So yeah, so we would have just swarms of like bees in the shop and all over the sanding stations because we're right there and there's lots of like little kind of nooks and there's UV lights that they were really attracted to because the glue that we're scraping off the cabinet doors has a UV formula in it [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2271s) we could see it when we're scraping it off.

So there are bees all over the place. It was, it was stressful. Me walking around with my EpiPen going, "Blue to the sky, orange to the thigh." Yeah, but it was just, it was a really stressful environment, especially as one of my first, like not my very first job that I ever did. It was like the second place I'd worked. I'd worked out at the cattle sale ring in town [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2302s) off and on, but different. Well, honestly, the sale ring wasn't, not in the area that I was in. I just chased cows all day and I was happy with that. Cows don't catcall.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2317s)

Exactly. One thing I was wondering is when you guys worked there, did you ever have times where all the brethren members would disappear for like a fellowship meeting or something like that? Like these, that's what they called them in the church, where you guys were expected to keep working but they were like gone to a church gathering.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2337s)

Probably. They would go to weddings, they would go to funerals, they would go to, they would have like meetings when they had their big meetings here and we would have to stay working. They would leave at like two, they always leave at like two or three, and we would have to stay working and we would have to like make our quota even without them there. So like half the shop is missing and we were expected [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2368s) maintain the same level of production.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2370s)

Wow, yeah, ridiculous. So what, because what I'm wondering is whether brethren members pay their own employees while they're off doing churchy shit, right? And because like they're getting way more time off, because I know other events they have, one a month, they were probably going to events all the time, right? And then their non-member employees are expected to keep working, right?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2395s)

Yeah, and I didn't even notice really when they left because my department was predominantly non-brethren and they wouldn't tell us. Yeah, you would just, I would go, I would like wander to go get new sandpaper for my sander or something and just realize that like half the people in the...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2419s)

So Hunter, did you ever, I know they tell you you can't compare your pay, but did you ever discuss pay? Did you find out if you were getting paid the same as all the men that were in the shop?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2428s)

Probably not, because I was getting the absolute bare minimum for Saskatchewan at that time, which I think was about $10.50 an hour. Wow, maybe, maybe $11, I'm not sure. It just kind of depends, but it was like maybe 20 cents above minimum wage or something like that.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2428s)

Yeah, and I think I was at $13.75. And you've been there for like way longer. Oh god, yeah. Yeah, there was never any raise or anything like that either. I wrote the training manual for them for sanders. I wrote the employee ad book.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2464s)

One of the things that we had a lot of questions about after we did Terri's other podcast was about the lacquer, those big five-gallon buckets and the stain buckets and all of those. Did you guys, were they put in a secure area where children couldn't get them?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2485s)

No, I think those are just sitting out in the shop, weren't they? Like pretty much right behind QC if I'm remembering correctly.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2493s)

That's against so many WHMIS regulations.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2495s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2500s)

Yeah, and then when they threw the buckets outside, were they ensuring there was no stain or varnish or anything left in there that could like drain into the environment?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2513s)

Like drip pans, was there drip pans everywhere for the bucket?

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2517s)

No, absolutely not. Not one, right?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2521s)

Bastards. Dirty bastards.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2522s)

Oily rags. That does remind me of like one other big thing that was a chronic issue for me was we would have these, I don't know if they were like vinyl panels, but those really big heavy ones that they would be almost like a plasticky edging along them. And so if, yeah, the veneer, yeah. So I would have to scrape the glue and like the panel stuff off of that with a knife, but sometimes you've got a lot of glue that [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2552s) coming off. So they would give you, NextGen doors, they would give you a paint thinner to take that off.

I was using it without gloves, bare-handed, no mask. I would get so high basically off of inhaling that. The one day it made me so sick, and then after I had finished with the order of doors that I had gone through with, I just went back to doing my regular doors. And while I was scraping glue off of a door, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2583s) was so out of it. And so like my hands were shaking. I actually stabbed myself in the hand, like in the wrist with one of the chisels. And I've still got a tiny little scar there. But at that point, I just said, "I'm going home." Like, I walked into Tim's office and was like, "Hey, I'm messed up. I'm leaving." Was basically how it went. And I just left. Like, I don't think we really even had a conversation about it. I was like, "I've inhaled too much paint thinner."

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2583s)

Hours, yeah, hours and hours of paint thinner. It was you, Lisa did it, when Lisa, Monica, Melanie. [Melanie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2623s) was doing it for a while. We were doing it. We would literally like, there were days when we would take turns vomiting outside the door.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2632s)

Oh my god. So they literally don't give a shit about their employees, except for the brethren ones. Their employees' safety and health, absolutely zero regard. And zero regard for the environment. They claim to be a mainstream Christian church, they're so far from it. Not caring about the environment and not caring about human health. And I know why they don't care about the environment, because I [remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2662s) the teaching. So the teaching was that they thought if the environment goes to hell, that's just proving that Revelations is real. So they actually don't give a shit about the environment. I'm serious because they're like, "The environment is going to hell, but the world's going to hell anyway. And Jesus is coming to save just us. Yay. So we don't care." And that's a terrible way to live.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2687s)

Yeah. It is.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2689s)

It's horrible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2691s)

Terri, I want to switch lanes here with something that you told me after you did your podcast and I was like, wow, I was just shocked. It had to do with a message that was written on a conveyor belt after Janelle left the church. Yeah. Tell the viewers what happened.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2715s)

So when Janelle left the church, she came in to work. I'm assuming she had just been shut out, I don't know what led up to there, but she was coming to work anyways. So she showed up, she showed up in her work clothes, in her skirt and her work shirt, and they told her she couldn't come in. And [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2745s) basically was yelling at them. I love teen Janelle. And she basically told them that it was illegal, that they couldn't fire her because of her religious views.

And they got into a big argument. And I think there was something to do with her car because she had a like a sports car there and she had bought that with her own money, separate. And I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2776s) they were trying to tell her she couldn't take her car, but I can't confirm that for sure. It's been a lot, it was a long time ago. We're talking like 2004-ish, I think. But then I remember her just screaming and swearing at them the whole time. And she just walked and she got into her car and she drove off.

That afternoon, or maybe the next day when we came back in, "Janelle is a slut" was written all over the, was written on the wide belt. And that stayed there until they got rid of that machine.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2813s)

It stays there?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2815s)

Seriously? Like this is what I'm just telling you, like when you told me this, my mind was blown that Tim Bond...

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2825s)

I ran that machine when she left and I looked at that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2827s)

Tim Bond, the leader of Maple Creek PBCC, so he takes the lead there, is what I've been told, allowed that to stay on a belt for everybody that's coming in and out of that. How fucking professional is that?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2843s)

That's disgusting. Tim Bond, you're disgusting. You disgust me. That is awful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2852s)

Like my heart broke for Janelle when you said that to me because I mean, she is, she's such a sweet, sweet girl. Yeah, she's feisty.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2862s)

She needs to be feisty. She was feisty. I mean, oh, she, well, I remember when she came into work and she'd cut her hair and put highlights in and she had pierced her ears. And that was not that long, I think that was maybe only a week or so probably before all this happened. Maybe, I'm trying to think back, but it wouldn't have been that long. And she was just so feisty and she was like, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2892s) were telling her to take them out. "I'm not taking them out, not taking them out."

Yeah, so she was like feisty, but good for her. Nobody ran that shop like Janelle. I mean, honestly speaking, like she was probably their number one all-time production person. Like she did it all in that shop before she left. And yeah, but she was, but I mean, I stayed close with her. I stayed friends with her beyond that.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2929s)

[When she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2929s) was there, her dad passed away, I don't know what year that was. How was that in relation to when they got rid of her?

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2938s)

It was very shortly after, because I remember, yeah, it was not that long after because I remember her stopping at her dad's grave before she left town. Like, I held her, I held her when her dad died. Like she, I remember, I remember the day he died and she came in and she told me, I, it broke her heart. Yeah. And [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2969s) worked through that because they made her work through that.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2971s)

They didn't give her any time off for grieving?

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2975s)

Not that I remember, no.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2978s)

See, this is what I want the listeners to know, is how they treat people, right? It's absolutely, it's absolutely insane that they think that they can treat people this way and call themselves a mainstream Christian church.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=2995s)

And this was a young lady that, Janelle Drever, she was the youngest of eight children. 11 or 12, it could be, I'm just shooting in the dark, I don't actually remember, but she was the baby of the family. She was so attached to her, you know, to her dad. She was a daddy's girl, always was.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3020s)

Yeah. We need to get this to the authorities, that these people, because we know that this has happened multiple times, right? A brethren member decides to leave or gets kicked out, right? And then they get fired from their job, which is illegal because that's firing someone based on religious grounds. And it happened to me. My dad pushed me out, right? I had to work from home and then all of a sudden my job was just gone, right? And that was because I was withdrawn from, as they call it. So this has [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3051s) multiple times. We need to get the authorities involved.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3054s)

Yeah, I agree. I agree that the authorities need, especially with Cutting Edge, has got to get, and they've got to get involved. And I mean, I'm sure they're watching these podcasts, we know they are. And they're going through the list of everything that we're talking about and clearing, making it all clear in their shop. And I mean, Tim, you can clean it up as much as you want, and you should for your staff that are there. But the biggest thing that happens with the PBCC is that you can clean it up in there, but you need [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3084s) take accountability for the past.

It is why we are bringing the past, flopping it down in the present so that everybody can have accountability. It has to, just because you change something and go on with your life, you still have to turn around and talk and take accountability for those people that it affected. This is, I mean, there's even, there's a lot of people, right, that get caught up with us dwelling on the past. And, "Oh, you just gotta let it go, [Cheryl,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3114s) let it go." No, you don't let shit go because how do you change your future if you don't lift up the past, look at what happened, dissect it, and then be like, "Okay."

When people have felt like there's been accountability taken hold, like that's all I'm asking for. Bruce Hales just needs to call me. Just call me, Bruce. I'll have a conversation with you. Oh, you know, that's all that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3144s) is, accountability. That's what accountability looks like, right? Anyhow, I'm gonna get lost in that run. There's something else I wanted to bring up, Terri, because we did not get through everything last one and so I've made notes so that we get through some of the stuff here. You were telling me about a time when Garth came to you, I mean, I know he always would take your phone and he'd watch porn on it, but he would ask you.

Yeah, so he came in one time and he had asked, I'm talking about the story when he'd asked you to lay naked with them because he was watching stuff with his cousins that were up from the States that they were watching this, obviously he was watching porn. Go ahead and tell us this story.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3188s)

So he, that's when he, like he came at me in the spray booth, and he asked me if I would lay down with him. Or no, he said that cousins had come up from the States to visit and they had brought magazines with naked pictures in it of men and women laying down together. And he asked me if I had, if I would lay down with him [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3222s) naked like in the pictures.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3225s)

That is so fucked. The way he described a porn mag, like literally his description of a porn mag should ring a million alarm bells.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3238s)

Yeah, yeah. And then one, sorry, that has no place in a workplace ever, ever.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3244s)

No, no. You you will be fired faster than shit. Like this is, oh, that's so...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3253s)

They were glad to get rid of someone who had chosen not to walk with them. You know, they were glad to kick her out of a job, the youngest of however many children whose father had just passed away. And yet you've got a young guy there that's discussing porn mags and propositioning another worker in their shop and they do nothing about it. Tim Bond, that is ridiculous. You're not a mainstream Christian business. That's ridiculous.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3283s)

And Alan and Garth hit on me on the same day. Like on the same day.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3289s)

Oh, they need to be locked up. That's just my personal...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3293s)

They do need to be locked up.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3294s)

And it's literally the same language. Like he used the same language. It was the same MO. It was the same, "Like my special, would you be my special friend?" Like just...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3312s)

Oh, that makes my, makes my hair want to stand up. Like creepy. Oh.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3318s)

And did you not tell me that Tim's young kids would come into the shop and Arden's kids would come into the shop and spend time in the shop? Was that you told me that? Yeah. So why would you bring your children and put them in this kind of an atmosphere? Obviously, he has no judgment of it because he's exposing his children to it. That's what carries on generation after generation after generation. There is no judgment of it. You allow it in your workplace, you act on it in [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3348s) workplace. This is your leadership style and you tell me you're leading a mainstream Christian church? I don't think so. There's nothing mainstream about porn.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3357s)

Nothing. To those people that think Alan and Garth are not the church, yeah, they are. They belong to the same church. Yeah. This is pedophile that we're talking about. This is sexual harassment. This is, yes, yes, it is a part of the church. Absolutely, it is a part of the church, especially when their boss is leading that church.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3376s)

Yeah, and you're allowing this culture in your workplace. You're exposing your very own children to it. Shows you have no judgment of it. Their children were doing it, yeah, right along with them. I'm absolutely horrified. I really thought better of Tim and Lisa than that. Training little narcissists. Yeah, really.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3398s)

Yeah. There was another thing that we didn't touch on last time is when you had started growing your hair out. I just want to kind of just round up all the comments Alan would make to you about, you know, when your piercings were out and you had long hair and when you had gained some weight. Do you want to talk about that?

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3420s)

Oh my God, he would come in every morning. It was the first thing he would do. He would go in, he would come in, he'd visit me and stop into the spray booth, put his arm around me, put his hand on my shoulder and on my back, whatever. And of course, I'm locked in the spray booth, my back is to the door, I face the wall. So my back's to the door and you can't hear anything [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3450s) you're wearing ear protection and it's so loud in there, like definitely loud. You can't hear anybody come up from behind you.

So I mean, I used to lock myself in there with bungee cords so he couldn't come in. Yeah, but he would come in and remark about my hair. "Oh, you're growing your hair long, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3480s) good, that's the way you should." So I shaved it off. He noticed that my piercing, I didn't even know when I had lost it, but it had been a while obviously because it had closed in. And he said, "Oh, I'm so glad you don't have the piercing, the metal in your face anymore." He's like, "I'm glad you took my advice and got rid of it."

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3512s)

Oh, the arrogance. The fucking arrogance.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3514s)

He told me, he told me to take my piercings out. He told me to grow my hair long. He told me to dress differently. He told me, like I said, when I went camping with my boyfriend and took an extra day off for the weekend, I came back to work and he said, "I thought we had something special. How could you step out on me?" And then when you were gaining weight, what did he tell you to do? So then I started gaining weight because I was on so many [steroids.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3545s)

I was having injuries. I was there with stitches in my hand. I was there, I worked on broken feet. I worked with casts on my hand. I worked with an IV in my hand. I was on steroids covering all of the injuries. And so I started gaining weight and he was, "Getting a little fat there. You better start walking. It's starting [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3575s) get out of hand." Yeah. So that kind of stuff. So when he remarked about the piercings, I got more piercings. I think I threw in a tattoo, another tattoo.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3598s)

But you, I mean, there was, so at around this kind of time, right? So his wife had gotten sick. I just want to kind of go with your belief. Like what it felt like for you, you had mentioned, like you felt like they were grooming you to be his wife.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3616s)

It felt like that. Like, yeah, I remember, I remember him saying something about his wife. And I remember Bev, I think that she was quite sick, that his wife was quite sick. And then that's, he, that he started showing up at my house and knocking on my door, following me to the pharmacy, following me through the grocery store. Like everywhere he went, everywhere when I left work for any reason, Alan was behind me in his van and he waited outside everywhere I went. And he showed up at my door asking to help me. "I can help you if you would just let me in. I can help you. I can take care of you." So, yeah. It was...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3689s)

Yeah. He's a predator that needs to go to jail.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3692s)

Yeah, he is.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3693s)

That's just my opinion. I have to say that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3697s)

I agree. So, Hunter, when you worked there, at any point did you ever see OHS come in and inspect the place or do anything?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3697s)

No, never.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3697s)

Yeah, OHS needs to go there and they need to catch them without them knowing that they're coming.

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3722s)

Yeah, I agree. Yeah, because they do, they do call ahead of time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3727s)

Yeah, they should. When they're just doing a regular inspection, unless there's like a report or an accident. They need to be a company that has cameras installed and that the government has access to those cameras all the time, like they do on their people.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3748s)

Yeah, they need to have cameras everywhere throughout that building, except bathrooms, of course, and have it with audio too so you can hear their fucking comments.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3757s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3765s)

You know what gets me really bad too is some of these brethren businesses have the audacity to come to people and be like, "Don't use the Lord's name in vain in our building. Don't use, you can't say Jesus Christ," right? 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3784s)

Yeah. You know, I actually had talked to a couple insiders regarding swearing, right? I mean, I've got a bad mouth. Lane's got a bad mouth. Oh, yeah. Anyhow, and I actually, both the insiders that I talked to told me that like, the amount of swearing that happens in there, that what I say on a podcast is nothing compared to how they talk. And like, I mean, using the C-word and everything. I [mean,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3814s) that's even something that in my mouth, I don't throw out unless I'm really angry. And the C-word's not cult.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3827s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3828s)

But again, in Australia, they throw it out like "bro," right? So it's just, they do. I mean, there's actual video with Australian members saying that word.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3833s)

But my point is, if people get upset.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3841s)

Yeah, there you go. My point is, if people get sensitive ears, right? Sensitive ears. I just want to explain to them that sometimes when you stub your toe, "freaking gosh darn it" just doesn't cut it. It just doesn't cut it. And in the real world, I know in the church, they say "freaking" and "freaking oh my goodness" and "gosh darn it" and stuff, but in the normal world, if you go around and say those swear words, people are going to look at you be like, "Are you okay? Is everything going, [you meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3871s) right? You meant, fuck right? Why are you just coloring it something else? We know what you meant."

Uh, anyway, oh, I had another joke about the church because someone pointed out to me that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church actually has broken many Guinness World Records because, so they say, once every couple of months, they have three-day meetings, they call them. So it's three days of church meetings and they invite people from all over the world. [There's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3901s) hundreds of people there and all the people between the age of 18 and 25 that aren't married are all virgins. Like all of them. So this is the biggest gathering of virgins in the world happens in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3925s)

But I just say that that number's probably not that high.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3932s)

No, they definitely are people breaking that rule, but that's one of their big sacrilegious rules. Like, do not have premarital sex because you go straight to the bad place.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3941s)

Oh yeah, oh yeah, the bad place.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3944s)

And then they wonder why they have such issues with with sexual deviants and and pedophilia, right? Because you people are are so just weird about sex and so insane about it that you have turned it into this terrible thing where you have people that are becoming sexual deviants and predators and they're gonna go to jail.

### [**Terri Smith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3968s)

It's because it's an obsession.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3971s)

No, and I think that's probably why that, you know, in Cutting Edge's experience, right, where the catcalling comes from and the air horn comes from and you know, because those men are not taught at all on how to, what's going on in their body, right? And that there's no way to express it in any way.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=3989s)

Yeah. Yeah, like let me explain it to some brethren members that might be in there listening, okay? It's not what she's fucking wearing. It's where your eyes and mind are going. And if you can't control yourself, that is a you problem. You need to go maybe to the bathroom and watch some fucking porn, okay? Sort yourself out because something's wrong with you, not the girl.

### **Terri Smith**

You borrow your cousin's magazine.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4025s)

Anyhow, okay, we should probably wrap this up. Hunter, is there anything else you want to add?

### [**Hunter Briggs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4031s)

Not really. Like I said, I don't have anything like particularly crazy like what...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4037s)

Oh no, what you went through was crazy, love.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4039s)

Yes, it was. And thanks tons for sharing. Thanks, thanks very much.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4043s)

Grateful to have you on. I was really appreciative that you came on here and got to be able to tell your side of things and also support what Terri went through. Terri, again, we're so grateful that you came on and you're not going to be any stranger to the show, you know that. Anyhow, okay, thank you guys very much for joining us today and thanks everyone for listening. Until next time.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4070s)

Cheers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h6i0hu_d9M&t=4071s)

Much love to you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
*   **Rapid Relief Team (RRT)** – The PBCC's emergency and disaster relief organization, generally recognised as a corporate sanitizing and PR initiative.
*   **Gospel Hall Trusts**  – Legal entities that own and maintain PBCC meeting halls and church properties across various regions.
