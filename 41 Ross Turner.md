## Summary

TRIGGER WARNING This podcast contains discussions about suicide. Viewer discretion is advised
Join us as we explore with Ross Turner how it feels to be in the brethren and gay. Ross describes how he was told therapy sessions would ‘make him straight’ and how he had to deal with the feelings of worthlessness not only because he was gay but also because he had been born into a community who would never accept him the way he was. He recounts the effect this attitude had on his family and speaks with emotion over how he was not able to even say goodbye to his Mother. His story demonstrates the controlling methods employed by the brethren to try to make someone conform to their ways, and how that sent him into a mental spiral of addictions to try to cope with the pressure. Nine years later, Ross has overcome these additions and has found freedom in life with his partner. Ross finishes with a heartfelt message for anyone in the brethren who is gay.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life podcast,Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=23s)

Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with my friends Anne and Carmen and Gilli and we're joined tonight by a very special guest, Ross Turner.

Ross left the Brethren some years ago and he's going to share with us his story about how he left, why he left, how he was treated, and what effect it's had on him since then and how he's managing it.

Hello Ross, how are you?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=51s)

Hello Jacky, how are you? Hi, I'm doing okay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=58s)

Good, good. So Ross, thank you very much for joining us on Get A Life Podcast. Perhaps you could just start right at the beginning by telling us approximately when you left the Brethren and then maybe what led up to you leaving?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3DQeft44uSo24%26t%3D73s)

Okay, yeah. So I was actually kicked out, withdrawn from, by the PBCC in June 2014\. Yeah, do you want to have a bit of background as to where I was born and whatnot as well? Yeah, what led up to that?

So basically I was born in 1978 in Peterborough, so I'm a third generation [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=103s) Exclusive Brethren member, ex obviously now. So mum and dad were born into it. My grandparents joined in the early 1900s, around about in the 1920s. So growing up, we weren't very well off at all. Basically, we were at the bottom of the pecking order.

And I can remember after the church meetings, us three boys, we got picked on a lot, got made fun of, told that we smell and all the rest of it because obviously we didn't, but you know we weren't the flavor of the month as it were. But when we weren't at meetings we were happy, we had a really nice, happy life. We actually got away with a lot of [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=157s) that a lot of other youngsters in the meeting didn't. I mean for instance, we went out on a lot of day trips with my parents and I know there was some in the locality that, you know, they wouldn't go out for days at all.

So in 1986-87, dad had a nervous breakdown after trying to run his own business for quite a while. He had a packaging business that he tried to run, and I think what finally put the nail in the coffin [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=187s) him was he was asked to preach and he did preach on one of the gospels on Sunday, and he was told by one of the local priests that he wasn't qualified. And that put the final nail in the coffin for him and he basically had a nervous breakdown.

So we had to go and live with another Brethren family which was quite traumatic, because obviously we weren't in our own home and this family took his business over, but it [failed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=221s) again in 1990 and they made him redundant. So yeah, it was a difficult period.

And then in 1988, Granny Turner came to live with us in an annex that we'd had built on the side of our house. We moved and a lot of the money from Gran's house went into our house so we could build the annex. I used to go in and see her every day and [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=252s) she used to tell me, it's like Gilli mentioning his podcast, tell me memories because she came from Wales and she used to tell me memories of all the old days in Wales. I used to love it, hearing all the old stories and whatnot, and it made me forget about all the crap that was going on after the meetings and the strain of dad having a nervous breakdown and struggling with his mental health.

But then in 1989 she died, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=283s) she was a big influence on me and she did have a big impact on my life as a youngster. And I haven't really spoken about this to anybody, but her death did leave a great big hole and I still miss her to this day. You know, it felt like part of me had been ripped out really. And after her death, I felt that I'd got nobody to confide in because my mum was busy dealing with my dad and my brothers didn't want to know really.

So, in 1990, as I say, my dad, his business failed, and it was shortly after this in 1991, this is when I realized I was going... you'll have to stop me if I'm going on too much. I know I was about to start secondary school and I remember there was a big discussion and I was forced by dad and mum to go to the same school as my brothers. This really, really upset me because all my Brethren friends I had at that time, you know, my close confidants, they all went to one school and I wanted to go to that school because obviously [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=356s) were all there and they would have been in the same year as me.

But instead, my dad and mum decided to put me in the school that my brothers were in, and we three were the only Brethren children in a school of about 700 pupils. And I was bullied really badly from the start because I had really bad acne at that time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=378s)

So just to clarify, at that time was a normal state school? The Brethren didn't have their own schools? No, this was a state school. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you and your brothers were the only three Brethren people?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=394s)

Yeah, people in the school of about 700 pupils, yes. And I was bullied really badly right from the start, right from the word go because I had really bad acne, so that didn't help. Plus the fact that we stood out because we didn't go into religious education, we couldn't go on field trips, you know, for geography and what have you. And it made me feel really alone and frightened.

And I was a loner all throughout secondary school. I didn't have any friends. When I was in primary school I had quite a few friends, but in secondary school I had absolutely none and I was a loner. And this is when one of my addictions started. So I started to masturbate to fantasy in a fantasy world as a way of escaping all the emotional pain that I was going through.

And also while I was in secondary school, because I knew about the sexuality, I started to bunk off PE and games because I was really embarrassed and scared that the boys would find out when we're in the changing rooms. And bearing in mind sort of like 1989, 1990 was a time when homosexuality was more taboo than it is now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=482s)

And I think it had, in the mid to late 80s, there was quite a stigma attached to homosexuality because of HIV, wasn't there? So quite apart from the Brethren issue in a school, it would have been difficult to contend with that anyway, I can imagine.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=501s)

Yeah, it was really difficult to contend with. That's as I say why I started to bunk off PE in games because obviously when you're in the changing room after having a shower, it's, well, we don't need to go into that. But yes, and my nerves and anxiety were getting worse all the time and I actually would look at it more like a cry for help. I tried to actually commit suicide a couple of times while I was in [secondary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=533s) school. And I look at it now as more of a cry for help because I did want to die, but I didn't want to die. So it was, each attempt was sort of like a half-hearted attempt, really.

And around this time, also, as I mentioned before, so I'm going off-piste a bit, but as I mentioned before, dad failed in business and the family he was working for made him redundant. And this again highlights how we were bottom of the pecking order because there was another brother that worked for a worldly firm and he got made redundant and he was given a job by a Brethren firm. And yet my dad was made redundant and none of the Brethren would have him to work their businesses.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=595s)

He was overlooked.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=596s)

In the end, he just got a job as a cleaner, literally a cleaner in the Perkins Engines in Peterborough, which obviously he absolutely hated. And I remember waking up in the mornings to the sound of my mum and brothers forcing him out of bed, which usually ended with my mum screaming at him and my brothers screaming at him. And I was just there with my hands over my head just trying to blot it all out because, you know, obviously I was going through all [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=626s) was going through at secondary school as well. So that was, you know, I didn't need all that as well.

So fast forward a few years, so by the time I was ready to do my GCSEs, my nerves were in shreds from all the bullying and sexuality, the shame I felt of being gay, and also obviously having an addiction to masturbating. And as a result of this, I didn't do any revision and even missed some of the exams because I was so worked up and hence I didn't get the grades I could have done. Because obviously I missed the exams, but you know, I was in all the top classes at school, but I didn't get very good grades at all and I put that totally down to the stigma of being gay and being bullied. But it is what it is, you know, it happened.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=680s)

So just to pause for a moment, I know when Ben Woodbury spoke so bravely about his secondary school years, and he said a lot of the problems was there was nobody he could go to to talk about the feelings he was having. Did you find that was the same for you?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=698s)

Yes, yes, definitely. Obviously, I couldn't talk to anybody in the Brethren about it. I think if my gran had still been alive, she would have probably, although she wouldn't have agreed with it, she would have understood. Because she was a lovely person, she really was. And I couldn't go to anybody at school about it because again, as we said before, you know, homosexuality then was a lot more taboo than it is now. So I had nobody that I could turn to at all.

So in those days, sort of like mid-90s, it was said by the then leader John Hales that you would have to attend sixth form after you've done your GCSEs. But what happened in my case, I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=759s) actually go to sixth form because, well, I just didn't. So I actually did a couple of years of home study. And my home study was a retake of GCSE maths. And also I started a course of GCSE physics. So for anybody listening outside the UK, GCSE is the grade you get before you go to advanced level.

It was open learning and I worked from home and I sent off the work to be marked by a tutor in Wales, so there wasn't much support for the courses at all. And because of this, I was struggling with my physics course, so I asked a local young brother who was still single to help me. And this led to the young people of my age at the local meeting starting talking behind my back, saying that I was trying to get into that brother's trousers, that I was gay, etc, etc. And that I was in love with him and all sorts of disgusting things were being said behind my back.

And I had nobody to fight my corner at all. I mean, if I'm being completely honest now, I think I did fall in love with him at the time. I was so messed up. And also at this time, my eldest brother was still at home, my middle brother got married by that time, and he was going on at me as well, telling me I was weird, telling me I was gay, and again saying that I was trying to get into [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=866s) brother's trousers. So I hadn't only got it at the church meetings, I'd got it at home as well. I'd got it basically 24/7, really.

So because of this, I started drinking heavily as well as the other addiction that I've already mentioned, the masturbation. I just wanted to blot everything out because I was so distressed and by that time I was a nervous wreck. So the young brother that was helping me with the physics course, he also took an interest in my mental health at the time and I found myself telling him about how I felt, you know, how alone and frightened and scared, etc, that I was.

And some of the things I told him must have made him think I was gay because unbeknownst to me, he told our local priest about it. And my nerves were starting to getting worse and worse and worse and it got to the point in the end that my family had to call out our GP in the middle of the night because I'd finally, it had all become too much and I'd had a nervous breakdown. And that would be about the age of 18 or 19, so I was really young.

So a few weeks later, I told my brother about my masturbating and the next thing I knew, the priest came around to tell us that we were shut up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=953s)

Because of that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=955s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=957s)

Sorry. Because of the masturbation, we were shut up. That was the reason.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=962s)

And as others have said, you know, obviously they tried to get me to confess to all sorts of other things that, you know, I hadn't done at all. We were treated really badly actually, badly. And I remember one time they came around, I basically said, no, I'm not talking to you, and I went off for a walk with my middle brother because, well no, with my older brother, sorry, I've got it wrong, my middle brother was still at home at that time.

So we were shut up for about six weeks and I remember that in the end I started to confess to all sorts of different things because I just wanted to get back to the meetings for some sense of normality, to the church meetings. So after six weeks, we were allowed back and the priests basically said because of the nature of what I'd originally been [shut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1023s) up for, I wouldn't have to actually say anything in the meeting, which I was quite thankful for.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1029s)

That's no bad thing.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1030s)

No, it's not a bad thing too. I was really thankful because I, you know, I was...

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1035s)

Crapping myself.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1036s)

Yeah.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1037s)

Yeah, yeah. You shouldn't have been having to confess about it anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1042s)

No. I want to pause there because I find that quite an interesting concept and it was actually something that happened to my father. He was accused of something he didn't do and he got shut up because he didn't admit to it. And I don't understand because obviously a similar thing happened to you, Ross, having admitted to one thing. And let's be clear about the one thing you admitted to, in the majority of the world's opinion, that is not a sin. You know, it is [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1072s) normal part of growing up, particularly for boys.

And so having got that, and it's then that mental pressure of trying to make you to confess to things that you know you didn't do, but you end up thinking, oh, well, I'll say I did because it will get them off my back. And I don't understand. And I understand how you felt because I saw my father go through a similar thing and he just had a nervous breakdown too. But what is that about?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1103s)

I think they just, I don't know, they like to get more gory details. And yes, but in Peterborough there was a culture at that time of, it was almost a game to the priests about who they could shut up. Because I remember, I actually wrote this on a comment on one of the other podcasts, that at that time you would go to a Tuesday night meeting, which they called the ministry meeting, and you'd be thinking, oh, who's going to be shut [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1133s) this week or who's going to be withdrawn from this week. Inevitably, there would be somebody. And that happened week after week after week.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1144s)

There was a lot of young people in Peterborough at that time that were withdrawn from, yeah. Yeah. For absolute minimal things.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1156s)

Yeah. That was mid to early, well, it was during the 90s, basically, was the heyday that it happened. So that was that. We got back to the meetings. So when we were allowed back to the meetings, I was offered a job with some Brethren in Kings Lynn, of whom we've already mentioned them in conversation, but I was offered a job with some Brethren in Kingston, and I was told that I would be the best paid employee, have a lovely house, etc.

The reality actually was that they put me on less than the minimum wage, promising a hefty bonus each year. [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1196s) never materialised. In fact, it got so bad that their accountant said, look, you need to start paying more, or else he could actually turn around and report you to the HMRC because you're not even paying your minimum wage.

Basically, they got me in there to do their accounts, which was fine, but it ended up that I was a jack of all trades. I was typing up invoices, I was serving on the trade counter, I was doing purchasing. They treated me like a slave basically, is what it boils down to. So the first thing they made me do was come off all the medication that my GP had put me on, bearing in mind I was vulnerable at this time, so I just did what they said basically.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1244s)

How did they put that to you? Because for non-qualified medical people to suggest somebody comes off prescribed medications, I mean, how did they suggest to you that that was a good idea?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1259s)

Just by telling me that A, I didn't need it and B, you know, God would take care of it and all the rest of it. And I was so vulnerable at the time that, you know, I thought, yeah, they must be right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1272s)

It just goes to show the sort of, the reason I pulled up on that point is because sometimes I think when you've not been in the situation of this totalitarian control, it's very hard to understand. I totally understand why you came off your medication because they told you, and I think all of us on this podcast would as well. But I think an outside person would kind of think, well, why didn't you just say no? But it's very difficult to describe the control they have, particularly [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1303s) you feel so worthless.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1304s)

Yeah, yeah. And I was feeling totally worthless at the time because obviously I was still struggling with my sexuality and all the rest of it as well. Yes, yes. So it got, work got worse and worse over the next few years to the point that one of the partners, the younger partner, was trying to control every aspect of my life, even down to what I should be eating in my packed lunch. And enough was enough by then.

So in the end, in [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1334s) 2003, I was off sick from work because I'd been diagnosed with double renal failure a few years before. So at the moment, my, and obviously it still continues to this day, at the moment my kidneys are working at about 30% between the two of them. So I was off work around 2012, off work with a really bad kidney infection and I just wrote to them and said, I won't be returning.

They never replied. I never got a reply. All I got was my P45 in the post. So anybody that's not from the UK, a P45 is what your employer gives you. That's your final thing so that you can let for your tax so that you can and then give that to your new employee so they know what tax code you're on, etc.

So I started claiming benefits and that is where my spending addiction started. And also during this time, because of my kidney failure, I was in quite a lot of [pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1409s), so I got addicted to prescription painkillers, Tramadol, which is almost like, it's almost like heroin basically. So yeah, in about 2003 was when my spending addiction started.

So I'd go down to London on spending sprees, opening credit cards left, right and center, even though there was absolutely no way I could afford all the repayments. I mean, this was in the early 2000s, this was in the climate where the banks were lending willy-nilly anyway to anybody. No proper due checks were being done. So I remember I went to, I opened a store card with one of the major retailers and they immediately gave me a credit of 5,000 pounds, which in this day and age would never happen now. No, no.

So I ended up by maxing all the credit cards out with a debt of about 15,000 pounds in the end. And obviously, all this time, I was still in active addiction with the drinking, the masturbating and also obviously painkillers. And I was so overwhelmed with everything. Again, I tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of the Tramadol painkillers I was on. And, you know, I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. Because basically, all that happened was, is I slept for 24 hours, and then I woke up as right as rain afterwards. So I was obviously, I was obviously meant to live.

So for the next 10 years after 2003 to 2013, I did various part-time jobs for different Brethren firms and this really brings me to the part where, you know, my actual leaving story. So the brother I was working for suggested I spoke to a psychiatrist at the Priory. So again, for anybody that's outside the UK, the Priory is a [private](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1550s) chain of hospitals that deal solely with addictions. They're not cheap. So do you want me to go on or is there anything? No, no. Carry on whilst you carry on.

So yeah, so the brother I was working for suggested I spoke to the psychiatrist from the Priory in Bristol. So this resulted for me in me being an inpatient at the Priory for seven weeks from about end of March to middle of May 2013\.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1592s)

Can I just ask who paid for that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1595s)

So yeah, I'm just coming to that actually. Sorry, sorry. No, valid, it was a valid point. So all this treatment was paid for by the Brethren in the form of a loan, bearing in mind that they call it the addiction treatment program, which is four weeks and that's 15,000 pounds. I was in there for seven weeks, so there was obviously three weeks extra. So the actual final bill came to around about 23,000-24,000 pounds. [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1627s) yeah, the money for the treatment, as I say, was paid for by the Brethren in the form of a loan. So in order for them to do this, I had to agree to attend meetings and conform to their way of life.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1643s)

Although they loaned, did you... that's okay. Well, I was going to ask, when you say you had to agree, was that a verbal agreement or did they get you to sign something? Or was it just, you know, we'll pay for it and...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1654s)

I can't, I think it was... I never, I definitely never ever signed anything. I think you'd remember, wouldn't you? Yeah, I mean, now whether they wanted me to and I just refused or whether it was just a verbal agreement, I can't remember.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1673s)

Yeah. And then the other question was, you say the Brethren paid for it. I'm always curious to understand, because these sorts of things happened after I left, is it one particular individual Brethren person or do they do it...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1688s)

From a trust or a fund or... This was literally probably about 15 or 20 individual Brethren giving money.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1700s)

I see.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1702s)

Some of it was to be, the vast lump of it was to be repaid, but other, the negligible amounts like 100 pounds here and there were just given as gifts. I see. When the Brethren were, there was some Brethren loans for like 2,000 or 3,000 pounds and that was expected to be paid back. I see.

So yeah, so obviously I went [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1732s) the Priory in 2013 and it was during this time that I told my parents and brothers that I was gay. This is actually when I came out because I felt in a safe environment to do so, because when you're in the Priory, you live there. You're not really exposed to the outside, well, you're in a bubble really.

And I remember my brother had actually come down to visit me to see how I was getting on, my middle brother Garth. I don't know if I'm allowed to mention his name or not, but that's my middle brother. And he basically had a massive rant at me, telling me how sinful it was and that God would punish me and I'd end up in hell and all sorts of disgusting things he was saying.

And it actually put me back slightly. I spoke, because the psychiatrist was obviously an approved psychiatrist of the brethren, you know, he was the approved one. But he was a Christian and I spoke to him about this and he said, well, to be honest, it will come back and something will happen really nasty to him because he's been so nasty to you. It's basically karma will come [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1817s) and get him at some point in his life.

And the therapists at the Priory told me that basically if I didn't leave the PBCC, as they now call themselves, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I'd most likely end up dead because of my addictions. And, you know, I've seen it happen. There was a sister I was local with who had an alcohol problem and she died way too young. So at that point, I thought that I'd be able to stay in the PBCC and just live as a celibate, single, gay man for the rest of my life.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1862s)

Did you at any point, because by now I'm trying to work out how old you would have been, but you certainly were... I was 35\. Okay. So at any point did you come under any pressure to get married? Because you obviously were way past what is perceived to be the normal marriageable age for Brethren men.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1882s)

I never, I never came under any pressure from the local Brethren. I mean, my brother married somebody from Lancaster and she's got a sister in Manchester and they've got girls and my mum was always trying to marry me off to one of these girls. And I just kept saying, no, mum, it's not going to happen, because I knew in my mind that there was no way I would get married if I was still [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1912s) there because A, it wouldn't be fair on me and B, it wouldn't be fair on whoever I married. Because I know for a fact we were local with somebody and I'm sure he's a closet guy and the marriage was so unhappy. I said, you know, I vowed to myself that I'd never do that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1935s)

Yeah, because I can understand that wouldn't be fair on either of you. No, you can never be true to yourself.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1942s)

So when I came out of the Priory in May 2013, the therapist, my psychiatrist there, wanted me to stay in Bristol for a year as an outpatient to attend all the 12-step support groups. Because basically, Bristol is one of the very few places that has got a good network of sex addiction 12-step meetings. So that is why they wanted me to stay in [Bristol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=1972s) for a year after I left the Priory. And the criteria that my psychiatrist set down was that I should stay in a supportive home with a stable environment.

Wherever I stayed, it was important that I was accepted for who I was, which obviously was never going to happen. It's not going to happen. So the first three months of the outpatient support program, I stayed in five different Brethren households. So bearing in mind I was supposed to live in one household for a year and I was pushed from pillar to post, five households in three months. So obviously that made me feel really, really unsettled.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2022s)

I was going to say that must have almost spiraled you back down again, I imagine, mentally.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2024s)

Yeah, it did. It did totally because I just felt I wasn't wanted anywhere. Yeah, yeah. Was that still in Bristol? Yeah, that was still in Bristol, yeah. So you're away from familiar surroundings anyway? Yeah, I mean, I was quite lucky because we had actually got relatives in Bristol. So, yeah, my cousin was quite good to me while I was down there. But even so, you know, it was really unsettling, really unsettling.

So in the end, I told them that I wanted to go back to Swaffham, where my parents were from. Obviously, they were from Peterborough originally, but Peterborough closed. That's a whole other story. Yes. So, yeah, they actually moved to Swaffham. And I will just say now, basically all the rich Brethren, Peterborough was split between two places. It was split between Stamford, which is about 15 miles north of Peterborough, and Swaffham, which is in Norfolk. Basically all the rich peebs went to Stamford and all the poor peebs went to Swaffham. That's what it boiled down to then.

So even when I returned to Swaffham, I wasn't allowed to return to my parents' house. Wow. Because I was told that if I did, I would probably relapse. So again, I just conformed really. So I had to stay with an older brother and sister. And I think it was at this point that the Brethren realized I was gay because obviously I told my brother and my parents. I mean, I've told you about my brother's reaction. My parents' reaction was just that, oh no, you can't be, it's not a thing, you know, it's just, it's just an idea you've got, it's a phase you're going through.

Yeah, I was hoping when I got back to Swaffham that... because the other place where there's a good network of sex addiction meetings is in London, so I was hoping when I went back to Swaffham that I'd be able to go to 12-step meetings down there. So obviously it's like Alcoholics Anonymous but for sex addiction. So they said that there was absolutely no way that I was allowed to go to these sex addiction meetings down in London because I'd be airing my sins in front of everybody, because obviously you share in the 12-step meetings.

So consequently, I had a relapse. I insisted that I went home to live with my parents because I was so unhappy with this brother and sister and I did end up having a relapse. And this was solely due to the fact that I was forbidden to go to the 12-step meetings, because when I was in Bristol, I was going to them regularly and they were really helping and I kept sober for a long time. So I was again admitted to the Priory for three weeks and again, the therapist told me that my addictions would kill me if I didn't leave the PBCC.

So this time when I was in, I actually started thinking quite seriously about leaving, right? But I got absolutely no idea how to go about it. And if I just go back a year or two, in the year or two before I went to the Priory, I wasn't really going to any meetings at all, not even the Supper. I was basically not attending meetings. So, but yeah, so when I went in December 2013, that's when I thought about, that's when I began to think seriously about leaving.

As I said, no idea how to go about it. But to be fair, after I left the Priory that time, the leading brother in Swaffham, he was quite, he was actually quite, he was a decent man really at heart, I have to say. He insisted that I should start going to the 12-step meetings in London.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2340s)

Okay, so you got there.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2342s)

Yeah, he said to the older brother and sister I was living with, he said, you were totally wrong to tell him that, you know, he needs these meetings. But this is the irony of the whole situation, is that he and another brother were sort of like looking after me at the time, and he and this other brother told me then that they thought that by me going to these 12-step meetings would turn me straight.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2385s)

In 12 quick steps. Yeah, we're all laughing but that's actually really sad and quite, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2405s)

It's so deluded. So, I was obviously going down to these 12-step meetings. And during this time, my sponsor had been googling and had come across the Wikipeebia Website. So yeah, I'm jumping ahead a bit. So in March 2014, I visited my psychiatrist I was under at the Priory and he said, basically, we've exhausted all the avenues within the PBCC. And the only way you're going to survive is if you leave. He said, you know, we've tried everything. We've tried putting you in Bristol for a year. That hasn't worked. You know, we've basically gone down every avenue we can.

So this was a catalyst that got me thinking really, really seriously about leaving. And obviously all this time I was going to my 12-step meetings in London. And obviously the Brethren didn't know this, but you go in these 12-step meetings, you go to the meetings and then afterwards quite often you go out for coffee and just have a general chat with the other members. So I was actually mixing with normal people when I was going down to London. Obviously the Brethren didn't know anything about it. It would have been stopped straight away.

So yeah, my sponsor in the 12-step meetings had been googling and he'd come across the Wikipeebia Website. So I got in touch with them and I got a lot of useful advice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2515s)

So can I just clarify for the non-ex-Brethren, it was called the Wikipeebia Website, wasn't it? And it was the website set up with information about the Brethren. And it had a red panic button that you could push if you were in the Brethren and wanted some help. And there were people working in the background. And ultimately, I think it was certainly around in the time you're saying, but ultimately, it got shut [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2545s) through legal action, didn't it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2546s)

Oh okay, I didn't realize that. Yes, it did, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2550s)

Yeah, yeah, it did. So but just to explain what the Wikipeebia Website as opposed to Wikipedia is. Yeah, sorry, carry on.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2563s)

Ross, the psychiatrist that told you that...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2570s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2571s)

Did the Brethren know that he was telling you that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2574s)

No, not at all. In fact, just after I was withdrawn from, I think it was a care-meeting, it was June, June care-meeting 2014, I think it was the 5th or 6th of June, my mum said to me, oh, I wish we'd never ever let you see that psychiatrist. But he was the Brethren-approved one.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2604s)

Yeah, that's why I was asking, because a Brethren-approved one...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2608s)

Yeah, yeah. He was actually really decent. He wasn't like the ones they've got now that basically tell, you know, tell you whatever costs, stay in the Brethren sort of thing. He was actually, he was good. He was really good.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2621s)

And they let you go to him all by yourself? Like you didn't have to have somebody chaperone you? Like some of the, some of the ones that have seen psychiatrists say they're not allowed to go there by themselves, like you have to take an elder with you or something.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2636s)

Yeah, I mean, while I was in the Priory, I was seeing him and somebody came with me, I had a chaperone all the time. But then I basically in the end, I said, no, look, I need to go and see him by myself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2647s)

Good for you, good for you.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2649s)

Yeah, and to their credit, they did let me. So yeah. The chat from the Wikipeebia Website gave me a lot of advice. So for instance, the first email I sent him, I sent on my work computer, my work laptop, and he came back, and I was quite fortunate because my parents didn't actually have their internet through the Brethren. I don't know whether the Brethren control, you know, have whether [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2687s) have to buy their internet through UBT now, Universal Business Team, because obviously they didn't when I was leaving. So my parents just had a normal internet service.

But the Wikipeebia Website said to me, well, you do need to realise that the Brethren can track every tap of the keyboard, every tap, everything you look at, they can track. So that was really useful advice actually. And that is one thing I'd say to anybody that is thinking of leaving, is either go to the library, which is what I did to start with, or get your own device, which is what I subsequently did.

So yeah, so I'd made several friends at the 12-step meetings and one time I went down, I actually packed a suitcase with some belongings and left it with one of my friends in case I suddenly had to leave, if the Brethren suddenly turned around and said to me, right, that's it, you're out of the house, you know, go. I mean, obviously my mum sort of said, why are you taking that suitcase to London with you? And I was sort of like saying, well, my friend does eBay and I'm just taking a whole load of old clothes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2776s)

Oh, and she believed it, did she?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2781s)

She didn’t quite understand why the suitcase didn't come back with me, but yeah. So I did that. And then during this time, I'd also obviously, as I said before, I got myself a normal phone contract and I installed Facebook. And I used Facebook to connect with other ex-members and also obviously to join all the ex-EB groups on there. And actually while, and during that period, I actually met up with a couple of people that were out in London. Am I allowed to name names or not?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2829s)

Yes, I don't see why not.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2831s)

I met up with Laurie Moffitt and I also met up with Jill Mytton. Yeah. And Gerard Rayment, I think, was the other one I met up with. Yes. Yes. So yeah, I actually think that I may have been followed to London. I didn't actively notice it, but this was just before I was withdrawn from.

So yeah, I've actually got the date here. So on Saturday, the 7th of June 2014, it was the care-meeting, which for non-Brethren members, the care-meeting is held on a Saturday. When I was in, it was held, I think, at nine o'clock in the morning. It used to be six o'clock in the morning. That is where they, if there's any, because it used to be on the Tuesday night meeting, but they changed it that any shunning or withdrawing from, that was all discussed at the care-meeting. So anyway, 7th of June 2014, after the care-meeting, my dad came home and he said in a very hushed voice, you've been withdrawn from.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2914s)

Yeah. So can I pause there because you just want to paint a picture of what this would have meant. You weren't at that care-meeting? No. And in that care-meeting, presumably one person on your behalf would have said something about Ross Turner has been whatever it was they decided to withdraw from you for. And they would have said, we have to no longer walk with or we withdraw from our brother. And the whole congregation would probably have [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2944s) amen. Yeah. And you did not know that this was going to happen?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2949s)

No, I didn't. I mean, obviously I wasn't going to the meetings by that point.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2954s)

No, but they had no idea that...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2956s)

No, I think if I had been going to the meetings, I would have probably been told not to go.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2964s)

Yeah. So there was no visit, like no priestly visit where you had a chance to defend yourself?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=2973s)

Yeah. So, I mean, I was going to come to this, but I can come to this now, actually. Basically, as we mentioned before, there was this single brother that helped me with my physics course. He was actually, he actually moved to Swaffham. And this is how the Brethren are really clever. They sent him round to try and remonstrate with me, because they'd obviously known that in the past...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3006s)

You had a soft spot for him.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3008s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I just, I just basically said to him, I don't want to know. And the priests did come round after the care-meeting. I can't remember if it was just before, but basically when they did come round, I told them that A, I didn't believe in the doctrine of separation and B, I didn't regard Bruce Hales as the Man of God.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3050s)

So again, for any, I don't know whether you want to explain what the Man of God is, Jacky. I think probably most people do, but the Man of God is the supreme leader, isn't it? Bruce Hales, and it was John Hales his father before then. And he has ultimate control over the whole group and what he says goes. Yeah. And yeah, absolutely. So, so did they tell you what they actually withdrew you from you for? What did they tell the Brethren your, your crime, and I put it in inverted commas, was?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3076s)

So the reason that they gave, excuse me, was that I'd been using Facebook to communicate with other ex-members.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3091s)

Let's just pause there. So you've been on Facebook. Can I just put that into context? You've been on Facebook talking to ex-members who, incidentally, most of them are now your friends. Yeah. And that results in them withdrawing from your church, which results in you losing your family, your home, your job and everything. Because you're on Facebook talking to some ex-members.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3116s)

Yeah. And what makes me laugh is that Brethren aren't allowed Facebook. So how do they know that I was on Facebook? Well, this is... I mean, I do know now they do have people policing Facebook.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3132s)

Yes, they do. We know that, but we didn't know that at the time. Yeah, and technically if you asked them, they would say they have a scripture to back up every assembly action. Yeah. Do you know if one for that one? Where in the scriptures does it say Facebook is evil?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3154s)

Oh, it would have been something about the compromise with those that are already left.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3159s)

Yeah, there would be some tenuous link to something, wouldn't it? Yeah.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3164s)

I mean, when they withdrew from me, it was just because I hadn't been to the Lord's Supper for so long.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3173s)

That was it. That was it. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3177s)

Well, I was never ever told why I was withdrawn from, so I still wonder to this day whether I was. Go on, Ross.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3187s)

I think what really got to them though was that I literally wouldn't tell them who it was I'd been speaking to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3193s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3193s)

And that would have really... Oh yeah, at that time. That would have happened.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3198s)

Yeah, in 2014 that would have happened.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3199s)

2014, there were some people that you were talking to that were not liked.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3206s)

Yeah. By you,Laurie Moffat and Jill Mytton. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3213s)

So, yeah. So what happened next after that Saturday?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3217s)

What happened next was that when, so they came to visit me after the care-meeting just to tell me officially that I'd been withdrawn from. I mean, I laugh at it because I say, well, I must have been particularly bad because I didn't even go through the shut up phase. I went straight to withdrawn. Straight.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3240s)

It was talking to those ex-members that did it, Ross.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3248s)

So they came around to tell you, yeah, they came around to tell me officially. And then on the Monday morning, I was told that work wanted their laptop back. And so it was obvious from this that I no longer had a job, even though again, I never heard from work directly about it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3270s)

So at this point, were you still living with your parents, in your parents' house?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3274s)

I was just gonna, yeah, yeah. So obviously, yeah, I was still living at home with my parents at this point. I had to live completely separately. So my parents weren't allowed to eat with me or be in the same room as me. So basically, when they were at home, I had to confine myself to my bedroom while they had the run of the house. And then obviously when they went out to meetings, I had the run of the house then.

And I think, like others have said, they were coming from an unclean place, so they had to go to somebody else's house before they could go to the meeting. Yeah, I've heard this. To cleanse themselves of you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3323s)

Oh my word.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3327s)

My children, at whatever age they were, had to go to my parents' house for 10 minutes.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3333s)

Dear God. What happens if it's nine minutes and 50 seconds? About a month of it been like this. So this would have been early July 2014\. My parents actually moved out of their home, and I think it was probably on advice from the Brethren. So first they went to live with my brothers and then they went to live with a relative up in Liverpool. So they told me the situation was untenable and that I'd have to find my own place.

So I told them that this would be really difficult because I didn't have the funds to find my own place. I hadn't saved any money at all because I hadn't got any money, basically. So they were away from the house for about three to four weeks. And in that time, I wasn't allowed to speak to them on the phone or anything. And I wasn't contacted by the Brethren at all.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3411s)

So how did that, how did that make you feel? Because I know you were very close to your mother. I mean, I know that because I know you. How did that make you feel at that time, Ross, in those three or four weeks?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3426s)

It made me feel awful. Yeah, I felt so guilty. I felt, you know, it's a job to put in, I don't know, I don't know what to say. I don't want to start blubbing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3446s)

You can, it's fine. I mean, just on that point, if it's okay Ross, I think you did send me a couple of letters you'd written to your parents.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3454s)

Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3455s)

Yeah. And there was one that I think perhaps demonstrates, just a paragraph from it, that demonstrates how the control they were under and how it made you feel. And I'll read it out, just a sentence or two if that's okay. You say, this is a letter you wrote to your parents, and you say;

 "It makes me sad to see how the Brethren are controlling you and smothering the natural motherly instincts you have. A prime example of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3485s) is when you took me down one day to catch a train to London while I was still living at home just after I was withdrawn from. You dropped me off and I asked if I could have a kiss and you replied you couldn't because that would be a breach of the fellowship."

You're okay, Ross. Yeah. I have to say this hurt me deeply because the Brethren obviously meant more to you than your own son. And I think probably, Ross, you're okay. You're doing great. Sorry, sorry there. Don't apologize. I know this would mean a lot to you. We spoke about this. Take your time. Yeah, we spoke about this. But I think that's so important because A, you can see there's nothing to divide Ross and his mother apart from the Brethren's doctrine of separation. And she actually felt to give her own son a kiss was a breach of that fellowship. It's just, it's just, like I have no words.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3544s)

Just to give a bit of background to that, in the last few years that I was at home, my dad was starting to slowly lose his mind, right? And me and my mum were like that because we had to hold everything together basically. Yeah. And we were, we were extremely, extremely close. Yeah. So yeah, basically, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3575s) yeah, so they told me that I needed to get my own place. And I was so distressed and so stressed during this time, obviously with all the guilt with my parents having to leave home and all the rest of it, that I literally rang one of the leading brothers to say that I'd been with my position and that I'd actually like to get right and be able to come back into fellowship.

Because I was that desperate, because I was hurting so much, I was that desperate that I actually thought, yeah, I'd actually like to go back. And after a few days, he ran back and he said, well, you'll still have to find your own place anyway while you get right. So I thought, well, you know, if that's the case, I may as well just find my own place and make a go of it out of the peebs once and for all. Yeah, if I've got to find my own place anyway, I might as well find a place of my own and make a life out here rather than [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3650s) finding a place temporarily and then going back to the hell that, you know, was in there.

So about this time, I emailed my middle brother requesting a settlement to enable me to rent somewhere. And I was advised by my brother that it was better to communicate with him rather than with my parents. So even in those settlement, even in those discussions, I wasn't allowed to talk to my parents at all about it. So after some negotiation over about six weeks, we agreed on a settlement amount that was about 5,000 pounds less than what I'd originally asked for. So their reasoning for that, I actually asked for 12,500 pounds to be able to, because I was thinking of settling in London at that point and there's probably those, rents in London are absolutely extortionate.

But their reasoning they gave me, actually gave me [seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3714s) and a half thousand pounds in the end because basically what happened was when my granny Eames died, that's my mum's stepmother, she left each of us boys 7,500 pounds. So that's what they sort of like, that's what their reasoning was because I'd spent all my 7,500 pounds that she gave me. So they said, right, we'll give you 7,500 pounds because that's what your brother's got from your gran.

And this settlement actually came from my family and I was actually got really annoyed about this. It didn't come from the Brethren. And I raised this with the leading brother at that time. I said, basically, I said, look, at the end of the day, you're getting my family to give me this settlement, but it's not my family that's withdrawn from me, it's the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3770s) that withdrew from me. So therefore, it should be the Brethren that are giving the money, not my family.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3779s)

And his response?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3780s)

And his response was, oh, do you want me and, I won't say the name, do you want me and another person to come around and see you? That's all I got in response, which had absolutely nothing to do with what I told him at all. Yeah. So all this time I was attending AA and other 12-step fellowships and was basically sharing about what was going on. And I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason.

So after one of the 12-step meetings, one of the members came up to me and said, I've been listening to your shares in the meetings over the last few weeks and I want you to know that I have a spare room you can use. You can have it free of charge for as long as you need until you get on your feet and find somewhere. Now the Brethren tell you that everybody in the world is wicked and they just, you know, if they do something for you, they want something out of it. But he did that free of charge for as long as he wanted, unconditionally. [unconditionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3847s) yeah, absolutely.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3849s)

And there's so many people like that.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3852s)

Yeah, yeah, there are, there are. So I was so grateful for this. A week later, I moved out of the parents' house. Obviously, they weren't at home when I left because obviously they were living up in Liverpool. So I got the train to London to stay with this friend. So I've never, ever said goodbye to my mother. Never. I just, I haven't been given a chance.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3891s)

And have you seen your mother since?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3896s)

Yeah, just before COVID, I went to see her. And I actually timed it wrong because there was another sister there. It was actually the sister that I had to stay with when I returned to Swaffham. It was her. So it was about the worst person that could have been around there. Anyway, yeah, I went to the door and my mum answered. And I had a bit of a conversation with my mum with this other person listening in. And in the end, I had to say to her, look, can you go? Because I need to speak to my mum in private.

And give my mum her due, she said, so and so, look, can you go into another room please? And I did sort of say goodbye to her then, but I've never said goodbye properly. Yeah, so you know, it hurts, it really hurts. Oh, it's, I'm still, you know, I miss her every day.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=3973s)

And I think we can actually, you don't even need to say it, Ross, we can see it in your face. You know, I know because I know you that you're very fond of your mother, but it's like when Anne talks about her children or you know, and you can see it in your face and the saddest thing of it all, it is so unnecessary. It's, there is no, to most people, to us, the separation that causes these deep wounds is unnecessary. It is.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4002s)

I mean, it feels like a part of me has been ripped out. Yeah. I just can't. You know, obviously, I've got a wonderful partner. You can probably see him in the picture behind. Yeah. You know, and his parents treat me like their own child.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4017s)

Yeah. And that was one thing I wanted also to focus on. I know you've met your partner and you're very happy, but I thought it would be nice if you could share how his family, your partner's family, have treated you. Because it's been wonderful. It's been really good, hasn't it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4033s)

Yeah, since day one, they've taken me into their arms. I mean, my partner's mum literally refers to me as her son. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4045s)

No, I'm so fortunate. I'm really blessed. Yeah. And whilst it's no substitute, it sure helps, doesn't it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4053s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, when I did leave, after I'd left and I was staying in London, I asked for a photo of my brothers and their families and one of dad and mum, but I was basically told they'd rather I didn't have one. So I stayed with a chap in London from July until October. And then in October 2014, I ended up moving back to Peterborough because obviously it's where I was born and brought up, so new area. And that's where I've been ever since, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4088s)

Yeah, yeah. And you're still there and you've got your own place. Yeah. And you've got your partner. Yeah. So thinking about it, Ross, we know that there are gay people in the Brethren. In fact, I know that the Get A Life podcasts have been contacted since Ben's podcast by people in the Brethren currently who are gay. What would you say to somebody in the Brethren who's gay? From what you've learned.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4120s)

What I've learned. The first thing I would say is, if you're not thinking of leaving straight away, do not get married. Whatever you do, don't get married. That is one thing to say. And the other thing I would say is there is an enormous LGBT community out here. And for instance, my partner and I are part of a local LGBT meetup group in Peterborough and there's in the group there are about 700 and odd members.

So you will find there are a lot of people out here that, you know, that are just like you and they will take you into their arms and they are very excited because they've, because even out here, they've had to go through so much to get to where you are now. They are very accepting of people and they will accept you and there's nothing to be frightened of.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4192s)

Yeah. And I think that's quite important, isn't it? Because there's two factors coming in here. There's the fact that you're gay, but then also the fact you're in a very closed totalitarian community. So there's two factors there. And I imagine the feeling that you must be the only gay person in the world can be quite strong. And to realise that actually you're not and that there's plenty of people who get you. But those people, regardless of not having been in the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4223s), have probably had to fight for things a little bit more.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4226s)

Yeah, and for that reason, they are very accepting of people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4229s)

Yes.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4230s)

You know, statistics wise, one in ten people are gay. So there must be Brethren in there. Yeah, yeah, there will be. Would it be fair to say, Ross, to anyone who's still in there, because I know obviously, it's, you know, there's such a homophobic bunch, would it be fair to point out, because obviously they'll have been told that it's not, but it's fair to point out that it is completely normal?

Yeah, yeah. I mean, if I can just refer to one paragraph that I wrote to my dad and mum, I've said;

 "Returning to the Brethren is not an option for me. Whether you choose to accept it, the fact is I am gay. I would have done anything not to have been born this way, but it is God who [made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4279s) me like this. It is not something I've chosen."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4281s)

And I'll also add to that, because I've got the same letter, Ross had written, "I AM GAY" in capitals, with some pride, eh Ross? Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4294s)

You know, it does, it does leave its mark. I know that's actually another thing I would say to anybody in there that's going, get out as young as you can. Yeah, because the longer it's indoctrinated into you, I mean, most of the time I hate myself for who I am because of the indoctrination I've had over the years, for 36 years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4321s)

Yeah, it must take a long time to unravel that indoctrination of 'the way you are is wicked and shouldn't happen' kind of thing. Yeah, that must be tough. Yeah. Well Ross, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your story. I've known you a few years and I know that it cost you a lot to speak out about it. And I really do commend you and say thank you for doing that because I firmly believe having these stories out there will [help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4351s) people. And I think you're right, the fact that you're speaking as somebody who had to endure a lot as a gay person in the Brethren will resonate with people in there for sure.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4362s)

Yeah. And another thing I'd like to just add quickly is that I know that my mum can see that it's all wrong in there because her father had a holiday home over in the Isle of Man in the late 1950s, early 60s. Yes. And for the last two or three years I was in the Brethren, she was forever saying, oh, I wish it was the good old days in the Isle of Man. I wish it was the good old days.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4394s) following on from that, her brother stayed in the Isle of Man and he left in 1970\. And about four or five years ago, I connected with my cousins over there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4409s)

Oh, lovely.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4411s)

Last year, my partner and I went to see them for the first time for just over a week and we're going again this year for a couple of weeks. And they said, that's nice, like that, no question.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4422s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4423s)

Yeah, that's another thing that, you know, that's another thing the Brethren do, they rip away because my mum's brother decided to leave, she's never seen any of her nieces and nephews, no, and great nieces and great nephews. And also the other thing I would say is that towards the end of his life, my uncle had cancer and he was in hospital in Liverpool over here. And my mum actually wanted to go and see him. So she obviously [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4453s) to the local priests at that time and said, look, I want to go and see my brother in Liverpool. And they obviously spoke to the bigwigs up in Liverpool and they said, no, ain't gonna happen, basically. And I know my mum forever regretted the decision that she didn't, you know, that she wishes that she hadn't told anybody and just gone anyway.

Yeah, that she hadn't asked permission almost. I now know, my cousins told me when I was over there, they said [basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4483s) their dad, my uncle, never got over the loss of his sister. He never ever got over it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4494s)

Yeah. And that's what we're hearing more and more, isn't there? Years and years of families destroyed where families don't want to be.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4501s)

Yeah, yeah. Because it's not, it's not just the ones that have left either.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4505s)

No.

### [**Anne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4507s)

Yeah, it's everybody. It is all that heartache. The ones inside, the ones outside. Yeah. It's just so frustrating in such a way.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4521s)

Well, it's just got to stop. It's got to stop. That's it. They can have their Christian faith, they can have their beliefs. I mean, I'm quite, you know, they told, they said quite explicitly in writing that their separation is moral, not physical. Yeah, I believe in moral separation from evil. I'm afraid I agree with them, but they don't practice that, do they? They don't know that it's physical. You cannot [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4551s), you cannot talk to.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4552s)

Yeah, no. And I'd just like to add, you know, if there's anything I can help do to help, count me in, basically.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4562s)

You're very welcome. Very welcome. Yeah. Okay, Ross, really, we truly appreciate you speaking out because I do know it's cost you a lot and it's a very brave thing to do, very brave.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4574s)

Being a bit analytical, but that is just how I'm coping with things.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4580s)

It's your story, you tell it how you want.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4581s)

Well done, Ross.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qeft44uSo24&t=4583s)

Thank you, Ross. Thank you, Ross. To share your story or be a guest on the show, email info.getalife at proton.me.

*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
