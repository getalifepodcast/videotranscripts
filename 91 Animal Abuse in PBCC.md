## Summary

TRIGGER WARNING- Discussion and videos on animal abuse.
One of the strangest and saddest features of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is its appalling record of cruelty to animals. From slaughterhouses where live pigs are dropped to boiling water, to using SUVs to ram and run over kangaroos, to the mindless torture of cats, chickens and small wild birds and animals - the PBCC does it all - and apparently takes great pleasure in it.
It all started with a great slaughter of pets in the 1960s, when James Taylor Jr, the alcoholic leader of the cult decreed that animals were "unclean" and were used by Satan to take our affections away from God. Within days of this pronouncement, tens of thousands of cats, dogs, rabbits, birds and other creatures were drowned, beaten to death or if lucky, euthanized.
Hear accounts from PBCC leavers who were traumatized as children by this callous genocide of pets.
Then it get worse...
Hear One School Global teachers describe how their students delighted in cruelty to animals, and how they had to bring in speakers from animal cruelty charities to try and help them. Hear how the prominent and extremely wealthy Bruce Hazell tormented birds and rabbits in PBCC priest Oliver Woodcock's backyard. We hear how young brethren attending Bible readings, and actually staying in the house with Global PBCC leader Bruce D Hales would spend the time between church meetings "Roo bashing" including running over and fatally wounding mother kangaroos with joeys in their pouches.
Finally, in a filthy mélange of religious hypocrisy, homophobia, political corruption and cruelty to animals, the story of the execrable Roger Unwin's Tasmanian pig farm.
We end this podcast on a light note with funny videos and pictures of ex-members sharing their beautiful moments with their pets.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=59s)

Stay tuned at the end of the podcast for pictures and funny videos of ex-members enjoying their beautiful relationship with their pets, which is banned within the PBCC.

Hey everyone, welcome back to Get a Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today to discuss some really heart-wrenching stories regarding animal abuse. So we're really telling everyone, viewer discretion is advised. We're going to give you warning before we play any videos that have disturbing images.

And I mean, myself, I have a hard time watching them. So feel free to just jump past them and move on with the podcast.

I have to say that in all the research that I have done preparing for this podcast, we're going to go through some of the psychological links between animal abuse that we are going to hear about and the podcast that we just witnessed with Mick Dover. So there's a lot of correlation and links between humans that really abuse animals.

[People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=133s) who are abusing animals are likely to abuse humans, and so we're going to talk a little bit about that today. I'm going to open it up to you, Richard and Ben, and what have you guys come across within the PBCC with animal abuse?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=147s)

Well, I've got a few stories which are horrific. Australians are kind of fairly well known for their roo-bashing and I remember a time when I was at Condobolin for a fellowship meeting. We had Bruce Hales in the house for dinner Thursday night, and Friday night we were all in the cars, you know, out bashing roos. It was the most horrific thing [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=177s) have ever experienced in my life, one of the most.

I didn't know what it was, and obviously I understood the term. You know, you're 15, 16 years old, you're not going to stay home. You just wouldn't, you know, you'd be ostracized and bullied, and as we all know, I did everything to escape that. So you hop in the car and at first it seems like you're just going, you know, they're taking the overseas visitors for a bit of a drive around outback Australia, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=208s) they call outback Australia, you know, in the dark or at dusk.

And then they turn into a field and just hunt down roos and chase them with their bull bars and run them over or bash them, literally. I just remember this poor roo with its baby in the pouch just screeching, and it was just, I can still hear a noise. It was just so horrific.

[Growing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=238s) up, I grew up in a town where there was a family of five boys that were notoriously cruel and ruthless. I remember one experience staying there, well actually a few experiences, where they used to catch birds and try and, instead of clipping their wings like a professional does to stop a bird from flying, like say you get a tame budgie or something, you would [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=268s) like the last two feathers, which, you know, it's like cutting hair, it doesn't hurt. They would literally cut off their whole wing.

And I just remember thinking and seeing this and just like, I nearly threw up. These poor bird wings just had these stumps of blood and the screeches of pain.

Another time they caught a kitten and put it on, you know, we have like 40-degree heat here in summer, put it on the back of their dad's ute on the metal and just watched and laughed as it ran around screaming as its little paws burnt.

And then another time they had a rabbit and they had like a metal cage it was in, like a square sort of a rectangle cage, and then it had like a sort of covered part that was all metal. They would get the rabbit to go back in there and block it off and then throw a really loud bunger in there. This poor rabbit just went absolutely crazy because of the noise and the [sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=341s) that they, and to the point where obviously its heart beat out and there was just a dead rabbit in there.

It was just, they were cruel unnecessarily for entertainment. And it really was a projection of the family that they were living in. You know, they were a cruel bunch of people. They were constant bullies in my life, like cruel. And, you know, I'm talking to the point where they would try and break your neck. It was horrific. They are just absolutely horrific, have absolute no regard for, you know, what you want to call God's creatures, let alone other humans.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=383s)

It's just heart-wrenching, heart-wrenching. Of course, we put a plea out on social media for people to submit their stories or choose to come on here and tell them. I mean, we had an outpouring amount of stories that came in. I'm going to go through some of them, I'm going to go through all of them, but I'm going to go through some of them. And we have a couple guests that are going to come on and talk about what they experienced too.

For myself growing up, I had a daughter who was an absolute avid animal rescuer. And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=413s) at some point in times in our life, right, she had over 20 rescued birds and hedgehogs and bearded dragons and geckos. And I mean, the nurturing of animals creates such a heartfelt person, right?

So you can see how we've done how many podcasts, 89 podcasts, 90 podcasts about the abuse we've all endured. So these stories that landed on my lap [weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=443s) shocking, yet they still were very horrific to hear. Yeah, it's just heart-wrenching, absolutely heart-wrenching. Please welcome to the podcast, Mark Ghinn. Hello Mark, how are you?

I'm good, thank you. How are you? Good. I'll introduce you to Richard and Ben, who is from Australia.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=466s)

Hi.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=467s)

This is Mark from the UK and he is going to tell us a story that he witnessed in his teenage years. So go ahead Mark, what was it that you had witnessed?

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=479s)

Yeah, I witnessed a young brother, probably a couple of years my senior, killing a rabbit. They kept rabbits, and I presumed it's for eating, I'm not really sure. But yeah, he killed this rabbit, I don't think very humanely in my opinion. He first tried to break its neck by pulling the body and sort of pulling the neck.

[It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=510s) didn't work, the rabbit was still moving. He then swung it against the side of the shed a few times and it was still moving. And the blood coming out the rabbit's eyes, yeah, it's not a pretty sight. It wasn't very quick. I think I thought it was about sort of five to ten minutes before the rabbit finally gave up the ghost, but in reality, it's probably a bit less than that. But it wasn't very quick.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=537s)

Wow. And this person that you witnessed is quite high up in the PBCC today. Are you willing to share his name?

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=546s)

I'm not willing to share Bruce Hazel's name, no.

Yeah, and the venue was actually Oliver Woodcock's garden. He was also quite high up in my day, yes. Yeah, quite a known chap. Not my best mate, but a fairly known chap, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=568s)

I knew these people personally, very well. Well, particularly Oliver Woodcock, I knew very well. But Bruce Hazel is very, very high up, probably quite possibly the top person in the UK hierarchy, particularly in connection with anything financial.

And in fact, it's just been uncovered by Damien Hastie that at the height of the charity commission crisis, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=599s) the Brethren were seeking to get restore the charitable status of their meeting halls, Bruce Hazel made a very large donation to the Conservative Party coffers through a limited company, which apparently didn't actually exist until a few years later. So you can figure that one out for yourself.

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=623s)

Well, I won't say what I'm thinking, but I know Bruce fairly well because the nearest neighbours we had as brethren were the Hazel family. So Bruce was, I think, maybe two years my senior, but I had a lot to do with Bruce in my younger years. So I know the family quite well.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=643s)

So one would also speculate you got amazing tax relief from that donation too, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=651s)

Well, the speculation would be more that generous donations to the Conservative Party might ease the charitable status of the Brethren meeting halls, not to mention subsequent PPE contracts. I mean, Bruce Hazel has and has had for a long time one of the largest brethren's businesses in the UK and consortiums of businesses.

Garth Christie, who was perhaps more prominent in terms of spiritual matters, you might say, in the UK under Bruce Hales, runs a business called Hazel 4D, which is connected, of course, to the Hazel family. So as usual, you've got this clique of top businessmen who are all financially interrelated and who are kind of running the UK brethren as their family business.

And we [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=712s) be hearing a lot more about Bruce Hazel in the next year, I'm quite certain, particularly as the PPE is investigated. But, you might say, well, that's irrelevant. But no, it's not, because what W.B. Hales, what he ministered is being ruthless in business. And he was withdrawn from for that.

And now Bruce Hales has come back and restated that principle that the brethren [should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=742s) be ruthless in business. And the word ruthless means without compassion or consideration for the suffering of others. And so whether it comes down to how you conduct your business or how you kill a rabbit, it's the same thing. It's a ruthless lack of empathy.

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=762s)

Yeah, I agree. I think the purpose of me getting in touch was to try and reply to whether the brethren, as a whole, are cruel to animals. I'm not so sure. I don't remember hardly any interactions with animals at all in the brethren, like almost none. The rabbit incident was kind of almost unique.

So I can't put any connection between the brethren and cruelty apart from this particular episode. But I can probably suggest it might be in Bruce Hazel's character, because there was one other event which I did witness maybe a year or two [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=805s) where I think he kept a pet crow.

Well, there's a crow in the garden that couldn't fly over the fence. And I was around in the garden at one point in time and he said, "Oh, the crow needs to have his wings clipped." And the wings were really short stubby things, it couldn't fly. And he got some scissors and he hacked quite a lot of length of the wing and there's white pus coming out of the wing.

And I thought, "No, that's, you can trim the wings, maybe the tips," but he was [cutting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=835s) them really close to the roots. Wow. I just, I don't know. It may be more, I don't want to say too much about him because he's not here to defend himself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=845s)

He's welcome to come on and defend himself. We can invite every PBCC member.

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=849s)

If he gets an invitation, then yes. I felt both episodes that I witnessed were quite cruel. Yeah. That's my feeling.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=858s)

Well, of course, what you say about no interactions with animals, that was thanks to JT Jr.'s great slaughter of the pets. And, I mean, I guess you're talking about maybe the late 70s, are you? That kind of timescale?

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=876s)

Yes, I was. The rabbit incident was when Bruce was living with Oliver, which would have been late 70s, probably 79-ish, give or take a year, not entirely sure. The crow episode was probably a year, maybe a bit more, before that when Bruce was living with another family.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=898s)

Because as far as I understand, JT Jr. suddenly produced this sort of papal bull, if you like, and everyone had to dispose of all their pets. And apparently it wasn't even good enough to give them away, you actually had to have them put down or kill them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=920s)

For anyone listening, JT Jr. is the leader at the time who came up with the new rule that, you know, pets were no longer allowed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=929s)

Yeah, thank you. I mean, he was the guy who really radicalized, cultified, if you like, the brethren. But he died in 1970, and then after that, animals kind of crept back in. But there was this kind of idea, well, it's okay to keep an animal if you're going to eat it, if you're going to use it for food. And so there were a number of brethren who kept sort of rabbits or chickens.

And you know, they kind of, it was a get-around so they could keep an animal, but they had to actually eat it or eat the eggs or use it. But the whole one effect of JT Jr.'s dictate was that animals were regarded as somehow dirty or unclean, particularly dogs.

I think one of his sayings was you couldn't hold the Lord's Supper or communion, as you call it, in your house if you had a dog because dogs are unclean. And so animals were kind of demonized, and that kind of mentality got passed down the generations. You know, children were brought up without [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=995s) pets or animals around, or if they did have an animal outside, well, it was going to be killed for food. And you know, this is like now generations ago, and you've got generations that have grown up without the kind of humanizing effect of caring for a pet or regarding an animal as a feeling, living creature.

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFgyBZQ5ENOU%26t%3D1019s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1023s)

Well, we appreciate you coming on, Mark, and giving us a brief overview of what you witnessed. And yeah, thank you so much.

### [**Mark Ghinn**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1031s)

Yeah, thank you. You're so welcome. Thank you. Okay, anytime.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1036s)

Take care, Mark. Thanks, bye.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1037s)

See you, bye.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1043s)

I wanted to start off with going through an article that a lot of ex-members are aware of. And it was an article about a person inside the PBCC who shot a cat with an arrow. So just for our listeners, I'll read just a brief outline of this.

“A man arrested as part of a police investigation into an animal cruelty incident in which a cat was shot in the head with an arrow has admitted possessing prohibited weapons. Oliver Selby pleaded [guilty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1074s) to having three crossbows. They were seized at his Mount Barker home last month.”

And this is the picture of the cat with the arrow in him. 

“Police said inquiries continue into an incident where a cat in Mount Barker was shot in the head with an arrow. Selby refused to comment as he made a quick exit from court.”

And just some other stuff, this article doesn't have everything on it. I want to convey to the listeners what exactly these arrows and crossbows were. 

“Despite hiding three illegal crossbows and 20 bolts in his bedroom, he escaped conviction in the Mount Barker magistrate courts for a crime described [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1109s) serious. Mr. Selby faced a maximum fine of $20,000 or a two-year jail term.

The court heard the christian, understood to be a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church chapter member, worked as a salesman for his father's air compression system company. Police have said it was part of an animal cruelty investigation. That investigation remains ongoing as the police await crucial DNA tests for a crime that RSPCA described as sickening.

During sentencing submissions on Wednesday for the weapons charge, the court heard two powerful crossbows were found in a container and a pistol crossbow under a top bunk bed. While he has a hunting license, he did not have permission for the weapons or the three bolt packets.

While declining to convict him, he said, "I think you need to leave this court with a very strong reminder you should not indulge in breaking the law. If you are stupid enough to do it again, undoubtedly you'll be convicted and it will be your own fault."

Max the cat was recovering but was not the same, while their medical bills and their costs has topped $5,000. "I would have much preferred him to receive a conviction, but we live with it and we have to roll with it," that was the owner of the cat saying that.”

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1176s)

Wow. And of course, we have another case of a brethren committing a crime and getting away with a slap on the back of the wrist with a wet noodle.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1185s)

While the cat, of course, suffers horribly and the cat's owner is left with a $5,000 medical bill, and the guy who did the damage doesn't even have to pay that for them. But for people who are listening to this rather than watching, the pictures show a black and white cat with a crossbow bolt stuck in its head. It's right in the cat's nose, right below its eyes.

You wouldn't have thought the cat could [possibly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1216s) be alive. It's literally got a crossbow bolt just wedged there right in the front of its head with the feathers sticking out forward. And the guy had just been randomly shooting other people's pets from his bedroom window as far as the account goes. You know, this is...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1239s)

What can you say?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1240s)

It's just sick.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1243s)

Yeah, it reminds me of a group of boys that were from Gosford, I think it's now rebranded as Lisarow, where they used to take live chickens in Eskys to the Australian Reptile Park and let them go in the crocodile enclosure so they could watch these crocodiles scramble and fight for these poor chooks, obviously, that can't fly.

And, yeah, they would literally do it for fun and they would take overseas visitors there and would be like, "Hey, we've got an esky full of chickens for the crocodiles," like live chickens. And I think they got banned from the park, actually, from memory. Yeah, they did. Because, yeah, it didn't happen just once. Like it was a story that we all used to know of. And they were notorious for doing ridiculously harmful things to society, like crazy [things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1301s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1301s)

You know, I spoke to an avid hunter yesterday and I'm going to read out what we discussed. He said like, hunters don't even hurt animals like they aim to hit the lungs or the heart so that they die in five to ten seconds, and even 10 seconds is too long. So it's called an ethical shot. They don't want an animal to even suffer.

If you shoot an animal and it runs away, provisions are made for you to [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1331s) and track down that animal, whatever it takes to be able to put that animal out of its misery. And this is what he said, "A real hunter never takes pleasure in hurting an animal. They want it to die instantly."

So for those people who are going to come back at us and be like, "Well, you know, what about hunters?" Yeah, that's why I went and did my due diligence and talked to someone I know that is an avid hunter. And like, no, there's no, when I told them about these stories, no, those are animal cruelty stories. A hunter does not do [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1362s)

I want to go through some of the stories that landed on my lap and lead up to why we decided to do this podcast. So stay with us while we go through these, because what we're about to show you with what landed on our lap is horrific, but also helps you understand how these people think.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1381s)

Yeah, just before you go on, can I just say, like in that hunting question, I mean, I know in Australia kangaroos, the numbers get too large and they have to be culled, but they can be culled humanely by shooting them with a rifle professionally. Driving through a field and bouncing them off the front of your vehicle so they die of internal injuries or broken limbs and ribs is not hunting. It's a pathetic, [cowardly,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1412s) cruel form of, it's not even a sport. I mean, it's like masculinity, how sick.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1420s)

And the thing is, some of them take weeks to die. Like some of them don't just die overnight, some of them are left there dying for weeks. And some of them have babies that inside of them, they are marsupials. They have live babies within them that, you know, are sitting there waiting for their, you know, while crying while their mother's dead.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1438s)

Yeah. I mean, there's a difference between, you know, keeping numbers down on certain species of animals and animal abuse for sport and fun and to watch.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1448s)

Right. I mean, the roo-bashing, I mean, I was in England, you know, I was raised in England and there would be brethren would take trips to Australia. So probably every congregation, maybe one or more person would get to go to Australia every year to visit the Brethren there and listen to Bruce Hales.

They would all come back with these horrific stories of roo-bashing. This wasn't just a one-off incident, Ben. This was the thing. It was part of the tour. You see the Sydney Harbour Bridge and you see this and that, and you go running over kangaroos.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1490s)

And that's literally what it was. You went out west, and the further out you went, the more roos there were, and the more chances are you went roo-bashing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1499s)

And, I mean, you say Bruce Hales was in the house while this was proceeding. So, I mean, he had obviously been aware of what was going on.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFgyBZQ5ENOU%26t%3D1505s)

Oh, of course. His own boys have probably done it. Like, it's... yeah. It was, you were chucked in the back of a car or on the back of a ute and you clang onto it for dear life while you chase these creatures over valleys and hills, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1522s)

So I'm going to read some of these stories, and I'm using names when I was given names. So some of them are anonymous, which is fine. This is from an anonymous sender, that Roger Arnott's boys used to catch squirrels and cats and spray paint them.

I had an insider reach out to me about how she was allergic to meat and completely gets made fun of for being vegan. She says it's one thing that she has to deal with all the time.

So Beverly Richardson brought forth a story, and so I'm just going to read what she said to me. "My parents and grandmother who lived with us were out when the 'no pets' rule came in. My grandmother had a pet budgie named Pell which talked and she loved that bird. When she was restored, she had a very long priestly and a priest walked out after [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1569s) 90 minutes with the bird in the cage. She would have known he was either going to let it out or kill it. She was a bedridden old lady with heart failure. She died not long after."

"My pup I had, which I know was against their rules, but someone gave it to me after my father died. Two years later, when I ran from home, I couldn't take my pup with me. If only I had. I knew mom loved that dog as much as me and with her a widow with no other children, I felt it would be company for her. I believe she was made, encouraged to have the pup euthanized. [No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1599s) doubt they used the fact I had this pup as a reason for me running away. It still haunts me. A two-year-old healthy dog deserved more. My dad was a country boy and early in life we had pets and I was taught to love animals. They were God's creation. I always think how people treat animals gives a good judgment of their character."

Another anonymous story. "My mother, who was completely brainwashed, took our lovely little whippet to the vet to be put down in 1963, 1964, or whenever that awful rule came in. I had just started work and remembered being so upset and crying. My brother and I were only talking about it this week. That makes me ashamed that someone could do such a thing and makes me feel sick in my stomach when I think about it still. How dreadful it was."

Another anonymous post. "Just saw your post about animal cruelty and immediately thought of our Mexican fiesta fun day that we did where we brought three llamas and had grown adults chase them around a very small enclosure. They were brought solely in for that purpose. I recall one person hitting one with a stick quite vigorously. Also heard a story one of my uncle shoving a plunger up a goat's backside."

So on one of the posts on Facebook when we were asking for people to come forward, I noticed Mark Elliot had posted. "We once lived next door to [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1671s) OneSchool Global teachers. They told us children were so cruel to hamsters, rabbits, etc., trying to poke their eyes out with pencils, etc. That they organized a visit from the SPCA to try and teach pupils to treat them more kindly." And I actually have an article pulled up and I'm going to refer to in a bit.

Another anonymous post. This one's quite lengthy, but it's got a lot of horrific stuff that happened in it. "My family had a dog named Chippy. My sister and the older kids also had a house full of pets. Rabbits that my dad had made a pen for in the basement of where I grew up. Rats, guinea pigs, mice, hamsters, a cat, budgie, snake, fish, etc. When the ruling came in that we could no longer have pets, my dad had to get Chippy put down at the vet and he wasn't old. They weren't allowed to re-home the pets as that was considered taking part in committing evil."

"The leading brothers came and killed the other animals. They did it right there at the home. That traumatized the older kids as they watched in horror as their pets were destroyed. I remember [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1727s) fish getting flushed down the toilet. I remember a cat getting drowned in the kitchen sink. I was little. The teaching that animals were evil and to be treated with disrespect and coldness, that still sickens me to today."

"When I was young, around the grade one age, we had a family of squirrels living in an attic space in our home. I watched as one of the leading brothers of our locality came and took each one of the babies out of our attic space and with exclamations of great joy broke their necks in front of me, right in one of the bedrooms where the attic access was, dropping [each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1757s) of the dead babies into a paper bag to be disposed of. This was after he had taken great satisfaction and causing them pain by yanking on their limbs and tails. My mom wanted them to just be outside so they'd live, but I remember how this brother reminded my mom that animals were all created evil as they take our time and affection away from God. I remember my mom throwing up after this experience. She loved all animals."

"A second instance I clearly remember was when we were visiting the Bryan's house in London, Ontario. Our family was good friends with the [Bryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1788s) family. Again, I was young. A cat had a litter of kittens under their porch. When I discovered them, I was overjoyed and I was enjoying cuddling them as I loved animals. But Mr. Bryan was horrified that such evil was on his property. He took them and with one of his tools that he used for car repairs, he made sure they were dead. I don't know if I should share the gruesome details. He then asked us to get the hose so we could wash away the blood and stuff. That made me sick. I hated visiting there after that. Seeing kitten's head smashed in as a young kid is extremely [traumatizing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1818s)"

"To be told that animals are evil because they take our time and affection away from the Lord is wrong. To be taught to be cruel and heartless to them and torment precious creatures that God created is very wrong. I've taken this verse from the King James Version, Proverbs 12, verse 10: 'A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.' In the New Living Translation, it says it this way, 'The godly care for their animals, but the wicked are always cruel.' This is something that I took issue with as a teen, after witnessing a young man kick a little dog that was running around in a field that was next to the meeting room at the time. It was not on a leash and just wanted to have fun. It was from one of the neighboring houses. He kicked it away from him in fun."

And our next guest who has a story is [Lara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1865s) Payne, and we're just gonna bring her in so she can tell her story.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1869s)

Hello, hello. How are you? Hey Richard, hey Ben, hey Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1875s)

All good. How are you? You had a story about some animal cruelty that you witnessed. You want to share with us? It's a scary story.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1885s)

That's okay. As soon as you posted that on Facebook, I was like, "Oh my goodness." It just made me stop and think about how the brethren had no regard for animals. Like, they didn't even deserve to just live or be. I mean, things, I'll start with like simple things, like the boys used to pull the bugs' feet or legs off or their wings [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1915s) so then they couldn't live. Like they thought that was funny, and now in hindsight, I'm like, that's really morbid.

And then the worst is, I texted Cheryl right away. I was like, they killed a possum in our garbage can. I have to tell you how that came about. So I think somebody went to take some trash out and there was a possum in the trash can, because that's what they do. Instead of just tipping [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1945s) trash can over and letting the possum go, for some reason they decided that it needed to die.

And if I remember right, it was one of the brethren neighbor people down the street that came down and helped eliminate this possum for being a possum. That's it. I remember it so much so that [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=1975s) still kind of horrified when I see possums. Like, we have some in our backyard and I'm just like, oh, I think it's just the memory of them. It's not that they're bad. And we would have some little ones and my husband and my daughter held them and we took these cute pictures and I'm like, I just can't get past it.

It just reminds me of that time. And oh, it's bad. It's just funny how little things like that give you such bad memories. So the possum was in the garbage can trying to get out and they decided that they were going to drown it. So they stuck another garbage can on top, like into the can so the possum is down in there, and then started [filling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2036s) it with water so that it couldn't come out.

And it was like, I just remember it being like this lengthy process. And they were like, "Well, we don't want to put too much water because we don't want it to be able to rise up and get out." I just, I don't know. I just remember the whole thing was just like, oh, it's just sad. Like, you know, this can is moving and the possum's trying to get out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2066s) it can't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2068s)

It's horrific.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2069s)

It's just like, why? Why did the possum have to die?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2078s)

But where's the empathy? I mean, if I witness something like that, I immediately think, what would it be like to be drowned? What would it be like if I was trapped underwater? Why don't people think like that?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2094s)

Yeah, no one's trying to save you. No one's trying to help you. Like, I don't know. And why? Like, and then after the possum was dead, like I was so traumatized by it. Me and my next brother down, we wanted to have a burial for this poor possum's untimely death. So we had a burial in the back alleyway for the possum. We dug a hole and poured them into it. And I just to this day, I think back about that and I'm like, why was it funny or why did animals need to be eliminated? Why was there no love allowed to be shown to animals of any kind? Like what does it actually do to you as a person when you have no love for things?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2152s)

You know, often the case, isn't it, that it's a projection of not being able to control your surroundings. You're being, you know, seen or you're maybe part of a family that's just as abusive. In the case of the story that I told, I was thinking about those boys. You know, they're a part, it's a very similar environment for them. And so for them to gain control over, you know, what little control they have in their environment is to inflict pain and suffering on those [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2182s) they could control, and be that other kids they bullied or the animals that they came in contact with.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2187s)

Yeah, I mean, I remember even like, you know how you learn about the a magnifying glass and if you shine the light right, you can burn a leaf or whatever, but they thought it would be funny to burn an ant. Like, why do you need to kill things?

And another one I remember, I was pretty young, and I just remember something about a kitten being tossed up really high in the air and like the poor thing was terrified. Like, I don't, they weren't catching it. You know, I don't know what the idea [was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2234s) I want to say something about like, I remember it being in the alleyway and a telephone pole, like wire. I don't know if they thought they were trying to like throw it up and see if it would be okay if it hit the wire or something.

I don't know what they were thinking about that one. But as soon as you posted that, I was just like, oh, I know of quite a few times that [animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2264s) were just like not respected at all. Like they just aren't even worthy of living because somehow they're less.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2278s)

We were just talking about JTJr., James Taylor Jr., and his edict that all the pets had to be killed. And the reason he gave was because, well, they'll take your affections away from Christ. But I think what he was worried about is that they would take the brethren's affections away from him. He was jealous of people's cats and dogs because he thought, well, you know, these people, they love their dog more than they love me.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2307s)

Share mine.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2308s)

Yeah, yeah. Oh, wonderful, perfect, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2311s)

And I mean, anybody who has pets knows what a lifesaver they are in hard times. And to me, animals teach you how to love. They teach us how to love. So for them to have this rule is completely absurd. It's actually the opposite. It actually makes you become an opposite person.

I mean, all these accounts that we're going through today, these are evil accounts, absolutely evil accounts that are happening. I wanted to get into the psychology part of this. And I came across this licensed psychologist. It's a forensic consultation. He's named Scott Johnson out of the USA. I want to read what this article said.

I will post [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2354s) article at the end of the podcast in the description, but I just want to draw some parallels here between the psychology of animal abuse and what we've all experienced within the PBCC.

“The mistreatment and abuse of animals is a significant indicator of violence towards humans, up to and including intimate partner abuse, sexual assault, rape, murder. All too often, mental health professionals and prosecutors miss the seriousness of any cruelty towards animals [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2384s) the significant role animal cruelty plays in the perpetuation of violent and non-violent criminal behavior. The literature supports that animal cruelty is one of the earliest markers for future acts of both violent and non-violent criminal behaviors.”

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2400s)

I've heard that before about they start with animals and then it's people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2408s)

Yeah. 

“Whether animal cruelty occurs prior to or subsequent to witnessing or experiencing any type of abuse is unknown. What is known is the connections between experiencing abuse, witnessing domestic abuse and animal cruelty. There have been consistent research findings to suggest a strong link between animal cruelty and violence towards people, including domestic abuse and child abuse.

Law enforcement is also aware of the connection between animal abuse and human violence. Animal abusers are [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2438s) likely to engage in criminal behavior and to be diagnosed having antisocial personality disorder. Those who engage in animal cruelty were three times more likely to commit other crimes including murder, rape, robbery, assault, harassment, threats and drug substance abuse. The major motivations for engaging in animal cruelty include anger, fun, control, fear, dislike, [revenge,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2469s) imitation and sexual pleasure.”

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2474s)

Yeah, all of those. I like the control, thinking it's funny. Like I just, you know, yeah. I mean, not having animals growing up in my life was traumatic enough. Jason and I kind of joke about it, but when I first met him, he had a cat and this cat didn't really like me. He always says it should have been my sign.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2504s) it took me a while. I actually considered whether or not I should break up with him because I didn't know if I wanted an animal. Like now, I love kitty cats. I think they're wonderful. We have three. But it's just so sad.

And just the level of how going to see animals, even like here in San Antonio, we have the [Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2534s) World, one of the sites for Sea World, and we weren't allowed to go because why?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2545s)

Because it's animals, yeah, yeah.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2547s)

I guess. I mean, we're allowed to go to the zoo, so why can't we go to the Sea World? I remember another couple down the street...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2555s)

Because it had the word "world" in it.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2559s)

No, they have roller coasters is what I think it was. It might be considered fun.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2566s)

I had a story come out of Indianapolis that had a young boy who tied cats by their tails to trees and tormented animals, absolutely tormented animals. He used to close chickens' beaks until they went cross-eyed and couldn't walk anymore and they would fall down.

And it's just, my whole point in drawing this psychological parallel is that when they allow and promote and let these kinds of things happen, people who have that kind of hatred and feeling in their [body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2608s), whether it's portrayed to an animal, it eventually is going to get portrayed to a human, right?

So I do think this is an absolute necessity in the PBCC to change their behaviors. They need to allow pets. These humans need to know how to interact with animals, how to treat animals, and maybe that will rub off on them and how they treat other humans.

We just recently had Carlin on TikTok go absolute viral. And you go and look in her comments and the amount of comments that are showing up in there about people who have worked for them. What was the worst time of their life? People who have a hard time getting over it. It's like comment after comment after comment about the abuse and how they were treated. And if they are allowed to treat animals like this, they are going to treat [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2662s) humans outside of their ecosystem like this. And that's not right. It is not okay.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2669s)

No, it's not. I mean, why? They're animals put in this world by God. Like, they have every right to be here, too.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2679s)

It actually reminds me of another story. And it does make me wonder if often this behavior is learned. Like you see other older kids doing it, then you know, you do it, either to gain a sense of fulfillment by fitting in or... yeah.

There was a, when, I don't know if it's globally, but in Australia when people used to get married, the young local boys would get the keys to the house and like do up the house full [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2709s) pranks and yeah, yeah, totally ruin the house the night before.

And I remember this one time where, you know, we heard weeks after of how they had got a cow and put it inside, you know, this person's place. But to get the cow back, they tied it like from its collar or whatever it was or rope around its neck to the back of a car and dragged it back until it was like on its knees, bleeding, being dragged up the road.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2739s) these kids that, you know, were being cruel to the kitten, burning the kitten, that were cutting off birds' wings, that were, you know, killing the rabbits were the same kids' families that were, you know, part of this. So like experiencing this as tiny kids. So I think that is definitely a learned behaviour.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2763s)

Yeah. You know, this takes us to the reason why we did this podcast. So we're going to introduce you to a story that's really hit the news lately in Tasmania. It's a slaughterhouse. I took this from an Instagram post. The very last slide has who it's from. So this is the man behind Scottsdale Pork that is in the limelight right now for his slaughterhouse.

This is Roger Unwin, the owner of Scottsdale Pork business and confirmed member of the Exclusive Brethren. 

“The Exclusive Brethren are a small but politically influential evangelical church that espouses separatist ideologies. In 2006, Roger Unwin was one of two members who authorized advertisements attacking the Tasmanian green policies on same-sex marriages and transgender rights.

Scottsdale Pork has repeatedly been favored by the Tasmanian government. In 2009, the state Labour Party granted the piggery nearly [$181,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2823s) as part of the expansion project. And in 2020, the Tasmanian Liberal government gave Scottsdale Pork a grant to construct a new abattoir in the state's northeast. The private facility at Scottsdale was built at a projected cost of $3 million, two-thirds of which came from the Tasmanian taxpayer.

In September 2023, we investigated the slaughterhouse and captured evidence of pigs being abused by workers and signs of consciousness after stunning attempts. The Scottsdale Pork brand promotes themselves as [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2853s) an ethical consumer choice. Scottsdale Pork, a pig slaughterhouse at the intersection of political corruption and bigotry.”

And this was on Instagram by, you can follow them, it's Dominion Movement. And there's an article that I will post also below the link.

The next video I'm going to introduce is the one with horrific imagery, so if you don't want to watch it, don't watch it. But it is a video of what went on when they went and investigated the slaughterhouse and what happened was [horrific.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=2887s) So here's the video of what they found. Content warning, the following video contains material that may be harmful or traumatizing to some audiences. Viewer discretion is advised. If you wish to skip this video, please go ahead to 53 minutes and 35 seconds.

\[Video content with animal abuse\]

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFgyBZQ5ENOU%26t%3D3221s)

A comment about pigs, they're also very intelligent and they experience fear. So someone told me at stock shows, are a big thing here in Texas, I think across the nation. People like have a cow or a rabbit or you know, things and they take them to the stock show and show them and [whatever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3245s)

When it's done, they sell them and generally speaking, they're sold and killed, right? And they said that the pigs will start screaming and it's just this blood-curdling thing that goes through the pig barn. And they said it's just the worst at the end of the stock show. I'm like, "Oh." Like, they know that. And yet [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3276s) think it's okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3278s)

Yeah. And I mean, obviously, if you watch that video, you would have heard a lot of that. So this is another picture of Roger Unwin in his facilities.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3288s)

Yeah. When I came across this picture, I thought, wow, he's wearing a mask to advertise his product. And then I realized, well, that's actually his face.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3304s)

So these, I mean, I can show some images from this article and then you guys can, I'll attach the links to these. So this is the article that was written January 11, 2024\. And again, these are disturbing images, so viewer discretion is advised. But this is the article that came forward.

Again, a lot of the, and you know, I think it's important, the amount of political gain that this slaughterhouse got. Like we know that so much of the abuse, whether it's animal abuse or gay abuse, the LGBTQ rights abuse, there's so much power behind some of these stories. And this is a prime example of how that happens.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3354s)

I mean, just to put it in context, in Tasmania, you've got the Labour Party, the Liberal Party and the Green Party. So Roger Unwin financed and another brother printed a whole load of leaflets, pamphlets, attacking the Green Party candidate. Particularly the allegations in these pamphlets were that the Green Party would promote LGBTQ rights and gay [rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3385s) and that this would break down the structure of society in Tasmania.

And they distributed these leaflets sort of quietly to try and pull down the Green candidate. And of course, the immediate beneficiaries were the Labour Party and the Liberal Party, of the two other candidates in the election. And so then having done this, then mysteriously Mr. Unwin gets $800,000 from one and [$2 million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3415s) from the other party that had benefited from his underhand, undercover leafleting campaign.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3422s)

So we have one other story of roo-bashing from Lane. And so here's his story.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3427s)

Hi, guys. So I've got a story of some animal abuse when I was in Australia in 2004\. So I was 14 years old and being a rebellious kid in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I got an encouragement trip, but my parents had to come with me and my older brother. So while we were there, we went to Tasmania. I don't remember the name of the town, but I think it [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3457s) with an H, maybe Hobart.

And the Brethren house we were at, I do not remember the guy's name, but in the evening they asked if we want to go out to a farm and do some roo hunting or something. I didn't really know what we were doing. We got in the station wagon and there was a couple, because it was like three-day meetings, a church gathering. So one of the nights it was after church and they [said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3488s) "Okay, let's go out."

And this couple was in the car, they were from the UK, a young newly married couple. And we started driving through the field with the high beams on, like across this field. And when you'd see these smaller kangaroos, I can't remember what they're called, but they're not the bigger ones, they're smaller ones, he would hit them with a car and then back up over them, which was shocking.

And the woman was crying. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3518s) woman from England was absolutely bawling her eyes out in the back. Then he pulls back onto the road, sees another one, hits it, then gets out and grabs it by the tail. It's like half dead and swings it by the tail around to kill it, hitting it onto the road. And when he did that, a baby fell out of its pouch and he stepped on it and killed it.

Like, I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3548s) know, I was pretty shocked as a kid. Like, I don't remember a ton after that. I was just like, holy shit. So it's very disturbing, very, very disturbing.

So that's just blatant animal abuse. And it's really sick that the PBCC doesn't allow pets as well, because pets teach us a lot, right? Especially dogs. Dogs teach us unconditional love. And I'm gonna get more into that. Just hold on. Dogs teach us unconditional love. Well, how do they do that? Well, a dog doesn't care what you look like, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3591s) fat you are, nothing. If you walk it, feed it, and just give it companionship, it will love you no matter what. That is unconditional love.

So of course a cult, especially, you know, a religious cult, doesn't want you to even experience that, right? It wants to give you a sky person, a sky daddy that's going to love you. And instead, this little guy will actually love you.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3620s)

I think it's so interesting how after I left the brethren, I found out about this correlation between, it starts with animal abuse and then it becomes, you know, sexual abuse or spousal abuse or even leading up to murder. Oftentimes there's this correlation between the two. And then I just think about my childhood and I'm like, yeah, animals were not even respected as worthy to [live.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3650s)

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3652s)

I mean, there's a famous documentary called "Don't Fuck With Cats," and it happened right here in Toronto. It's right in the neighborhood. There was some young guy who delighted in making videos of tormenting cats. I think he got hold of some kittens. He bought some kittens and put them in a plastic bag and attached a vacuum cleaner to it to suck all the air out.

And he videoed this whole thing and he posted it [online.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3682s) And there was a group of, I don't know what you call them, vigilantes or whatever, in Toronto who were trying to find this guy. I mean, they'd seen his stuff, but he was, you know, obviously not giving his location away. And they actually used to work and use all sorts of computer techniques to track him down. Whenever he made a new video, they'd try and find out where this guy was.

And they had the theory that if he started off [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3712s) cruelty to animals, eventually he was going to kill someone. And the tragedy was they kept on his trail, but before they had actually located him, he had moved to Montreal and he had somehow lured someone with a dating app or something into his apartment and drugged this guy and murdered him in the most, you know, bizarre and disgusting way. And, you know, they made a documentary about this, but it just was a graphic example of [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3748s) this leads to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3749s)

You know, and I guess that's why I started this podcast out in reference to the last podcast we did with Mick Dovers, right? Like, there's just the horrific accounts towards animals. You can now see how what happened to myself, what happened to Lara, what happened to Mick, right?

Like, I hope the PBCC can sit, and we know they watch every single podcast we do. So I just hope that you can genuinely sit with yourself and be able to see the correlation between these things and that this stuff is happening. There's so many people in there that are starting to open their eyes up and thinking, "Okay, maybe these people are actually on to something. Maybe these people are telling the truth."

Because we know how the narrative goes in there, right? I mean, the narratives that we get given are so opposite of what actually happened, of why we left, right? I mean, we've seen that time and time again. But [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3809s) just, I guess my plea from my heart is just to be able to correlate and be able to, when you're seeing a young boy or a young girl torture something, stop it. Stop and explain to them why we don't treat animals like that. At the same time, this is why we don't treat humans the way that you've been treating humans.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3831s)

I mean, if we look at the, if we look at the PBCC's website and their RRT website, their prominent slogan right across all of it is "living the Christian values of care and compassion." Maybe you need to start actually doing that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3850s)

Have some compassion. Yeah. So compassion should extend clear across the board, whether you believe that they have a soul or not. There should still be compassion shown because when you exude compassion to everything, those that are watching you then learn compassion and then they pass it down. So it's this chain reaction.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3872s)

It's a generational thing, isn't it? Very much so, yeah.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3877s)

And I was just thinking about like the core of Christianity, it's love. How is that love if you're killing things? It actually makes me remember, like, I don't know why I laugh, I guess it's like a nervous laugh. I remember a mouse and my dad killing it with a knife because it was in our house. And like, yeah, why couldn't we just catch the mouse and let the mouse go?

And I remember, like I was horrified, just the natural cycle of animals. A rat snake had gotten into a little bush and there was baby birds and [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3920s) baby birds started jumping out of the nest and they weren't ready to. And all this, and I told my husband, I was like, "But you can't kill the snake, just catch him." And he ended up catching him and like, one of the birds didn't make it. And I mean, I guess it's just part of life. You don't kill the snake.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3946s)

And even if you do have to kill them, then you make it, you make it fast, you make it quick. It doesn't need to be in front of children. It doesn't need to be horrific, right?

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3959s)

That whole thing about the possum, I just remember like, I had little brothers and sisters and I don't remember if those neighbors' kids were over, that were neighbors meaning brethren that were neighbors, because we all lived around each other all the time. It was this big ordeal and it took a lot of time. Like, why?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=3977s)

Yeah. I mean, it's just like what we were listening, I mean, the one account that we read out about squirrels upstairs that had gotten into and the horrific abuse of those and like kittens that were murdered. It's just, it doesn't need to happen. It doesn't need to be.

I remember when we had mice in our garage and my daughter caught them and she walked them down to the park a block down and let them loose in a park, right? But I mean, that's, she was an absolute [animal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4008s) rescuer on every level. But it's just, I guess the point we're trying to make is it's super important to, you know, like Richard said, when you have the slogan of, you know, "utmost compassion" and the hashtag "RRT cares" and you're doing all this stuff saying you've got this care and compassion, you actually need to walk your talk.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4027s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4028s)

Exactly. And then one last story from those of you that have read "Joy and Sorrow" from Joy Nason. And she was so kind to send us an audio of her excerpt in her book that she wrote on animal abuse. So here's that audio excerpt.

### [**Joy Nason**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4047s)

It is mortifying for me to recall my complicity in getting rid of our family cat who admittedly was in his declining years when the "No Pets" rule was introduced in the 1960s. This edict was a corker. Naturally, the Exclusive Brethren leadership had a line from J.N. Darby's edition of the Bible to back up the latest weird decree, "without are the dogs," Revelation 22, [verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4077s) 15 being the justification trotted out on this occasion.

No one would have been brave enough to argue that the word in J.N. Darby's translation from the original language might be wrong. In truth, if you kept your pet outside, wouldn't that spare it the veterinarian's needle? You would have been excommunicated on the spot for daring to question the infallibility of our beloved JND's version of the Bible in an attempt to keep your pet.

[Pity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4113s) the poor old souls whose only true companion was a beloved moggy or devoted dog, but they knew the score: have your pet put down or be excommunicated from the brethren. Most chose the former option. Not so incredible really when you think of the web of fear, finances and families, the three F's that above all else meant total subjugation of the rank and file of the Exclusive Brethren.

[If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4144s) you were faced with losing all contact with your family and you may well have a brethren finance mortgaged, plus you believed you risked eternal damnation if you defied an edict, what might be the result? The moggy would draw the short straw.

Another incident resulting from the "no pets" pronouncement happened to an EB family who lived a few doors away from us. One of the daughters had just purchased some goldfish and had proudly set them up in a nice glass bowl. Then came the directive. What to do? Perhaps the local pet shop might refund the money if the goldfish were returned quickly enough. After a short delay pondering this problem, my friend [eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4194s) put the fish in a container, went to the shop but she didn't get her money back. As he dropped them back in the fish tank, the owner insisted the fish had grown too much and he wouldn't get the same return for them as for baby goldfish, so my friend went away empty-handed.

When I did my research for the ABC TV Four Corners interview in 2006, I tried to find out if this 1960s mass extermination of EB animals had come to the notice of any veterinarian authorities, but surprisingly I drew a blank.

Little brethren children at the time were consoled in their tearful farewells to their unsuspecting and trusting animals by being fed the line that the rapture was imminent. What if it happened tomorrow, for instance? Who would feed the poor animals left behind? This blatant trickery of course worked like a charm on young innocent minds.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4263s)

So in reference where we were talking about the OneSchool Global teacher. Here is an article that is about the Exclusive Brethren and her time teaching at the fundamentalist Christian Church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4277s)

Yeah, so this article is by a teacher that used to teach at OneSchool Global, which is the brethren's own schooling system, which all brethren members, their children have to attend these schools to preserve them from being contaminated by the evil world outside in their view.

And the teachers in these schools are not brethren members because brethren are not allowed to attend university, so they can't get a teaching degree. And the teachers often have very traumatic experiences trying to cope with this fundamentalist Christian culture.

And this is what one of the teachers wrote. "The attitude of pupils was what I found most shocking after some time. It became obvious that they, due to their confined living arrangements, were outwardly extremely racist and homophobic, and due to the fact that they considered animals other than humans (although to a brethren pupil a human is not a member of the animal kingdom) [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4348s) no souls, they abused them on a regular basis."

"Brethren do not keep pets, but were very willing to share their experiences of torturing various different animals, from birds to rodents to chickens and cats, to the degree that I decided to invite the Scottish animal welfare charity, SPCA, into the school to give a talk on the penalties involved in animal cruelty. I introduced a [gerbilarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4379s) into the science lab which helped some students to eventually realise that other species were not useless as they enjoyed handling these animals at any given opportunity and were left puzzled as to why they felt bonded so much with beings that were soulless. It was a very confusing experience for them but one which I hoped would help to teach them respect for other species at least."

"I also learned from discussions with them [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4409s) animals or people different to themselves that they had very little knowledge of the terms ethics and morals and were even suspicious of them. I found this astounding, especially from 17 and 18-year-old pupils."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4427s)

Oh, I'm trying so hard not to cry. It's so, isn't that just heart-wrenching? Heart-wrenching that she witnessed and was able to put that together that they were dumbfounded and confused as to why they were connecting to them.

And you know, even if they believe they're soulless, it still should be taught to be kind. To me, if you want to consider yourself a true Christian, that's just what is in there. That a true Christian is somebody who is kind to everyone and everything, no matter what it is. The earth, the plants, you're kind to your garden, you should be kind to animals. It should envelop the entire human experience. Just because they believe something is soulless doesn't mean that you should be cruel to it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4476s)

I mean, who is being soulless in that account? Exactly. It's the brethren that are soulless, not the animals.

### [**Lara Payne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4484s)

That was a very succinct paragraph which is, yeah, it sums it up really well.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4492s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4494s)

If you come across any of this in your path, it's super important to report these kinds of incidences, right? These schools need to get some sort of education added into it. We talk about this, about them having sexual education. Well, this needs to be education that's implemented in there too.

And so I guess why we're doing this and why we're exposing such graphic material is to make sure that everyone is aware of how [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4524s) community treats animals. And if you see it and witness it, please report it to the respected authorities in your community. There's tons of people, every community usually has an SPCA, please reach out to them.

It's not necessarily about always reporting it because you want them to get into trouble. It's not. It's educating. We need to make awareness so that these people become educated on how to treat animals. And yes, there are tons of people in this world that have the same kind of belief. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4555s) grew up in the PBCC and we can see the correlation between how they treat animals and how they treat humans. And we just know that this is another stepping zone into repairing their foundation. So thank you guys. Thank you, Lara, for joining us. Thank you, Ben, and thank you, Richard. And yeah, let's just hope that this helps hit some people's homes.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4577s)

Yep.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgyBZQ5ENOU&t=4578s)

Thanks everyone for watching. Until next time, much love to you all. Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
