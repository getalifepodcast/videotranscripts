## Summary

EDIT**Craig has asked for a minor correction to be added. In this podcast, he says that Eva Hales was withdrawn from in 1965, but she was actually never in fellowship. News reports from the time describe how Eva disagreed with Exclusive Brethren doctrine, and as a result, she was ultimately cut off from her Exclusive Brethren family due to the new separation doctrine. Her death certificate gives her cause of death as suicide 'while in a state of mental depression'.***
Bruce D Hales - Elect Vessel - Man of God - Leader of the PBCC. But who is the man? How did he climb to such extraordinary heights within the PBCC?
Join us as we celebrate Get-A-Life’s 100th podcast and extend our thanks to Cheryl, Lane, Carman, and Richard for starting a movement that has escalated in an exponential manner that none of us thought possible. It was their idea to create a safe space to have conversations about our experiences with the brethren. It is a credit to the platform that on this 100th podcast, an anonymous insider felt safe enough to join us.
In just under 18 months, the movement has cataloged many harrowing stories and exposed the many malpractices, harm, and detriment caused by the leaders of this cult. The evidence is building through the stories told.
We probe into the history of the Hales dynasty; a story that dates back to the 1960s. We delve into the accumulation of wealth attached to the family and illustrate the contrast between Bruce Hales’ lifestyle and that of the ordinary members of the brethren.
Relating first-hand accounts of interactions with Bruce Hales gives an insight into the character of the man and the ultimate control he has over the brethren.
Where will it end? How much wealth is enough for Bruce? We speculate on the answer to those questions but extend an open invitation to Bruce to join us on a podcast to tell us himself.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6s)

Hi everyone, I'm Cheryl, an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church from Maple Creek, Saskatchewan, Canada. If you are new here and just watching this, we started Get-A-Life Podcast over a year ago and today's episode is a huge milestone for us. It is our 100th episode. And I wanted to just come on here before the UK team dive into today's podcast and give a massive shout out [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=36s) those that have come on and bravely shared their stories. Without you, we would not be able to do what we are doing.

I don't think anyone of us in our wildest dreams would have thought that this movement would have reached what it has reached. So many lives have been changed. History is being recorded. This is about future generations looking back, listening to truth, and understanding where they came from. It's also about changing narratives that are meant to keep us separated and divided. The truth always breaks the [chains,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=75s) and each one of you have helped us with that.

I also want to give a huge thank you to Olive Leaf Network. And I urge many of those insiders to make sure that you are reaching out to all the available supports that are out here now. And please, please do not hesitate to contact authorities if you need it. And I just want to say that to remember change happens when we use our voices. Change happens when courage steps up, comes forward and speaks [its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=105s) truth. So I want to say thank you for having the courage to come forward. Thank you for wanting change to happen. And thank each and every one of you for your voices. Here is a message now from Richard and Ben and the UK podcast with our 100th episode. Much love to everyone.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=125s)

Who would guess when we started the Get-A-Life podcast that such an amazing community would grow out of such a simple idea? Why is that? If we go back to the very beginning of the Brethren movement, we see that it was founded on the idea of separation, exclusion, exclusiveness. It was founded on a negative. It was all about who we are not and about shunning and despising people who disagreed with us. Jesus told a parable that perfectly [illustrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=155s) the Brethren. The Pharisee who stood by himself and prayed, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men.

We are the inevitable result of this wicked and unchristian idea. We are the scapegoats. They blame all their problems on us and cast us out into the wilderness and thereby feel better about themselves. Having been raised in an isolationist cult, we are then faced with the huge problems of adjusting to a world [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=185s) is as strange to us as a foreign country. What the Get-A-Life podcast has done is to tell us that we are not alone, we are not strangers, and that from our suffering we have developed superpowers of resilience, empathy, compassion and honesty that collectively are stronger and more durable than Bruce Hales's Empire of Lies. So to all our listeners and all our contributors, we want to tell you that you are welcome, loved and needed and [included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=216s) Thank you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=217s)

Firstly, I just want to say a huge congratulations to the Get-A-Life team. The awareness that you've raised with your podcast and the safe platform that you've given for all of us to come forward and share our stories has been monumental in exposing what is a very toxic environment, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church cult, and in particular for my community, the LGBTQI+ community that do not have a voice in there and also including the women that [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=247s) in there that are voiceless, that live the suppressed brethren lifestyle.

I just want to say on behalf of the people you've helped out here, thank you. I know there are a lot of other non-community members that also have had so much help and insight, be that teachers, people that work for Brethren businesses, that are struggling, people that have had relationships with people within the church and don't understand why they're not, you know, why they've been left ghosted. [Thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=277s) you. Thank you on behalf of all of us. You do an amazing job at Get-A-Life. And also thank you for letting me come on board as a guest speaker and speak about my community, which is near and dear to my heart.

I personally had been told by Bruce Hales that there were more people in the Brethren that had overcome being gay than that had left. And since then, it's been really nice to see that turn around. Just last week, I had a message from somebody in the UK saying, thank you so much for your platform, the Get-A-Life platform, and sharing your story. Because it saved me from marrying a woman and falling into the cult trap, realizing that there is a possibility to live a happy, safe [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=321s) successful, more importantly peaceful life outside of the cult. So thank you so much, congratulations on this milestone and I look forward to many more.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=331s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm Jacky and I'm here with my friends Gilli, Ross, Craig and Ai. And this is an incredibly special podcast because this happens to be our 100th podcast. I couldn't really say much without giving a huge nod to those that started the Get-A-Life podcast. So just [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=361s) a year ago Cheryl, Richard, Lane and Carmen got together and had a discussion and broadcast it on Get-A-Life podcast channel about the Brethren.

And I don't think any of them had any idea how this would go and how it would escalate. But here we are just over a year later, nearly 18 months later, and we're on our 100th podcast. And I don't know, before we go into what we actually plan to discuss on this particular [podcast,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=391s) I don't know if the others would agree with me, but I personally think it's a brilliant way of cataloguing the stories of ex-members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, putting them all in one place and realising the parallels between them. But also, it's a way we hope and we know of reaching out to those inside.

And I would also add that things have grown so much in the last year. That's why the UK team are here to try and help Cheryl, Richard, Lane and Carmen. But I think the full credit goes to them for starting this whole initiative off. We would also like, because this is the 100th podcast, to give a huge nod to the incredible work done by Lindy Jacob with the Olive Leaf Network. And the Olive [Leaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=445s) Network, as everybody knows, is there to support members, to signpost them in the direction. And I know that Lindy has worked tirelessly on setting this up. So we'd like to say a huge thank you and a huge nod out to her. And as with all these podcasts, the link to the Olive Leaf Network, will be at the bottom of this particular podcast. So I don't know if any of you four wanted to add anything to a little bit of the just over a year history of the Get-A-Life [podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=475s)

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=476s)

I think that it's been a hell of a year. So many people have left. So many people are in the middle of arranging to leave and these podcasts have been absolutely monumental in helping insiders leave the restrictive cult that they're part of.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=498s)

Yeah, I'd agree. I'd agree. I mean Cheryl says she's continually contacted on the info at Get-A-Life email, isn't she, by insiders. Not always necessarily wanting to leave, some are, some aren't, but with queries, questions, information. So it has been quite incredible. The other thing we wanted to do, because we understand that a lot of younger and younger people within the PBCC are listening to these podcasts. So we thought it might be helpful just to do a very quick introduction of ourselves [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=529s) where we've come from. We'll keep it very brief.

So most of you know I'm Jacky Hart and I left the Exclusive Brethren as it was known then some 40 years ago now. So a long time ago, and I have been working in the last 10 years particularly to help people leave and to try and raise awareness. I don't know if you others would like to introduce yourself for some of the younger generation.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=553s)

Yeah, I'll go ahead. So my name's Ross Turner. I was local in Swaffham in Norfolk. I was withdrawn from in 2014 because I'm LGBT.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=564s)

Thanks Ross. I'm Abi Thompson. I was married to and still am married to Bruce Thompson in Coventry. We were shut up September 2022 and withdrawn from February 23\. We left due to a number of factors. We were treated wrongly and terribly, probably, [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=595s) I was from as far back as I can think. And then post-marriage we were treated like shit. And then we also became increasingly aware of how many victims of child sex abuse there are within the PBCC and we did not want to bring up our child in that kind of environment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=622s)

Thanks Abi.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=626s)

I'm Craig Hoyle. I came out of the Exclusive Brethren as it was then in 2009 when I was 19 because I was gay. My story's been fairly well covered publicly and I recently published a book called Excommunicated that tells my story so if you're interested you can check that out too.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=644s)

Thanks Craig, that's going to be my next holiday read. And Gilli?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=650s)

Yeah, my name's Gilli. I was local in Birmingham, UK. I left in December 2012\. Had to leave because I chose a relationship with an outsider, and that was the reason that, yeah, I had to leave because I had to make that choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=675s)

I was just going to say, I think all of us have done personal podcasts over the last 99 episodes of podcasts. So people can look back. And obviously the four original members, Cheryl, Richard, Lane and Carmen, they introduced themselves right at the beginning, I think, of podcast one. So if anybody wants to know where they're coming from. And Richard certainly has done a personal podcast. And I think Lane has as well. So there's plenty of info there if people want to find out who we are.

I would also add that what we do, we do because we all feel very strongly about the harm that's caused by the Exclusive Brethren, now known as the PBCC. We don't do it for money. We do it in our own time, as well as living our own lives, because all of us have managed to get a life. So, yeah, of one sort or another. So, yeah, I'd like to add that too.

So for [our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=734s) 100th podcast, we thought we would talk about something quite, I was going to say special, but I'm not sure that's the right word. No, it's definitely not. We thought we would talk about something quite unique. And we were going to have a sort of delve into and have a conversation about what is known about the leader of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, Bruce Hales. Not somebody I've ever met, not somebody I know a lot about. So I'm very much in the hands of those that [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=764s) know more about him.

But we thought it would help to sort of understand perhaps a little bit about what makes somebody want to be a totalitarian leader and maybe a little bit about his background from those that know him and from those that have had encounters with him. And I suspect some of the things we discuss maybe a bit of what I'd hope would be a bit of an eye opener to some people. And Craig, I know in your book you gave quite a detailed background to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=794s) Hales family dynasty. Perhaps you could just fill us in sort of what happened in the 60s with Bruce Hales's father and uncle and the impact that might have had on the current leader, Bruce Hales.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=807s)

Yeah sure. So Bruce Hales or BDH who's the current leader of the Brethren is 71 this year. He was born in March 1953 and I think probably one of the things that had the biggest impact on him and his family was when his uncle, Bruce Hales Senior, married Consie Taylor when he was five in 1958\.

And I think the senior Hales brothers had always been ambitious. They were sort of local Sydney leaders at that time, but when one of them married JTJr.'s daughter, that really turbocharged the power that the Hales family had in Australia and New Zealand.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=846s)

Just to put that into context, in the 60s, JTJr. was the current man of God at that time, wasn't he? So that's why it was seen. Is that why? Just for those that don't quite know the history.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=857s)

So James Taylor Jr. was the man of God at the time in New York, and his daughter Consie married Bruce Hales Sr. in 1958\. And that really turbocharged the Hales brothers. They took control of the Brethren in Australia and New Zealand to a large extent and then sort of increasingly around other parts of the world. And there was a lot of focus on business at that point. Bruce Hales Sr. in particular [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=887s) been a time and motion studies expert and was heavily focused on maximising business efficiency.

And so in the 60s, you had people writing down, sort of documenting every minute of their day, and then handing in those timesheets to the priests to be assessed to see whether they were using their time as efficiently as the Brethren could. And that came, so you had Bruce Hales Sr. and John Hales travelling around, visiting Brethren businesses, giving advice and telling people what they should do, what they shouldn't do, how to make money. And it came to a head in 1965 and JTJr., who was a man of God at the time, perhaps hadn't been aware of the extent to which the Haleses were A, trying to control businesses and B, trying to control the Brethren.

And he was, JTJr. was in hospital for an extended period of time in 1965 and while he was in hospital for alcohol-related illnesses, the Hales brothers did a lot of traveling and essentially it was an attempted [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=960s) grab trying to cement themselves as leaders of the Brethren in JTJr.'s absence. JTJr. came out of hospital in 1965, realized what had happened, and promptly had the Hales brothers withdrawn from. And I think you can't really, yeah, and alongside business control, as that insider is saying, it was also full-time control including hours of reading ministry.

And I [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=990s) when it comes to understanding who BDH is now, it's really important to know these things that happened when he was younger. So he would have been 12, 13 when his father and uncle were withdrawn from. And sort of building up to that point, the Hales had been ascendant in Sydney. They were the people and they were treated like royalty in the Sydney meeting. And at that point there were 2,000 people local in Sydney gathering at the Ashfield hall. And so you can imagine what it was like for these Hales kids being Brethren royalty. People feared their fathers, people respected, bowed down to everything they said.

So you had these [Hales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1030s) kids that were at the absolute top of the pecking order and then John and Bruce Hales Senior were withdrawn from. And so for BDH to have that experience as a young teenager, to go from the top of the pecking order right to the bottom all of a sudden, a huge blow I think to his, but not only to his but also to the wider Hales family's ego. Sort of a crushing defeat and to have been smacked down by JTJr. himself.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1060s) John Hales, Bruce Hales Senior, ate a lot of humble pie in 1965\. John Hales was back in 1966, but it was a sort of always a fraught relationship from that point between the Hales family and the Sydney assembly. And so John Hales was withdrawn from again in 1976, and he was out of fellowship for two years at that point. Then he was withdrawn from again in [1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1090s) and didn't come back until the beginning of 1983\.

And so there was always this tension about how much control the Hales family had in Sydney and how they tried to exercise that. And there's a lot of talk now by BDH about how John Hales was mistreated and how he was put out of fellowship wrongly. And I think the reality of it is when you take a step back and look at it, like on three separate occasions the Sydney Assembly [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1120s) uncomfortable with how John Hales was acting and took action under the instruction of whoever the current man of God was at the time. So we had JT Jr. in 1965 and then Symington in 76 and 79\.

And the line from BDH now is that JTJr. and Symington misrepresented the facts about what was happening with John Hales and there is a revision about what happened with the Hales family through the 60s and 70s. But it had a huge impact on BDH through that time. He'd married in 1974 and so he was in the beginning of his married life when his father was withdrawn from the second time. And I think one of the things that's most telling is that [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1175s) BDH talks about how badly his father was treated, but through the 70s when his father was being withdrawn from, he was making a big show of telling Symington that he fully supported the Assembly Act and against his father. So I think it's clear that BDH has always known which way the wind blows when it comes to figuring out where the power is.

And Symington brought John Hales back in 1983\. And from there it was really a remarkable rehabilitation. So John Hales was back in 83 and then by 85 he was back attending the universal meetings and then through 86, 87 he was taking the universal meetings. And it's quite astonishing when you think about it for the Brethren to have been out of fellowship three times, including for more than three years, and then to suddenly be back taking the universal meetings because Symington's too sick.

And I think part of the success of John Hales at that [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1245s) was because when he came back in, he was very, very firmly enforcing the rules for Symington. And so we saw Ron Fawkes withdrawn from in Perth and they talk now about, you know, dispensing with rival leadership. And John Hales, as we know, became the Man of God when Symington died in 87\. And beginning from that point, there was an attempt to sort of revise what had happened in relation to John Hales being thrown out and the Sydney assembly, Sydney meeting held an assembly meeting to reverse all of the decisions that had seen John Hales withdrawn from.

And I think we were often given the example of David and Solomon when it came to John Hales and Bruce Hales. David was the one who started the kingdom and Solomon was the one who built the temple and took it to new great heights. And the parallel there is that, or so the version went, that John Hales knew he had been mistreated, but John Hales himself couldn't be jumping up and down about having been mistreated. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1324s) so it took, it took BDH becoming the Man of God for the John Hales revision story to really kick off.

And that began in 2002 when John Hales died. And leading up to that point, BDH had been increasingly deputising for his father, who was dying of cancer, getting involved with assembly decisions and sort of screening everything that was coming to John Hales. So he was intimately aware of what was happening within the Brethren at that point and increasingly making calls on behalf of his father. And so when John Hales died, although there was speculation that the leadership could go to New Zealand or to the US, it was pretty clear that Bruce Hales was stepping into his father's shoes whether anyone liked it or not.

And I think one of the things that is most telling is Bob Thorncroft wrote a letter to the Sydney meeting in July 2002 raising concerns about the fact that Bruce Hales was stepping up to the leadership and the way he had acted in Sydney. And he quotes Bruce Hales, BDH, as having said,

“The Hales name has been dirt for a number of years but it is going to be different now.”

And I think, yeah, I think that really speaks to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1421s) leader’s mindset in that the Hales were at the top and then they were at the bottom and now they're back at the top again.

And now that we're back at the top, as our insider says, BDH is now using his father's history in revenge fashion. Like he has an axe to grind. There would really be a church meeting without it coming in with the clear attempt to make anyone that agreed with the JSH judgments to keep their head down. And that's, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1451s) remember being at multiple meetings in Sydney where this came up and it was all JSH this and JSH that and we've seen it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1459s)

In Barbados, haven't we? Yes.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1461s)

Yes. And this is the, this is the tension in Sydney. As Sydney is seen as the center of the Brethren movement and it's the most blessed place, but the Sydney assembly is also the place that withdrew from John Hales three times. And so I think BDH has this really conflicted relationship with his own meeting because it's the center of the Brethren universe, but he's also got these deep, deep grudges about the fact that they kicked his dad [out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1492s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1492s)

Out of interest, was anything known about, particularly the first time BDH's father, John Hales, was kicked out, withdrawn from, was anything known about what happened to BDH? And the reason I ask that is because quite often if a father is kicked out, the children, depending on what the mother does, the children go and live with other families. Do we know anything? Did that happen or did his father leave the house? Is that known at all? So I'm just thinking about the impact of that. I mean, I had to live away from home. It had a big enough impact. He was married, wasn't he?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1524s)

No, no, in 65 he was a young teenager. He was the youngest of the family. My understanding is that the children of John and Helen Hales were still in fellowship at that point.

Yeah. And by 1976 he was married. And then as a young married couple, because of course Bruce Hales Senior and his wife Consie were out of fellowship for much, much longer. And at various points, at least one of his first cousins stayed with Bruce and Jenny Hales. So I think it's sort of been said before, I imagine BDH knew how harsh it was to have your family kicked out and so on.

Well, he does know, that's kind of the point. The Hales family have been just as brutal as anyone else at kicking people out. And you know, in the 60s, John and Bruce Hales and Bruce Hales Senior withdrew from their auntie who then went on and committed suicide, Eva Hales. And so I think you've right through the Hales family, you've [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1592s) these sort of tragic circumstances that have affected the Hales just as much as anyone else. So they know what it's like. They know how harsh it is. And that's the point. They're inflicting pain on other people the way it was inflicted on them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1606s)

And it's interesting, isn't it? Because if people have had pain inflicted on them, there tends to be they continue the cycle or they break the cycle. And I think we know what's happening here. It seems to be. So when Bruce Hales came into power, I mean, all of you will remember that except me, I think, yeah, because I left so long ago. Did things change significantly? It was what, 2002?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1631s)

2002\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1633s)

Yeah. Did things change significantly at that point or?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1637s)

Massively, massively. So one of the first, so Bruce Hales announced when he came to power that there was a day of grace. We often heard about the dispensation of grace. The idea being that we were no longer going to threaten people, we're no longer going to punish people for breaking the rules, that sticking to the rules should be motivated by sort of love and loyalty rather than fear of punishment. That was a spectacular failure because [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1671s) people really realized that they could break the rules and not be punished for it, immediately people broke the rules.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1676s)

And that also coincided with what we, I was outside at that point, and what we call the Glasnost period, where the review, when we all got contacted by family we hadn't, we called it as outsiders, we all got contacted by relatives that we hadn't seen in years. And you know, I don't know if what was said inside, but the impact on outside was really quite marked because we [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1707s) lot of us met up with relatives and my husband saw his parents for the first time in 27 years.

And it was hugely emotional. And then all of a sudden in 2003, which I think is what you're perhaps leading on to Craig, the shutters came down again. And although he had some minimal contact from then and, and it was almost like you dare to open up your heart a little bit to your family. And I saw my brother who I hadn't seen for best part of 25 years. You dare to open up your 20 years [heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1737s) to your family and hope, and then the shutters come down. And actually the second time around it almost hurts more.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1743s)

Yeah, yes. And that impacted my family. Like my grandmother for instance was told, oh sorry, your parents shouldn't have been kicked out in the 70s and your husband shouldn't have been kicked out the 80s and your son shouldn't have been kicked out. And it's like, it's too late by this point. Your parents are dead and your husband was long married to someone else on the outside. Like it kind of made it, like to go through that cruelty and that pain for the sake of the Brethren was bad enough, but then [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1773s) be told it was wrong, all for nothing, made it so much worse.

I think again, this came back to BDH's sort of obsession with his father having been mistreated and all of these wrong assembly decisions that had supposedly, and they were terrible, you know, people were being kicked up for all sorts of ridiculous things. But part of his logic, I think, was that if John Hales had been wrongly treated, then there were boundto be lots of other people who had been wrongly treated.

And so the review was going back and looking at every excommunication or assembly decision in the last 50 years and seeing who else had been wrongly withdrawn from. But the strange thing here is that John Hales had kept scrupulous records of everything that had happened while he was the man of [God.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1828s) He had a filing system at his home in Sydney and it was sorted by locality and then alphabetically. So if he was to look up something about, you know, Craig Hoyle from Invercargill, which was where I was local, he could go to Invercargill and then flick through and find H for Hoyle and then there would be a record of everything, all correspondence that had crossed his desk that related to me.

And so there was this really comprehensive [record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1858s) of what had happened and who had been withdrawn from and why and what the priest had said. And when Bruce Hales Jr., BDH, came to power, he said that it was a new dispensation, that was an era of grace and all of John Hales's records were shredded. And they called in a document destruction company and loaded all of the documents and hid them. So Daniel Hales's sons were in charge of watching to make sure that every piece of paper was destroyed.

And it was two pallet loads worth of documents about Brethren history and assembly decisions and so on. And the truly, truly bizarre thing is that two pallet loads of documents were destroyed and then BDH turned around and ordered the review, which was, oh, let's go back and look at all these decisions. Well, it's too late, too bad, we just destroyed records.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1919s)

You're just relying on everybody's memory then, which is about as fallible as anything, isn't it? If you're going back 30 years, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1926s)

So then I think that opened the door for this revision about what had happened because you were going on people's memories rather than the records. And this went badly wrong for some of the leaders in New Zealand who got in trouble for withdrawing from this person or that person. I remember one in particular who stuck their neck up and said, I'm not saying sorry for withdrawing from that person, I just did what John Hales told me to, and here's my copy of the [letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1956s) from John Hales where he said to withdraw from them, where upon this person got kicked out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1965s)

Wow, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1966s)

So there's always, there's been this huge revision of Brethren history under BDH, and a big part of that has been revising what happened in the 60s and that John Hales and Bruce Hales Senior should never have been withdrawn from, and all of their business instruction has come back to the fore.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=1988s)

Sorry Craig, the insider sent me a direct message rather than to the group, but whilst you're talking about the review, the insider wrote there were suicide cases in the review that were looked at and then glossed over again as there had been court cases involved where the Brethren publicly said they never did anything wrong and in the review they were saying it was wrong. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2015s)

And there was so many cases like that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2017s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2020s)

The business side of things was something that really kicked off again under Bruce Hales, BDH. So going back to the 1960s and saying, hey, that focus on business, the system goes, there was nothing wrong with that, we're going to bring it back. And I remember around that time, this like astonishment from older Brethren who had lived through the 60s and the system days were like the worst possible thing. It was [terrible,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2050s) it was dreadful. Everyone knew how wrong it was and now suddenly it was coming back.

And the mental gymnastics that people were having to go through to reconcile themselves with that. Of course, for the younger generations who didn't remember the system days in the 60s, it was a different situation. So I think the older Brethren, these are people in their 70s and 80s now, have a lot more disquiet about [remembering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2081s) those system days and all of the different versions of events that the Brethren have told about these things.

So it didn't take long for BDH to, so within five years of becoming the man of God, the Brethren were back to holding business seminars and we've since seen the rise of UBT and this focus on making money. Including, sort of the strange thing is that BDH has been intensely focused on clearing JSH's name and making sure we all know that JSH was blameless and that John Hales did nothing wrong, but at the same time as all this is happening, he has quite happily overturned a lot of his father's ministry on things like computers for instance, or fax machines or mobile phones or any number of things that John Hales spoke very clearly against. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2133s) BDH has been quite happy to tip all that out the window when it comes to making money.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2137s)

When BDH first introduced, you know, the sort of business go-getting, did it come into the Brethren meetings or was it kept separate in those early days? Was it, was the business initiative kept very separate with business meetings, but it didn't sneak into the assembly as they would call it? Yeah, because what was commerce in the assembly? Was that JSH or BDH? That was 60s, that...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2163s)

That was the 60s, that was the System.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2165s)

Yeah. So it's what Bruce Hales Senior and John Hales and that actually, I mean what they used to do, they used to encourage young people in the meetings in the 60s to sell products and they would actually bring small products along like, Betterware was one that springs to mind, and they would sell them to the Brethren after the meeting for a profit. So this would happen afterwards and that was what was commerce in the assembly that they said was wrong, had to stop. But it was [basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2195s) very elementary, buy something and sell it for a profit. They were just using the Brethren as their customers.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2201s)

Like a giant Tupperware party.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2203s)

It was, yes, it was after the meeting. I don't remember it, but Andrew, my husband does. He remembers it as a little boy, you know. Yeah, yeah. So that's what commerce and the assembly, they literally were selling products after the meeting to Brethren.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2217s)

Okay, so it's not actual ministry that was being, they weren't talking about business.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2226s)

They were definitely doing that as well. Like you guys, JSH's ministry from the 60s and it's full of talk about business and I'll see if I can...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2237s)

More so than now or less so probably?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2240s)

About similar, but there's references all the way through the 60s of John Hales in the meeting giving people advice for their businesses and talking about how he would go into Brethren's businesses and one of the things he said in 1964, I think it was in Adelaide, he said he would go to Brethren's businesses when they weren't there and have a snoop around their offices to see if there was anything they weren't saying. And if he found a locked cupboard in their office, [he'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2271s) go looking for the key for the cupboard because nobody had a right to be locking cupboards in their workplaces.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2277s)

This was like quite full on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2280s)

That's incredible. That's incredible. Yeah. I mean, it just shouldn't happen, should it? Anyway, I'd like to do that in Bruce Hales's business.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2290s)

But certainly when I was at school, so high school sort of around 2004, 2005, by that point in our Bible studies lessons, the Bible studies lessons about, because you had to study all the elect vessels, the men of God, and the Bible studies lessons about first were a complete mix of his moral life and his business life. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2320s) so you couldn't really pull the two apart.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2323s)

Yeah, and I wanted to pick up on something you said. Now again, it's it, John Hales I understand was very anti-computers, anti-technology, anti-mobile phones and everything else. And I wanted to sort of touch on how that has changed. In fairness, we should add that the world has changed on that score in the last 20 years. So it's not, but my memory from what I knew of the Brethren after I left, but in the 90s and early 2000s, they were [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2354s) anti-technology.

I remember a school teacher in a normal school where I lived at the time telling me she had Brethren children in her class. This would be late 90s. And the father came in, was absolutely adamant his children shouldn't even touch the computer. Just to put their fingers on the keyboard would be wrong. The world has moved on since then, but if the Brethren have also moved on. And how did that change?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2383s)

I think the computer situation came down to the practicalities of business and the need to make money. Like, you know, it'd be very, very, very difficult to run a business now without a computer. And others here would remember when the Wordex machines were rolled out around about 2007, 2008 and out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2405s)

Yeah, were you involved in those, Gilli? Were you?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2408s)

Yeah, so I worked for, so when the computers were introduced, first introduced, one of the things that the, one of the things they did was kind of used people who had, like prior to Brethren's careers being much simpler, they'd used Brethren who had experience from, you know, 60s, 70s, 80s, who had experience in computers. And I was working for a company at the time who were involved in the repair of the early computers.

I mean, at the time, they were literally, they were called Wordex because essentially, all you could get on them was Word, Excel, and Outlook. You didn't have, there was no internet access. They were literally just very basic PCs that they would, well, pieces that they essentially built themselves and tried to put a protection system on which were, for those for those who were technically minded, were quite easily hackable in the early in the early days. But yeah, I mean, that like Craig says, that was around 2007\. And I think I remember it being quoted at the time that Bruce Hales had said his father had wanted to introduce them in the nineties, but the Brethren weren't ready for them. That's, that was what was quoted at the time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2493s)

So that's about 2007-ish, that kind of, yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2497s)

Yeah. And he said that, he said that his father had wanted to introduce them in the nineties. Like Craig said, it was becoming very difficult, you know, prior, prior to the computers being involved have been, you know, being in brought in, there was, they brought fax machines in. Before that they were using local businesses to, like, I remember Brethren using a local post office fax machine to have to run around to the local post office to get a fax that was, you know, someone had [posted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2527s) it, faxed an order through.

And yeah, so it was, it was around that time they started to use computers. And then at the same time they introduced, in the early days it was car phones, which were basically phones that were installed permanently in the car and still had a corded handset. But they were very, very heavily restricted. I think you could dial four numbers and you were, you had to sign.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2561s)

Was that only three people were supposed to be allowed to know your car phone number?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2565s)

I was just going to say you had to sign a document that you're only, you would only give your number. So it was basically the office, your partner and one other emergency contact. But I think what, what's kind of, yeah, 2007, but we're in 2024, but if you look at the comparatively how quickly they've gone from those early days of car phones, very, very basic PCs to then mobiles where they bought a, they went from car phones to at one stage, they trialed phones in bags, which were basically a receiving device still with a corded handset, but you know, you could pull out an aerial of the back for those, because I think a few Brethren had sort of said, look, we're in construction. We need to be able to talk whilst we're on site rather than running back to the car and things like that.

Then they introduced, I think it must've been like a load of mobile Nokia mobile phones that were yeah, pretty much going pretty much at the end of their lives. And when they were introduced, I mean, it was, again, it was similar kind of thing to the car phones, you know, you're restricted dialing, you had only supposed to, you know, you're only supposed to have so many people who knew your number. You know, those early Nokia phones, they had the cameras removed, they had the number of ringtones reduced, they had the texting facility turned off.

Yeah, and it very, but it very, very quickly escalated from that to then BlackBerrys were introduced, which again, obviously you could email from your handset. And obviously computers were evolving all the time. Then laptops were introduced. They were called Lapex at the time because it was a kind of a development from Wordex. And then they introduced, you know, restricted internet browsing and you had a white list of sites that you could visit. But I think the thing we look at is how quickly it's gone from very, very primitive devices to what they've got.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2713s)

Like this primitive.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2714s)

Yeah, kind of.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2716s)

Nokia 6151\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2720s)

Yeah, and there's just a little message from the insider, and it's become clear why the change. All computers are now fully owned and distributed by UBT now. So UBT obviously being closely associated, I think it's a polite way to put it, with the Hales family. So if you like, it's a captive market for them, isn't it? We'll distribute these devices, but you have to get them from us for your own protection.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2745s)

Yeah, I think one of the quotes that was put out at the time about, because I think someone did actually question the cost of computers. I remember the quote being put out at the time from Bruce Hales was, there's no price too high to pay for your purity.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2765s)

Okay. And another interesting thing, so that was 2007\. Yeah, and just a little note from the insider, anyone who works at UBT is told that BDH is the overall manager. So whatever the hierarchy, the belief is, UBT equals BDH inside, I would imagine then.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2786s)

Can you finish the rest of that message? Also, the insider says that everything is fed through the Streamline 3 network where every search, every data transfer is able to be reviewed. It's like Big Brother in North Korea is watching you. This is the ultimate control that was clearly wanted.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2808s)

Yeah, can I just say? It comes at a hell of a cost. Like I've never had a UBT phone. So no, that's a lie. I was brought a UBT phone when I was a teenager and yeah, I got into a lot of with it because I got about a three grand phone bill.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2828s)

Were you texting all over the world, Abi?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2832s)

I've just come back from simply what you expect. Yeah, but if you compare the prices in there, so you know, I've got unlimited data, unlimited texts, unlimited calls. I pay like 23 pound a month.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2846s)

Yeah, and that's at...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2847s)

…least 100\.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2849s)

Yeah, and that's the point I would very much like to make to any insider who is watching. If you are finding things difficult financially, you can cut your phone bill overnight, probably. It's not a lot, but every little helps as they say. And interestingly, we've got a quote from 2003\. So Gilli, you were talking about these first bits of technology coming in 2007-ish. In 2003, BDH said;

“I was [privileged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2879s) to be at those meetings with beloved Mr. Symington in Winnipeg and I remember getting smitten that I never should have touched it. Much mercy, I had disposed of it, but I had had it and hadn't seen the danger in it.”

And he was talking about computers. And then he goes on to say;

“But see, in 1982, it's just come back to my mind that as I recall, if the Brethren didn't give up their computers immediately after those June meetings, it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2909s) a test of fellowship. Some persons lost their lives over it, lost their wives as well, went out of fellowship, lost their families, lost their wives over just hanging on to a stupid computer, a stupid computer.”

That was 2003\.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2926s)

Four years later.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2928s)

Yeah. So I always say you'd almost have more respect for the Brethren as a whole. If they believe technology is bad, stuck to that and live their lives accordingly, not sway with the wind.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2943s)

And of course, what you've got, what the situation, like I can distinctly remember the place I was working, there was an older guy who was in the Brethren, and he really, really struggled, like once computers were introduced, and he really struggled with like getting his head around it, saying, you know, at the time he would have been in his fifties, sixties, all of his life, he's been, you know, he's, and he's probably had to stand up to, like you say, school and places like that, saying, no, no, we can't touch [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2973s) because they're, you know, and everything's, everything's wicked about a computer. And all of a sudden, he's now working in a place where we are repairing and developing the computers. Yeah. I think there was a whole lot of the older generation who really struggled.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=2991s)

Found it because of what they've been, what they believe, that technology was wrong and it was pipeline of filth and it was of the devil. And the other thing I thought perhaps we'd want to touch on this score. My understanding is that people inside are told you need, I mean, the insider has told us everything's fed through Streamline 3 network where, you know, it's monitored what they do. My understanding is the Brethren insider told you need that to protect you from the internet. You need that to protect you from all the wicked things that are out there on the internet.

All five of us have completely unlimited access to the internet. Is it a problem? I mean, just to try and explain, you don't have to look things up. You don't have to, you know, there's, there is a dark side to the internet, but there's also an awful lot of good to the inter, from the internet and a lot of information.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3045s)

For example, domestic abuse, yes, websites, sexual abuse websites, etc.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3052s)

Suicide.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3053s)

Help lines, aren't it? Yep, yep. LGBT support, all can be found.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3060s)

On the internet. I think it's been said in ministry and I think it was said in it because I'm picturing where I was sat when I heard it. Bruce Hales shouted down the mic that it would be folly to compare ministry from the present to ministry from the past because times have moved on.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3088s)

Probably always did, wasn't it? “If all the great men were in a room at the same time, they would all agree.”

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3095s)

Bollocks\! Imagine if JSH came back now. I genuinely think that even he would be mortified.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3103s)

Yeah. I mean, I think there's an element of truth. The world has changed. But as a comment from the insider, 

“There's been significant commercial turns the Lord has made under BDH. Business premises can be co-joined.”

That's interesting.

“ For example, UBT has three floors in a multi-tenant building. Previously, all buildings were entirely separate.”

 Well, I remember this from my day and you absolutely could not share a tenancy with another business. It would be seen as an unclean yoke. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3134s) yeah. So it's interesting, isn't it? That there's a joke amongst ex-peebs and about, you know, the Lord has turned another corner, but it must be very confusing for those inside, as you said, particularly the older generation that have had to get their heads around things and then have to change their thinking.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3152s)

And also outsiders who have literally, like I could, I'm thinking of a couple who had phones and were kicked out of home and literally had to sleep on a park bench. And then they really struggle in turn because all of a sudden they sort of see Brethren in a supermarket, they've got a smartphone.

What is going on? Yeah. And they literally lost their family and...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3180s)

Everything. Their lives were destroyed and they had to put themselves up and get a life for a certain reason. But it's not easy, is it? It's not easy. The other thing I wanted to try and touch on, I obviously don't know BDH personally at all. I've never met him. I don't know what he's like. But I know there are people, I mean, Abi, you've actually met him, haven't you? Is that right? Certainly. I know that some people have sort of written in with their stories and their feelings of what they got when they actually met him. But Abi, tell us what your thoughts were just as a person, clean or not. Hey, we're talking to Abi. Did he have, I mean, some people say, oh, he has such a great presence, you know, did you find that? Because some leaders do have a kind of charismatic presence, don't they?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3232s)

He told me that he was going to be a father to me and that never happened. I've written down a story. I will just bring it up. My first interaction with Bruce Hales was when I was 14 in 2012 when my family was over on an encouragement trip. We stayed with Graham Kenard who was at the time local with Bruce Hales in Eastwood. He interviewed my parents after the supper meeting, asked my father what he did for work, asked my mother how she was doing and [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3271s) handed him a letter.

He then chatted to my little brother and asked him what I was doing for schooling. I think I just said GCSEs. Mum stuck up for me and said I was doing well. His advice was to keep praying, keep close to local Brethren and never give up. We then returned to the UK for a short period of time for an incident happened with my father when I was 15\. It was Bruce Hales's guidance that I should be sent straight to Sydney with my aunt. I moved [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3301s) several households in Sydney and as I settled in, he started to acknowledge me slightly, such as with a nod, hello.

The second interaction was I left the meeting room through C door with Amy Proctor, daughter of Steve, who I was living with at the time. As I think they had kind of arranged for me to speak to him, I walked through, so you go out of C door and then there's like an automatic sliding door and [between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3331s) C door and the sliding door, there's like these red ropes with gold hooks on the end, like very ornate, like royalty almost. Anyway, I went through this, went through this sliding door and he ignored me at first. And then I think one of his sons went to get him and he strode over and was like this far from my face and he said to me, what do you want?

And I said, and I was just like, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3367s) words wouldn't come out because that's not what I expected. I was like hoping for like a hug or, are you okay? Because he knew my backstory to why I was there. No, it was, what do you want? And so the words that came out were, I'd really like my cousins to come over here. I couldn't have actually thought of anything worse than my cousins coming over, but anyway, that's what came out.

And his face kind of hardened and he looked at me dead in the eye and he said to me, you don't need to wear skirts that short, do you? And I was like, okay. And I think I should...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3412s)

How short are we talking?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3414s)

I'm going to say a couple of inches above the knee.

### **Craig Hoyle**

Oh no.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3427s)

What I want to say at this point is I had been through the worst sexual abuse and I was sexualized as a teenager. I thought that my only worth was what I looked like. So he should have been able to see that if he was this, you know, man of God, you know, why is this girl dressing like this? What's been going [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3457s) in her background? And you know, but no. And he said, you know, that's not the way to attract men, don't you? And I shook my head again and he said, good.

And then he said, I can't have you seen coming out of here looking like that. You need to leave via the fire exit. And so, and then he said, is that all right? And I said, yes, Mr. Hales. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3488s) I walked over to my right, out of the fire exit. And as I turned to walk, he turned to a group of lads that were stood by the door that I'd come through and I heard him say, what a mess, that's what not to go for, lads.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3507s)

I mean, my first question about that conversation to me with my 40 years out of the Brethren head on, that's a wholly inappropriate conversation to have with a teenage girl.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3519s)

Absolutely and...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3521s)

It's not, it's just not.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3523s)

Time, yeah, was one of utter turmoil and you know, I hadn't come out about the sexual abuse then and I didn't know why I was how I was. And he basically just twisted the knife. The comment to the group of lads that behind me was [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3553s) yeah, really upset me. The Proctors were entertaining that day and I walked around like a zombie. Following Saturday, rang up Steve Proctor and said he thought that he's a bit harsh with me. And he told Amy to take me skirt shopping and he gave them $150. Bear in mind with Sydney fashion, this wouldn't even buy half a skirt. At the Sunday reading, he pulled Steve Proctor into the minister suite and told him to tell me to write a letter with everything that had happened in my [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3584s) and I had up until 5 p.m. that evening to do so. So from 3:15 until 5, I scribbled down most of my life. My third interaction...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3594s)

Could you explain what the minister's suite is?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3596s)

Yeah, sure. So minister's suite is in Sydney as I remember it. So I don't know if it's changed since. So you go through this door and essentially in Sydney, there's this big huge garage is what I'd call it. There's a garage door one side, like automatic, and then there's one the other side as well. And Bruce Hales comes in and parks in there. And from my memory, there's a little [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3626s) little room off to the left where he would take people in for a private interview. I've heard that there's wine in there and all sorts. I think that I think there's full sets of ministry and photo books as well. But now every locality around the world has got one of these ready for when he comes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3652s)

So pretty amazing. Okay. Did you have any direct contact with him?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3659s)

Yeah, I met Bruce a bunch of times.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3661s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3662s)

The first time I met him was around about 2006 when I was 16 and we were in Wollongong for fellowship meetings. And this was back in the days when long before there were minister's suites and he would just walk out of the meeting through everyone and then you just all pressed forward to talk to him.

### **Jacky Hart**

Yeah, I've heard those stories. I just...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3684s)

Remember it as being absolute chaos because, and I fully understand why they needed the minister's suite because there would just be hundreds of people sort of jostling to get to him. And so I was like jostling through the crowd with my dad. I didn't care. I didn't want to talk to him, but my dad needed to talk to him because they'd banned advertising in the Yellow Pages, and that it had a really terrible effect on our family tire shop. And so [dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3714s) just needed to get to the front of the scrum to ask BDH if we could advertise in the Yellow Pages again because otherwise our business was a bit screwed.

So we got to the front of the scrum finally and he was just about to get in the car outside the hall in Wollongong and dad talked about the Yellow Pages and he said that we could advertise in the Yellow Pages. So that was a big relief. But then, so I had already started asking questions about Aberdeen at this point because I had [gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3745s) down to the local internet cafe and Googled the Exclusive Brethren. One of the first things that came up was all the talk about Aberdeen and pictures of JT Jr. with his hand around, like his hand on Madeleine Kerr's breast. And I had started asking dad about it like, what's going on with Aberdeen? Like this doesn't seem right.

And so we're standing there talking to BDH, by this point he's sitting in the passenger side of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3775s) car outside the hall. And just out of the blue, he hadn't, dad hadn't told me he was gonna say this, but just out of the blue he's like, oh Mr. Bruce, could you say something to set Craig's mind at rest about Aberdeen?

I was 16\. I was just like, just about, you know, the floor could have opened up and swallowed me. And in BDH, he was just, he was very, like almost like he didn't even think it was worth talking about. And he's like, well, what it comes down to is absolute folly of ever doubting the man of God in the first place. It’s  like, well, you would say that. 

But my main interactions with BDH happened around, so starting from December 2007, he came to Invercargill, and by this point, I had come out [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3828s) the local priest as gay, and they arranged a meeting with BDH in December 2007\. And at that point, I genuinely thought that he would be able to wave his hands and make me not gay. No, but as a teenager, we genuinely, we were taught that he had that power. Like he's got a direct line to God and so if he goes like, you know, you'll make you straight, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3858s)

It's actually quite hard to get across to somebody that's never been, I mean, in my day it was Mr. Symington, but the feeling was just the same. But quite hard to get across to somebody who's never been in this situation how revered this person can be that you've been told from birth or whatever is the man of God. It's basically like Jesus, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3879s)

Yeah, and it's, and it's also like...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3881s)

So I get where you're coming from there Craig. He would just touch your head or something and that would be it, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3886s)

Yeah, yeah, like an anointing, yeah. And like even, even as Abi was saying, even if he appears kind of ordinary, the circumstances in which you meet him, like he was in Invercargill and he had flown in on his private jet and they had all of these, you know, they do all their security things. So he always traveled in a blacked out car and there would be two different convoys traveling and nobody knew which convoy BDH was actually in. And then they had people on [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3916s) the street corners waiting to make sure there were no journalists or photographers waiting to ambush him.

And then there was a marquee outside the hall. So there's this huge apparatus around his arrival. And it's like you're waiting for, you know, the president or royalty to come sweeping. And actually it's more, it's more over the top than what you have for the royalty. But so there's this huge sort of atmosphere around his arrival. And even if you don't personally believe in it, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=3946s) really easy to sort of get swept up in this whole, this whole structure, this whole performance. And so when you meet him, kind of, you're amped up even if you don't believe it.

And so I met him after the meeting, after the fellowship meeting in Invercargill and I believed that he would be able to wave his hand and he didn't. And instead he told me that there was no future in being gay and that I should never accept myself for who I was. And it was like quite a bleak conversation because there was like, there was no help. He's like, basically you just need to fight who you are for the rest of your life.

And then he recommended that I talk to Roger Kirkpatrick, Dr. Kirkpatrick, who of course was his cousin and also a medical doctor that was used by the Brethren. And long story short, I ended up, there wasn't time to talk to Roger Kirkpatrick in Invercargill because they were about to leave for the next fellowship meeting in Oamaru. And so I ended up being sent from Invercargill up to Oamaru, missed BDH and Kirkpatrick in Oamaru, got sent to Temuka, which was the next fellowship meeting.

So I was just sort of hopping my way up New Zealand's South Island following BDH. And crossed paths with them again in [Timaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4031s) And it was the thing that really stuck with me from that day is that they had a stash of letters for BDH from local brethren, you know, and then, you know, the kind of letters that he was saying, you're pouring out your heart and soul, talking about your circumstances. And he was given a stash of these letters from Brethren in Timaru and he was just sitting in the lounge, [dozens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4062s) of people around them in the big circle, you know how they do, and just going through these letters and like reading them out and talking about people's private circumstances out loud in front of everyone and asking the local priest, oh, like what can you tell me about this family or that person or so on.

I was like such a, like I was shocked by it even at the time. And I thought, you know, that I know some of these people, well, I knew all of them, but I, you know, some of them knew quite well. And I was like, how would they feel knowing that their sort of most, their inner most thoughts in these letters were just being discussed out loud. And so I think my impression at that point, you know, people think that BDH is a pastoral figure, but my impression at that point was that he didn't particularly care about the people who were writing in letters. It was very business-like, just whipping through, reading them, saying they should do this, they should do that. What about these people? No, yes, no.

So there was nothing, didn't seem to me to be anything particularly pastoral about it. While this was all happening, of course, everyone's drinking. And I got sent outside to talk to Roger Kirkpatrick and had an even more disturbing conversation with him where the conversation got very sexual, including asking if I was sexually attracted to one of my local priests. And then back in the house, I ran into BDH again and he said that he would be talking to Roger Kirkpatrick about what we had talked about. And so it was very clear to me that not only was he sending Brethren to talk to doctors like Roger Kirkpatrick, but also that he was then following up and expecting Roger Kirkpatrick to discuss these people's situations with him. And so there were some very, very blurred lines around what was priestly care and what was medical care.

And I don't think the Brethren were ever very good at determining that doctor-patient confidentiality. That interaction with Kirkpatrick and BDH didn't save me and I tried to run away and ended up...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4208s)

I heard a story that I, it was told to me by a medical professional, non-Brethren, that was working in a private hospital in the UK and they don't work there anymore, but they told me staff there were very uncomfortable because they had a lot of Brethren people go through their hands and they were having to send reports of their medical records to Australia. And this was a non-Brethren person that told me that, which they felt very [uncomfortable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4238s) with. So I agree with you, Craig, I think there were some very blurred lines there. And of course, you'd never know when these medical records would be used against the person that is suffering, I guess.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4251s)

I want to know where all these letters and stuff containing really personal information is stored because for example, if someone's, you know, written out their sins and they're repentant and all that, if they've got it on file, then actually it's not, I mean, it should be burnt, it should be ripped up, do you know what I mean?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4281s)

So from, I mean, in the UK, from a purely legal point of view, if somebody is holding what is deemed personal information on you, and that's not necessarily something personal you've done, it could even be your personal details, that is protected data. And you hear these tales, don't you, in the news of companies that have been fined or individuals that have been fined because they're a data controller and they've allowed data to leak. I work in medical care and, you know, patient confidentiality is a huge thing.

So [again,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4311s) I'm saying this for the benefit of those that are inside and might be listening. You don't have to write down what you've done. That is your information. That is your story. That is your, I know they call it a sin. I'm not going to call it a sin, but you do not have to write down what you've done unless you can have some assurance of what's going to be happening with that information. And I doubt you would get that. No, [however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4342s) much they ask you to write it down or whatever, that you do not have to and the law would back you on that.

And it's quite interesting because the Get-A-Life team put out a request for some other personal encounters with Bruce Hales and three of them just tie in with things you've touched on, both Craig and Abi, because you both met them. I'm just going to read one of them out and it said,

“ I had several interviews or conversations with the man of God, as I thought of him at the time. [Every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4372s) time I was in his presence, I was absolutely hanging on to his every word and thought if I followed them perfectly, my life would change for the better. I spoke to him a total of five times and I can say now with clarity, he did not give any special advice or really do anything to change my life for the better. He clearly thought of himself suitable to give out advice and the way the Brethren behaved when speaking to him or around him was in total awe, as if he was God himself.”

 So that backs up how you felt, Craig, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4402s) you first met him. And there's also just a message, a chat from the inside that said he's good at creating an aura of “out of this world” experience. 

“I remember in his office, he said in there, this place is holy, H-O-L-Y, he spelt it out, as we sipped whiskey together.”

 That's a lovely little anecdote. Thank you for that. That's lightened me. Thank you.

So to go back to this person that sent their story. 

“Another time he said to me, are you on medication? Depression runs through families and we need to get it out. This is when I wanted to talk to him because I was depressed and suicidal. He suggested my husband came home for lunch in the middle of the day, middle of his work day. I didn't go on any antidepressant medication at the time. Some six months later, I wrote a letter to him asking what to do about continuing to feel depressed and he sent a message to me saying I should [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4462s) on medication.”

 After that, I never tried to contact him again because I felt he never really heard or cared about what I really needed and there was no real solution because there isn't one in there. Which again concurs with what both you, Abi and Craig, experienced in your direct dealings with him.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4482s)

What was that famous quote from Roger Kirkpatrick? 

“Half the Brethren are on antidepressants and the other half should be.”

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4488s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. That's a, yeah, that sums it up, doesn't it Craig? I remember that quote. This other one was a little bit disturbing and this is slightly akin to the conversation perhaps you had with him, Abi. 

“My parents found out I'd started a relationship with a non-Brethren guy. They were really distraught and my father after questioning of me called BDH. He got onto him straight away by phone. After relaying the ordeal to BDH, [BDH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4518s) also wanted a photo of myself and my boyfriend. He then wanted a recent photo of me which my father took and then emailed it through to BDH.

BDH then requested to speak to me. Once the phone was handed to me, BDH asked that I was in the bedroom with the door shut and also that I was by myself. He began the conversation by making sure of my name and then asked, confirmed that I was 22 years of age, which I confirmed. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4548s) then went on to ask questions about my position in the family and what a big responsibility I had being the eldest. He then went on to question my relationship with my non-Brethren boyfriend. He asked how many times did I have sex with him, which I replied that I had no idea. He then asked, didn't you keep a diary? which I replied no.

He then asked, would it have been 30, 50 or 100 times? When I replied, I'm not sure. I was terrified what [questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4578s) he was going to ask me next. BDH then started talking about sex freely to me and telling me that my boyfriend would have had sex with a lot of women. I gather this was a tactic of trying to turn me off my boyfriend. BDH then wanted me to fly to Sydney the following day to talk to himself in person. Of course, I declined the offer. I was too afraid of what might come next. I made up my mind on that phone that I, I made up my mind after that phone call that I didn't believe in BDH any longer. I tried to tell my parents and they said he would have said those things out of his love for me and helping me out. But I didn't see their love at all in what was said and I left home the following day.”

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4621s)

So I know someone from Sydney that left and he had an interview with Bruce Hales regarding his relationship with a girl and Bruce Hales asked if they'd had sex and that he then asked if they'd had oral sex and then he asked if he'd used his tongue. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4652s) then he said that's all right. And I forget the rest of the story, but after he, after like the interview, he kissed this lad. It's just, yeah, like if I look at the people that are at my church and like the elders, it wouldn't even cross their minds.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4679s)

And I think, sorry Ross, you wanted to say something. So we've just had a message from the inside to say in personal interviews where there has been sexual encounters, he delves into detail. He likes to know how long the intercourse was and what was involved. And picking up on that point, we had a young brother and sister that, as the Brethren would put it, committed fornication before they were married. And the local priest wanted to know what position they'd used and all [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4709s) intimate details and it's, you know, it's just disgusting. It really is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4713s)

Yeah. And again, to any insiders that are listening, details like that are not your, you do not have to share them. If you think anything you've done is wrong, that's nothing, that's between you and God, if that's what you believe. And you do not have to share intimate details like that at all. It's not their business to know, is it? No.

And then the third story that we had of a, you know, relationship or somebody actually came from a very recent leaver and they said,

“When I was about 13, 14 years old, I met BDH after a fellowship meeting. My sister was talking to him about getting married. As the conversation went on, he directed his attention to me and asked if I also had a boyfriend, to which I responded, [no.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4769s) And he said, good, otherwise we would have to kill him.

Roger Kirkpatrick was nearby and did his awkward cough and BDH said quickly, oh well, we will knock him down so he can't get up for 24 hours. I remember sobbing over this as a young girl. Everyone around me was telling me how amazing it was I got such direction, but I just remember being so sad. Looking back, I'm confounded that a man would ask a young girl about [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4799s) love life and then follow to talk about being violent.

Years later, when I was in my early 20s, myself and my parents were invited to his house for a Sunday lunch. At the end of the meal as we were leaving, I said thank you to him and handed him an envelope with $500. He responded to my thanks with, it was very nice to have your parents and see them again. That's it, nothing else. I remember feeling horrible after it [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4830s) such a long time. Why was it not good to have me? The tone of his voice and how he was so dismissive was something that has never left me. There is something about that man that I always felt like he despised me. He was a really hateful person that people just seem to fear unnecessarily.”

 And I would add there that we are quoting somebody's hearsay opinion. Is that fair, Craig? This was written by somebody and this is their opinion of the impression they had of their encounters with BDH.

And the one bit I wanted to pick up there, which is something else I understand happens quite a lot, this person said, I said thank you to him and handed him an envelope with $500. Is this normal?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4881s)

Yeah. Happens all the time, he puts it in a suitcase and for the rest of, well this is when he's abroad, for the rest of his trip he tries to get rid of it because otherwise he can get in trouble on the way back in.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4897s)

I was out for dinner with BDH once and he was like handing out money to young people and giving them up to like $800 each.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4906s)

In cash, of course.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4907s)

Everyone in cash.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4909s)

Wow.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4909s)

But then people say, oh look at how generous BDH, and so it's nice, he's just like passing off the money that someone else gave him. It's not like it cost him anything.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4919s)

So I mean, I'm going back 40 years, but we used to have collections in the supper and the collections were always cash and it was divvied up and then, you know, given out to various ministering brothers including the man of God at the time. At the care meeting. Yeah, presumably this is seen as cash donations and therefore not declared for tax purposes, I would guess. Would that be a fair comment to make?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4944s)

It would and you know, it's not small amounts of money either because we've got some figures that, so from the care meetings, if you take that there's 282 meetings, stroke localities worldwide, they contribute about a million Australian dollars annually between them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4977s)

I should point out here in the UK, you can accept donations up to a certain value per year, and I think it's three or five thousand pounds before you have to declare it for tax. And I'm assuming we're talking bigger sums than that. I don't know what the rules are in Australia, but I'm assuming we're talking considerably bigger sums than that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=4994s)

Well, I look back at Coventry care meetings and we were giving, this is when we were in, which would have been like nearly 18 months ago, and we were giving Bruce Hales between 1500 and two grand each month. So...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5013s)

Did the amount change each month?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5016s)

It depends on if he's taken fellowship meetings or not.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5022s)

Yeah, because I remember one of the, from memory, one of the things was to make sure that the amount that got given to him was changed up. Because if it was the same amount of money going every month, then it could be argued that it was income.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5036s)

Yeah. Whereas if it's varied, it's a gift, is it? So therefore, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I suppose what we don't know is how the money, I mean, if it's cash, cash can come and go, can't it? But we don't know. But what we do know is Bruce Hales gets, what is probably factual to say is he gets a lot of money in donations directly to him personally, not through a business, I would guess, but directly to him personally.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5064s)

The insider says cash gets handed out nonstop. Sometimes people give him a large wad of cash thinking they're doing their bit for the man of God. And then he casually gives it to the next person he talks to. I think I might go to a meeting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5080s)

It might be fine. I'll put my headscarf on and see if they notice.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5084s)

Just make sure you're the one getting the money, not the one giving it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5087s)

Yes, exactly. I could give some fake notes and then take back the real money. Anyway, yeah, that's quite incredible. That's quite incredible, isn't it? It does seem to be a very cavalier attitude about that. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5104s)

Sorry, one of the other things that has just come to mind is that, you know, back in the day, I don't know whether it still happens, you know, the cash that was given to different people at care meetings, if there was an overseas trip, because of the amount of cash being taken overseas, it would be divvied up between the different Brethren that were going on the flight so that, yes, you didn't have too much, any one person didn't have too much cash on them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5130s)

So if they did get stopped, it wouldn't be that, it wouldn't be sort of, yeah, found out there's a whole watch going through on that particular flight. Yeah, yeah. It's, it is a worry, isn't it? And then of course, we do know that allegedly BDH has amassed a huge amount of wealth, hasn't he? And I think what I want to try and draw is the contrast. I mean, there's been lots of stories going around that he's buying up properties and some of the [properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5160s) are very ostentatious in my opinion. I would add, where, how does this compare with perhaps where BDH was back in late 90s, early 2000s financially and the sort of properties he lived in?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5178s)

Well he lived in John Hales's old house, right? I'm just trying to think of when I was in Sydney, they took me around John Hales's houses. So there's one with a school in the backyard and then there was one that was in Eastwood which Charles Hales was living in when I was in Sydney, which they'd have still been really nice houses.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5208s)

I'm just going to share a picture now, Abi, of a compilation of houses that have been put together. And as I understand it, the second one along with the children's playhouse in the front, that was or is John Hales's house, is that correct?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5228s)

Yeah, that's correct.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5229s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And perhaps somebody could just talk us through what the other images are.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5238s)

Yeah. So the left-hand image is Gareth Hales's house in Sydney. The image to the right of John Hales's house is a property in Dural, which was bought by somebody else. We believe, we can't be 100% factual, but we believe it was bought for BDH and that cost $14 million.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5269s)

Is that the one that's under Dean Hales's wife or not?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5270s)

I'm not sure. I think it was bought by somebody else. I can't remember the name, but I don't know, I can't remember the name. (Gavin Grace)

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5278s)

Yeah. So and then the one on the right is a property in America in Greenwich, Connecticut, which Ross Markham bought for five and a half million dollars. And we believe, we can again, we can't factually say, but we believe that is being bought for the Hales family as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5300s)

Yeah, and they are quite nice looking places. And I want to put that into context with a quote from Bruce Hales. I'm not actually sure of the year of this quote, where he's talking about housing because of course we know, I think it was John Hales, was it, that brought in the edict that you must live in a non-adjoined house. So basically all the Brethren had to sell up and buy detached houses, didn't they? Sort of late 90s, mid 90s, something like that.

So Bruce Hales said,

 “But the matter of new housing, I suppose, I mean, of course, I can't go back all that far, but it came up prominently in the 70s. But I think we have to be considerate in places where you find it difficult to get suitable accommodation. Of course, along with that, it's a question of what we're prepared to be content with as well. We were using a few words earlier in the day that you wouldn't want anything ostentatious or grandiose. I hope these words are [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5359s) unintelligible.”

Now, I don't know when those were actually said. I don't have a date on that. It's a quote of his. And that's one thing that I find, I'm going to stop sharing my screen, one thing that I find quite staggering because 40 years ago, the house you lived in was irrelevant. When I was in, it was irrelevant. You could live, flats were always banned because of shared tenancy, you know, shared land, what [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5389s) had to pay with that was seen as an unequal yoke. So nobody lived in flats, but you could live in a terraced house, you could live in a semi-detached, you lived according to your means and you weren't judged on it. And I understand that's changed completely and is even getting worse under BDH's guidance.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5408s)

Absolutely. The pressure that's coming from the top and filtering down. I mean, if you look in the UK, I can only speak for the UK at the moment, but like kids that are like 20, 21 are buying houses 500 grand plus, 500 grand would be the minimum. 

**Jacky Hart**

And do you think they're overstretching themselves, Abi? 

**Abi Thompson**

Absolutely. And the way they do it is wrong too. So they'll put your wage up for three months so you've got three months slips to give to the bank to be like, look at the wage I'm on. And then they'll give you a huge mortgage and then they'll drop the wage back down and then all of a sudden you've got this mortgage and you're like, where's the money?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5467s)

So how are you made to feel, those of you that have left more recently than I have, or those of you that still haven't left yet? How are you made to feel if you can't afford, don't want to afford, and I will use the word, a grandiose house?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5485s)

You're absolutely looked down on 100%. And it's not just the house, it's what's in the house. Is it classy? Is it tidy? Is it clean? Is the food five out of five? Are you keeping up with the latest trends? Have you got the right clothes? Have you got the right brands? Have you got the right car? Let's see your engagement ring. Oh wow, that must have cost at least five grand plus. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5516s) it's all centered around money.

And I was talking to some friends about this today and it's actually against scripture. They quoted some scripture about an eye of a needle and a camel or something, but it's actually against scripture to live a life like what we're seeing the hierarchy of the church live. It's not actually righteous. So yeah, okay, it might be righteous in that they've got the money, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5547s) there's people that literally can't even put food on their table.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5550s)

One insider described it to me as a, one insider described it to me as a caste system. Yeah. And the other story, another story that an insider told me was about someone in the UK being ridiculed for serving Johnnie Walker Red Label to BDH, because you should be only serving him like top shelf whiskey, not run-of-the-mill whiskey. And so there's this, yeah, even when I was in, there's a huge pressure to only serve the best of the best. And like, you know how much top shelf whiskey costs and if you're [knocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5589s) through two or three bottles of those in a break, like that's a lot of money just on the booze.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5593s)

Yeah, I've got a little tip for the insider in the UK. Buy one top-notch whiskey, use it up, go to Lidl, buy the cheap one and pour it into the top-notch whiskey.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5607s)

Because you're right, Cognac is beautiful. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just a bottle. You're right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5614s)

Craig, and it's that feeling almost, I imagine in there, that if you're not serving the best of everything, I mean, it's trying to draw that parallel if essentially the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church claimed to be like a mainstream Christian church, I know we all say that with a little bit of our tongues in our cheeks, but let's say that's what they claim. What you have materially should not matter. It's what you have spiritually that should matter.

And I believe, like any company, the attitude at [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5644s) top filters all the way down through to the lowest ranks. And that is why, because what we're seeing with the wealth that BDH has amassed over the last 20 years, and the outcomes of it in the houses that have been bought, that has filtered all the way down through the PBCC. And I just think it's a toxic environment. I don't think you have to live your life like that. I don't know if you others would agree that that's changed certainly from when I was in.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5676s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree. And just on a personal note, we were right at the bottom of the pecking order and not very well off at all. And I can remember my mum literally being in tears because she couldn't afford to, you know, buy the best stuff and knowing that she'd probably get ridiculed for it. Yeah. You know, that the meal wasn't going to be satisfactory enough that, you know, it was really distressing to see, really.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5705s)

Yeah. And I remember something... It's real. It's real. The looks, the noses turning up, it's incredibly detrimental to your mental health.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5720s)

The worst thing was you're hosting a break and half the time that people who came to your place weren't even people you wanted to have in your house. You had no choice about who you get to it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5728s)

And you have to serve them the best whiskey. Yeah, yeah, I could imagine. Yeah, it wasn't that, that was still so in our day, you know, you were told who came around to your house and everything. And I always remember something that Richard Marsh said in one of the very early podcasts, and they were discussing the money within the Brethren. And he said, 

“I will always have more than the Hales family because I have enough.”

 And I thought that was very, that's quite a good way to look at it. You know, we all have [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5758s) levels of where we want to be. But if you get to where you want to be in life and you can maintain that level, it doesn't matter whether it's a caravan in a field or a six bedroom house.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5768s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5768s)

It's about what is enough.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5770s)

And that's, you know, I don't knock them for doing well in business. Okay, no, it doesn't bother me, but don't shove it in everyone's faces and expect them to live up to the same lifestyle that they've created.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5788s)

Going back to what our insider said earlier about sipping whiskey with BDH and that like takes, that was one of my, one of the last encounters I had with BDH because I think the drinking is really important to talk about when sort of these in the context of these meetings with senior leaders. And I had dinner with BDH when I was in Sydney and the drinking astonished me. I was between, I had [BDH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5818s) on, I was sitting right beside BDH, I had him on one side and Tony McCorkell, their former PR guy on the other side.

So I was wedged, wedged in between Bruce Hales and Tony McCorkell like literally shoulder to shoulder in the lounge. And he was drinking, BDH was drinking, he had tumblers and he'd put a bit of ice in the tumbler and then they were just filled to the brim with neat scotch. And he went through, he had five of those before we even got to dinner. And it was the most astonishing, well, I'd seen heavy drinking in the Brethren, but I'd never seen drinking [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5858s) heavy.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5859s)

Yeah. Did you drive home?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5860s)

No, he wasn't, been a long time since he'd driven himself at that point I think. But he then, he switched to wine during dinner and then carried on drinking after dinner. But he didn't seem drunk. But what really stuck with me on that night is later that evening, we were standing talking around, singing around the piano. Remember this old sing along?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5888s)

Oh yeah, yeah, I remember that. Yeah, we still, still did them 40 years ago, Craig. I actually really enjoyed them. Yeah, yeah, they were quite, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5895s)

They were, they were, they were great. They were, they were fun in their own way. And but we were standing around the piano sort of singing all these songs and Bruce Hales, you know, he loved that kind of stuff. He's in his element, like belting out some hymns, you know, The Old Rugged Cross and so on. And then someone, one of the kids in the group suggested that we sing Candle in the Wind. And of course, like Elton John had been banned at that point. Oops.

Gay degenerate as they saw it. And we all knew that we should not be singing Elton John songs. And then someone suggested that we sing Candle in the Wind while BDH is like right there by the piano.

Well, there was this awkward silence because there was this hush bell and we all looked at to see how he would react. Expecting him to be like, oh no, how about we sing a different song or whatever. And he was like, and to my utter astonishment, he was right into it. And he's like, yeah, let's sing that one. And so we like stood there around the piano like belting out Candle in the Wind and it was just like this moment of like utter cognitive dissonance. Because we had heard over and over and over, do not sing. And here's BDH belting out Candle in the Wind.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5985s)

Yeah, like without a care in the world. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=5989s)

And it made like absolutely no sense to me. Yeah. So it just, there were so many things like that where what was said in public and then what was actually done in private were two different things.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6005s)

Yeah, and I have a really good example of that. My third interaction with Bruce Hales was when I called him, no wait, I called John Anderson and his number, there's so, and by accident, complete accident, I got through to Bruce Hales and he said, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6036s) hello. And I said, hello, is that John Anderson? And he said, no, it's Bruce Hales. Charles, is that you? Charles, is that you? As if I was like his son.

And I said, no, it's Abi Jones. Oh, well, I thought you were Charles. And he was like, I thought there was something wrong. And I said, no. And he said, how did you get my number? And I said, I was trying to ring John Anderson. And he said, what's wrong? And I [said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6066s) oh, my friend, she's gone back to New Zealand and I think she's gonna leave and I'm worried because it's her cousin. And we went over that. And then he said, how are you getting on at school? And I said, I'm really struggling to be honest. The bullying there is awful. It's worse than I've ever had even in the UK.

And he said, I'm sorry about that. We'll get you down to Archway House. You know where Archway House is, don't you? And I said, yeah. And he said, come and speak to me down at [Archway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6104s) House. So I think it was a Wednesday, he said, and he said the time and it was after school, so in about half four or something. So I went down to Archway House, which we were living opposite Sydney room at that time, so it's just down the road. And I got to Archway and Bruce Hales wasn't there, even though he said he'd come and speak to me personally. And instead Gareth and [John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6134s) Anderson were there.

I'll rewind a little bit. He said the bullying will stop once you get in the clear and have this meeting at Archway House. So I went down to Archway House and spoke to John Anderson and Gareth, I went over what I had to get in the clear about, which was mainly non-Brethren music and a couple of boyfriends. And not that I had anything to get in the clear about because I was just like 15 and just a normal teenager. And I said to Gareth, it's really weird to me because in the UK no one is allowed pre-recorded music and yet I've come over here and I've gone to [Sydney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6187s) school and everyone has got earphones in and with their MP3s and they're listening to music like even during class.

And he said, yeah, we have a bit of an issue with kids and music over here. And so I said, okay, well it's really confusing for me because we are like under strict instructions that we'd not have non-Brethren music. And Gareth said, let me tell you a story.

“So as a young person, I've always had non-Brethren music, but I'll tell you a secret. You just don't tell anyone. And I've had to learn that because of my father being who he is. It's best you just keep it to yourself.”

 And it is literally one rule for them and one rule for the rest of the flock and it's not fair.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6246s)

And I think that's one thing that even when I was in the Brethren, I think it's got worse, that people really struggle with is that huge dissonance between what they think they should do and then what they sometimes see is happening. And I'll tell a very quick quote. My mother was always a bit of a rebel. And I remember when I was late, shortly before we left, having this sort of conversation with her, why is it? And we'd had a meeting about every man doing what was right in his own eyes. I can't remember where the scripture [is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6277s)

And, you know, how wrong that was, everybody was doing what was right in their own eyes. And my mother's comment was, I'll rephrase that. Everybody was doing, at least they were doing what was right in their own eyes. In other words, people were making their own choices that according to their own conscience about what's right and what's wrong. And I think that's something that's very hard to learn to do when you do leave the Brethren because you've been so conditioned in this tunnel to actually have, actually on my radar, my ethics say it's fine [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6307s) have pre-recorded music. And then that dissonance is really hard to come to terms with.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6312s)

Yeah. And then we got our message from Bruce Hales himself. Obviously Gareth had gone back to him and Bruce Hales sent a message to me saying you can have non-Brethren music as long as it's got pure content, no explicit lyrics. So it's just letting me off the hook. Then I came back to England and told my England priest that and they were like, eh? So this...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6340s)

Makes me wonder, do we think the Hales family really believe the rigidity of the Brethren rules?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6349s)

Definitely, definitely not. Gareth anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6352s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6353s)

Gareth's a rule unto his own.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6355s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6356s)

Which actually I really admire being who he is, you know, flipping fair enough if you've managed to keep going and do whatever you want right under your dad's nose and you've got to be pretty cunning.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6369s)

This was, this was not, this is not a new thing for the Hales as I mean, and BDH himself was just as flippant about the rules when he was younger. So my grandmother, so my great grandfather, Johnny Wright, was close to John Hales and through the 60s, you know, the Wrights and the Haleses, they went over to Sydney, stayed with the Hales family, the Haleses came to Christchurch and saw the Wrights. And so there was this interaction between [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6400s) two families.

And I remember my great uncle telling me, he left in the 70s, and I remember him telling me about Bruce Hales coming to Christchurch as a young man and coming to, I think I have a quote, so Bruce Hales, BDH, was in Christchurch and they asked him to take the meeting and it was all very, you know, one of the Hales is here, so on and so forth. And then my uncle wrote,

“ It was one of the [lighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6430s) moments to see and hear young Bruce making a damn good fist of aping a visiting brother. Afterwards we shot off to a nightclub and got thoroughly pissed.”

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6438s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6439s)

And I think that is a good example of how BDH and the Haleses more generally have been very good at talking a big game about the Brethren rules, but what they're doing in private perhaps doesn't necessarily really match up with what they're expecting of others.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6459s)

Yeah. Yeah. And there was something else I wanted to go back to. You touched on it, Abi, when you were talking about how young people in the Brethren have their wages bumped up for three months or four months in order to get a mortgage, in order to buy the type of house. And thinking about Brethren wages, now there's been a lot of talk of disparity between the wages of a Brethren member and the wages of a non-Brethren member within a Brethren business. Do we think this is something that Bruce Hales is aware of and would encourage?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6495s)

Of course. Look at UBT. He's over everything at UBT. Absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6502s)

Yeah. And do we think, I mean, there's a quote here that we've got that came from a 2015, the copyright goes to UBT. And it was from BDH himself. And the question to him was, 

“When non-community staff are hired at a lot lower rates of pay than community, how should this be handled to avoid discrimination?”

So there seems to be an open admission. It happens. They're just asking how to handle it.

And BDH's reply was,

“Well, if they are good non-community staff, give them a 50% pay rise tomorrow and tell them to [stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6543s) complaining or leave. The other thing I've always believed in the workplace that wages are confidential. The person in charge of pay, of the person in charge of the pay office should have no contact with anybody in the organization about salary levels or any other benefits except the boss. Just the boss. You understand that round here, don't you? This is a mafia town, isn't it?”

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6567s)

 Oh, he loves his mafia word, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6570s)

I mean, it's an interesting choice of word. We'll come back to that. But I work in an organization, I work in the NHS, and there everybody knows what everybody earns because you are not paid according to person, you are paid according to job role. So if you apply for a job role, it is worth x amount per, you have different point scales on there, but it's worth x amount per year. So the job is assessed, not the person. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6600s) I think if you go around in a business assessing the person or the person's needs, you're going to discriminate, aren't you? And that's something else that again, you'd want to say to insiders, you should be paid according to what a job is worth, not according to what your needs are, because that's a bottomless pit, isn't it? Your needs can go on up and up and up.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6625s)

I think the wages are a big sticking point for insiders that want to leave. I think it's a very deliberate way of keeping people inside because if you look at your role equivalent out here, you're paid like half the money. And because that's what the job is worth.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6644s)

I remember talking to one person who was leaving, helping them leave, and they were in a basic like office sales role with no degree, like no qualification. No, it's just like a basic on the phone role. And they were on $96,000 New Zealand or just under 100 plus a company car, plus living at home rent-free, plus bonuses. And so when they left, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6674s) wouldn't apply for any jobs that paid less than 100 grand a year because in their heads, that's what they thought they were worth. And it's like, you have no qualifications and no experience other than this like phone sales role. And as they've been saying, like you're worth less than half of what you think you're worth.

And that's a real, like it's not just a financial blow, it's also I think for a lot of people who leave, an ego blow to realize that you're not as good as you thought you were.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6702s)

Yeah, yeah. But on that score, I would say, look at what you've done since you've left, Craig. I mean, you know, many of us, I mean, as in that once you leave, if you can get over that hurdle and accept it, you can then equip yourself with the experience and if necessary, the qualifications. Isn't easy, but you can do that, can't you?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6724s)

Which you can't do. Like, you know, I left when I was 19 and it was easy enough to start again. But I look at people now that are leaving and you know, or thinking about leaving in their 30s and 40s and the commitments that you have with a family and a mortgage and all of these other things, like it's much, much harder. Yeah, it's easy enough, I think, when you're young.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6745s)

They do have these houses that they can sell and buy a perfectly suitable house. If they're bringing their family with them, obviously, even half of the house, if you, if your spouse and you're gonna have, probably, probably lose your kids, but even half of the equity, you're gonna, you will be fine. You will be fine. It's a big...

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6774s)

Well, that comes back to the point that you were talking about earlier about the expectations. I mean, I can remember before I left, so that's, you know, 11, 12 years ago, the instruction for young lads buying houses was four bedrooms, two bathrooms, you know, even down to what side of the street it was on in terms of whether it's south facing or whatever. And that kind of is like you just saying, I think [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6804s) one of what we'd say to people on the inside is that is completely irrelevant now.

If you are thinking of leaving, just that those requirements, you know, the thing about four bedrooms, two bathrooms was always about being able to entertain the Brethren and all that kind of thing. Chances are you'll probably never ever catch those entertaining levels again. And the times that you do, you don't need to worry about having a huge dining room with a [massive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6835s) long extending table with God knows how many chairs around it. But that's, it's the expectation and it comes back to what we were saying about the feeling of being inadequate if you don't have those and being...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6852s)

No one cares out here, seriously. No one gives a, yeah, yeah. It doesn't matter. People want to know you for you, not what you've got. It's completely, that's exactly...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6863s)

Yeah, when you socialize out here, it's about the people, not the things.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6869s)

Back in the 60s, Martin Luther King said that he longs for the day, he was obviously talking about racial discrimination, but the sentiments, he longs for the day when the world only ever judges a person by their character. And I think that was, you know, quite, if we stuck to that, it's not what you've got, it's their character, it's how they behave. I think that's, you know, a good message to get to anybody who's thinking of leaving. That's how we try and live out here. People are judged by their character, maybe judged isn't quite the right word, but not the size of the house they've got or the car or anything like that.

But these things are obviously important to BDH. I mean, his [external](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6914s) amassing of wealth is probably testament to that. And I am quite curious about this word mafia, where he said, this is a mafia town. Do we think that was a flippant giveaway or do we think that for those that perhaps know him better than I do, that that's how he thinks things are? We're speculating now, I appreciate that, but...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6936s)

They have a setup like a mafia in my opinion. They have the hierarchy, lucky, they have the money, they have the power, they have the brainwashing. They've been known to use, there's been proof that they've used criminals to frighten women especially that have left.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6959s)

But even if they don't go, I mean, the Mafia are renowned for basically, maybe this is me watching too many Mafia films, but shoot anybody who disagrees with them. But even if the Brethren didn't go to, or Bruce Hales and his followers didn't go to that extreme, the threat they use is excommunication, isn't it? It's there. It's like, which is a wonderful title for a book, I think, Craig, but it's there. It's like, that's the threat. Excommunication equals losing potentially everything.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=6996s)

And Bruce Hales in a recent white book was speaking to a guy from Argentina who had been held up in his house by, I suppose, criminal gangs in Argentina. And Bruce Hales went over, well actually the ministry, it was edited out of the ministry, but he went over that he's researched what guns he [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7026s) buy and he's narrowed it down to a 950 gun. And I think he sees himself as a bit of a gangster. I mean, you're literally talking in church about owning a gun.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7040s)

Yeah, but that other reference from those London fellowship meetings, I think it was where he said he would rather people came over and had a sword fight with him than about what they taught.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7053s)

Yeah, and I always thought it was funny, the idea of like BDH, and we all know what he's like physically, out there with a sword.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7066s)

That's quite an image, Craig. Yes. And then obviously we've got the rat poison ministry. Yeah, so it's all really graphic. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7076s)

Wasn't, wasn't there a reference to mafia in a phone call that Ben Woodbury had as well, wasn't there?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7082s)

I was just gonna bring that up actually. So I think it's quite interesting, you know, just to think about the language that's used by BDH, you know, when he says about the Mafia. The thing is, is that then the young kids and all the rest, all the rest of the followers take that up and think it's the norm to speak like that and use that sort of language. And you say, Jacky, Ben Woodbury got a death threat from a kid who was from one of the higher families in there. We can't, we can't name them obviously, but in the phone call, Ben asked who was calling him. Ben said, you know, who's calling? And the person said it was the mafia.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7137s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7140s)

So, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7141s)

Yeah, which again, what's said at the top will filter through the ranks, won't it? The rhetoric that's heard at the top will filter through the ranks and that's quite worrying. And you know, you don't know how many people, and this is, this is why I felt particularly keen about this podcast. It's trying to get across to my family inside and probably all your families inside what is really going on behind the scenes, because a lot of all of this would be hidden, wouldn't [it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7171s)

The money, the comments, the how people are treated would be hidden from most of the Brethren, I guess, would it? I don't think they've got any idea what's going on. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Do you think that the ordinary, lovable Brethren, our families, would have any idea of the kind of wealth Bruce Hales has amassed and how he's [amassed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7201s) it? I don't think...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7205s)

No, when I was in there, we knew that he was well off, but that was touted as his business success. And if we all follow his business advice, you know, we too could be rich like him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7218s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7219s)

So I think people knew he was well off, but what there probably wasn't, was at least when I left, which is 15 years ago now, there probably wasn't so much awareness of how the Brethren system had been manipulated to deliver profit.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7234s)

Yeah, yeah. And that's the bit that really worries me for people I know in there, is the system seems to be now from, you know, like Steve Simmons' podcast and other things that have come out, the system now seems to be manipulated to effectively end up back in the Hales dynasty somehow or other.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7257s)

The other interesting, sorry to interrupt, no go ahead. BDH often, I remember there being talk, you know, BDH saying when Aberdeen happens again. Do the rest of you remember that too? There was this fixation on the next Aberdeen and who's going to stick with BDH when the next Aberdeen happens. And I often wonder, like you see what's evidently happened in Barbados and so on, where BDH thinks this next big split is going to come from, what's going to cause it and whether it's just going to happen or whether it's something that he would try and engineer. Because the way they, yeah, and the way they've set it [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7301s) now is all of the, you know, the schools and the halls and so on all stay with BDH. And so if you could clear out half of the Brethren worldwide who didn't fully believe in BDH, you'd keep all the property on your side, you'd make an absolute killing.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7315s)

Yeah, and while we're talking about Barbados. I just don't know, it's going off piste a little bit, but it might be interesting to pull up a picture of how he actually travelled there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7328s)

So we understand that BDH has recently been in Barbados, hasn't he? Is that correct? I think he's back and he was ministering to the Brethren there. Now again, I know I keep talking about my day in the Brethren, but it's perhaps just to draw a contrast. When the leading brother was ministering and he would go and visit people in another country, he would usually stay with Brethren, you know, somebody would put him up in their house and so on. But we had note from an insider that this is where BDH was staying allegedly when he was in Barbados.

Yeah, so we had this word from inside that BDH when he was in Barbados was staying in this villa here, which looks [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7375s) nice.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7375s)

Imagine him in that pool.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7380s)

I could make a lot of comments there, but I won't. Oh dear. And this particular villa was quoted as being US dollars, 20,000 pounds, was that per night?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7394s)

Which I believe from the calculations we've received, it would have been about 40,000 Barbados dollars. Yeah, about double. And another interesting point as well is, you know, leaders who ministered in other countries used to use normal airlines to get to where they were going. Yeah, I think we have a picture, don't we, of how BDH got [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7424s) how he traveled to Barbados.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7427s)

Yeah, I mean, he apparently has his own jet, doesn't he? Which is, I mean, I'm not very good on jets, but apparently is something akin to this type of engine. It's just sharing now, that's it. Yeah, yeah. And this is his own jet.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7446s)

So not only he's traveling around this, that's what he's used to travel around America. I don't think that's the actual one that's his, no.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7454s)

No, that's not his actual jet, but it was something very similar to that, isn't it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7459s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7460s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7460s)

Yeah, just to put it in perspective, a jet like this, if you look on Wikipedia, a jet like this new would cost somewhere around about 11 million dollars.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7473s)

I remember when BDH came into Invercargill in December 2007 on his jet and the local brother, one of the local brothers, so weird that we call them brothers, but he was in the, somehow he got into the control tower for the airport and it's a like tiny airport. Like all we ever got was small regional flights coming in from places like Christchurch and suddenly there's this like private jet coming in. And [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7503s) was saying the comms between the pilot and the control tower and the pilot was like, basically, what's the speed limit coming into New Zealand? Because they were belting in from Australia quite fast. And he's like, what's the speed limit coming into New Zealand territory? And the control tower told him and then the pilot's like, yeah, but is that enforced?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7523s)

Yeah, yes. How funny. I heard stories about Bruce Hales in the UK that he has a special license that allows whoever's driving him to drive on the hard shoulders and there's no speed limit. It's just, who does he think he is?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7546s)

Yeah. Oh, that reminds me of another story when he was in Invercargill and we were told this story by the local priest who was driving him from Invercargill up to Dunedin. This was an earlier visit and they were driving, he loves to drive fast, I think this is like well documented. And if he's the passenger, he will tell the person who's driving how fast to go. I mean, it's well above the speed limit often.

But they were driving from Invercargill to Dunedin and passing these [cars](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DKuPbycSRzpE%26t%3D576s) and he was, BDH was telling the driver when to pass different cars. And they were passing a bunch of cars up State Highway 1, but we, you know, we call it a state highway, but it's like one lane each way for most of it. And they're passing a queue of cars and then approaching a blind corner and the driver went to like pull back into the queue of traffic. And then later told us that BDH was like, no, keep going, keep going, take the next car as well. And so they passed around a blind corner on State Highway 1, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7613s) but at speed to get in front.

And then the priest was like, well, like BDH said to keep going, so I did. Like this was some test of faith. And in the back seat, the priest's wife screamed and Roger Kirkpatrick was sitting next to it and he goes, oh, it's all right, BDH has got some heavy duty angels.

I remember talking about this later and my auntie was like, I'm not passing around a blind corner even if BDH tells me to. And then that was like, that became a thing because this was like a test of your faith. Like would you pass around the blind corner if BDH said no?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7652s)

Yeah, do you trust the Man of God, I suppose that could have become, couldn't it? Yeah, do you, yeah. I mean, it's interesting, isn't it? Because there was a documentary released in January this year about, and it was called The Disciples of TB Joshua. Now, TB Joshua was a charismatic evangelical leader in Kenya who recruited quite a lot of people from the UK and he's died now. He got, he died in his mid 50s. But the lifestyle he had was identical. He had people [enslaved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7683s)

They all lived in a sort of church together, enslaved to him. But his lifestyle was totally do as you please. Do you think that, I mean, I'm no psychologist, but if somebody gets to that position of power where they say jump and 50,000 people will say how high, that they begin to think they're infallible. They begin to think they're untouchable. Yeah, but the past dictators, nobody is, nobody who's human [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7713s) infallible. But do you think they end up believing that? You look at past dictators as well that have happened. I just think of your story about him. Did he think going around that bend, well, God's looking after me, so we'll be fine. And then of course, when he didn't hit another car, well, they'll all say, oh, that's because God was looking out for our brother.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7734s)

I've often, like I often wonder whether BDH actually thinks that he's the Man of God.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7743s)

Okay, right.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7744s)

And there was even when I was in, you know, there was talk because I think he loves the control and he loves the business side of things, that much is clear. But, and I remember when I was living in Sydney, he seemed reluctant sometimes to be a moral leader. I don't know if you experienced this when you were in Sydney Abi, but he was like, not always very keen on taking the meetings and not...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7770s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7770s)

Not always, but it was orchestrated.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7771s)

He'd be like, they'd ask him to take the reading and then he'd be like, no, no, I think someone over there should. And then like he'd like refer to someone and they'd then they'd pander to him. He'd be like, no, Mr. Hales, we'd love to hear what you..

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7788s)

Yeah, and it, correct. So I was, I was in Sydney on one of the rare occasions when someone else did take the meeting when BDH was there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7797s)

Wow, that poor person. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7803s)

And it was a really, it was a really sad, it was JTIII, like JTJr.'s son.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7807s)

Oh yes.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7808s)

That was kind of like, nobody would dare take the meeting when BDH was there. And so the only way to get anyone else to take meeting was for BDH to like tell them in no uncertain terms before the meeting that they had to take the meeting. And I mean, you know, JTIII was someone who was elevated enough, but you know, I mean, he said a few times, you know, I don't think I'm going to take the meeting, I think I'll just get Mick Hurrell to take the meeting instead. And then like behind the scenes, Mick [Hurrell's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7840s) family are saying to him, whatever you do, do not take the meeting if BDH is there, because it's like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.

But one preaching I was at in Sydney, it was the last preaching, you know, it was five, five thirty, whatever time of day it was. And we'd been out, Windsor or somewhere else for the main meeting and we came back and BDH was late and we'd all been sitting there waiting for him to arrive. And he came in quite late and then they announced who the preachers were going to be. And the preachers were always in order of age, except BDH who always went [first,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7880s) and then order of age.

And they announced the preachers and said BDH, this person, this person. And he just looked like haggard. He looked absolutely worn out, like tired. And BDH picked up the mic and he's like, I just need some time to like gather my thoughts. And and turned to the person who was supposed to be preaching second and said, would you mind preaching first so that I've got some time to gather my thoughts and then I'll go second. And they, and the person that he was talking to [refused.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7910s)

And it's like, just refused to preach first, obviously. So if you, if you agreed to preach before BDH, even if BDH has asked you to, then what does that say about your loyalty to the Man of God? And then like in that instance, I felt sorry for BDH because he's created this situation where like you have to be here.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7935s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7936s)

And even when he tried to pass it off to someone else, he couldn't.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7940s)

They wouldn't take, wouldn't take up the mantle. And that's one thing I think, you know, this is why I think this podcast is so important. So important for firstly, for people who don't know the Brethren to understand who it is that's leading the Brethren, but also for people inside to understand who it is that's leading them. From the perspective, BDH, he is a man. He is no different or better. He's a human being, no different, better than the rest of human beings. And he's built up this [aura.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7970s) And I think that actually typifies it in that story you've just told, Craig. There's this aura of he's infallible. You have to hang on his every word. And it's like the emperor's clothes. Is there really any substance there? And does he at any point think this is all too much, keeping up this appearance is all too much?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=7992s)

I think he does think it's too much, but when I was in there, you know, we, you know, there were stories of BDH saying he thought he was just going to retire as the Man of God and help people with their businesses. I mean, the businesses were his passion lies, I think. And like taking meetings isn't something that comes naturally to him. I don't think he'd ever taken three-day meetings before he became a man of God. And so there was like very little in the way of pastoral experience or spiritual leadership.

And I think he's kind of being forced into this position where, you know, he's got the control and he's taking this business leadership. And to me, the like spiritual side of things is just something that's been forced on him incidentally as part of that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8034s)

Yeah, and he's trying to manage that, but actually it's not where he wants to be. And you know, we've talked a lot about, I think we've talked a lot about how we've all perceived things in there, but what do you guys think would be BDH's end game? I mean, with these podcasts, people inside are listening to them. It must bring pressure on the system that is the Brethren system. Things are getting exposed now that never would have been exposed 20, 25 years ago thanks to the [internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8064s) and thanks to the way we can all communicate. What do you think his end game might be?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8069s)

I mean, if I can go first, yeah, go. I mean, this is quite drastic, but my fear is that he'll do another Jim Jones, where he'll suddenly say that, you know, we've all got to move to this enclave and he'll just do a Jim Jones. And for those in the Brethren that don't know about Jim Jones, Jim Jones was a very charismatic person, much [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8099s) BDH, if I can say that. And he moved his followers all to an enclave, I think it's somewhere in South America.

Yeah, and then when all the authorities and whatnot were getting really close on his heels because there'd been obviously sexual abuse and all sorts of other things going on, when the authorities were getting hot on his heels, he forced the congregation to take a drink, Kool-Aid, that was laced [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8129s) cyanide and then he shot himself afterwards. And I just, you know, I know it's drastic, but I just fear that, you know, is that going to be...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8138s)

BDH, I, it's drastic, but I share that fear with you, Ross, actually, because BDH runs a totalitarian group. He dictates to them and when a dictator's cornered, if indeed that's what ends up happening, and I hope it does, because there's too much coming out now for it not to be addressed. If a dictator's cornered, we don't know how they're going to act, do we? Not the other things just to be...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8165s)

Just to be, just to be clear, you're hoping that BDH is cornered, not that another Jonestown...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8177s)

Oh yes, yes, yes. Just to be absolutely clear, what I mean by cornered is that because so much is coming out, the authorities will start to look at the Brethren system in the way they should have done years ago, in my opinion. But yes, I agree. Thank you, Craig. Yeah. What do the others think the end game might be?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8194s)

I think it's, I think what Craig referred to earlier about creating another Aberdeen, which, you know, creates that those who are blindly loyal to him and have no questions. You know, essentially you look at other dictatorships and what's happened in history. It's getting rid of those people who don't believe and push those, you know, those who essentially, those who will blindly follow him will keep them and entice them some more with something else that they'll believe in. And those who don't believe, they'll find a way 

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8244s)

The old like the business principle where 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your best customers. And I think the Brethren are the same, aren't we?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8252s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8253s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8253s)

Yeah, they are. Yeah, I think, I think that the wives are going to be the issue in the end because they're so loyal to Bruce Hales and his, like most wives fancy Gareth Hales. And I think that's where they're gonna split up the families is by the wives being loyal.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8280s)

Yeah, so something that's been happening 50 years. Or longer…

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8287s)

I think that a walk out, and once one guy goes, all go. Well, not all go, but a large amount will go. And I think it amongst the older people as well, the older people can see right through it, but they're just too scared to go because they know the consequences are going to lose their children, their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8307s)

And the position a lot of these older people are in is if you stay in there, you can secretly break the rules and play both sides and see your Brethren family and your non-Brethren family. But if you leave, then you're cut off from your Brethren family. So you know, I know of older people in this situation who have decided to stay in because then they can break the rules and try and see both sides of their family.

But I think like the other thing, personally, I think with BDH now is he's very concerned with legacy building and setting the record straight about his father and making sure that his own legacy is in place. And like not to put too fine a point on it now, but he is, he's 71 and JT Jr. was 70 when he died, Symington was 74, John Hales was 79\. So, but [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8361s) very much into that part of his leadership where he'll be thinking about what his legacy is and how he transfers power to the next generation. And so I think that's something to watch is where the power's going to go and where he's going to hand it off to because I don't know how much more time he expects to have at the top of his pile.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8387s)

And we do know he's been quite ill this year, don't we? Sort of, yeah, with surgery and so on. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8393s)

And the thing is, he's already been, he's been in charge of the Brethren now for 22 years, which is the longest serving man of God since JT who died in 1953\.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8404s)

Yeah. Because he always said that because he was the seventh leader that he would be the last one because seven being a complete number…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8412s)

Going to be like the days of the week.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8415s)

I'm not quite sure how that computes if he's...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8422s)

Well, thank you very much, everybody. I think this has actually been, for me, who doesn't know Bruce Hales and was not under his rule, I found this absolutely fascinating. I think it will certainly help people who don't know the Brethren to understand perhaps a little bit more about the character of the person who rules our families that are still in there. But secondly, I hope if insiders are listening, just think for a minute. Just think for a minute. Think to yourself, where is my money going? Where is it really going when I give to that collection or when I go and buy at the Brethren's stores or I buy from the Brethren? Whose pockets is it really lining? And is that how a church should be?

And for me, I don't care about Bruce Hales' money. I'd be quite happy for him to take it and [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8474s) and live on an island somewhere. But let our families go. Let those, set those people free. I don't think he will do it because I think the power he's had for the last 20 years is too intoxicating. And I think it's a bit like a drug. But that would be my appeal. And come and talk to us. Come on a podcast. We've speculated a lot about you. Come and set the ground straight. More than happy to talk to you anytime, wouldn't we? Yeah.

Yeah. Thank you so much, everybody. It's been an absolutely fascinating 100th podcast and an incredible milestone that was started by our four friends overseas, Richard, Carmen, Lane and Cheryl. Thank you very much, everybody.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8521s)

That's great. I just wanted to add, I think it's very fitting that for the 100th podcast, we've had the first insider join us as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuPbycSRzpE&t=8530s)

Absolutely. It was very, very brave of that insider and their contributions much appreciated and we wish them well. Whatever happens, we sincerely wish them well.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
