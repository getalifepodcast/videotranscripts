## Summary

Older brethren look back on the 1950s as the Golden Age. No UBT, no OneSchool, no 6am suppers, no meeting every night, no mandatory “volunteering” for Campus&Co, no separate tables, no shunning of your nearest and dearest, no headscarves, just a dazzling array of fancy hats, and those manly suits and ties for the brothers.
Today, Get-a-Life brings you a STUNNING REVELATION. There is a parallel universe in which the 1950s peebs still live their happy and carefree lives. Like Tutankhamun’s tomb, or Jurassic Park, the Renton fellowship of Plymouth Brethren have frozen time and neatly sidestepped the grievous plagues and curses that the evil “Big Jim Taylor” inflicted on the saints. And there is more – we can reveal that it is actually the Rentons, and not the PBCC, that is the TRUE position, holding the standard while the rest of us poor buggers stumbled around in the dark.
Too good to be true? – probably, but you can judge for yourself in this surprise-packed interview with ex-Renton brother and Poet Laureate,  Paul Flowerdew. Paul left the Renton's to gain freedom for his family, just like those of us who left the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC. Tune in to hear the similarities and the differences.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2s)

Hi everyone welcome back to Get-A-Life podcast Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today with Richard and Lane and our special guest Paul from the UK. Welcome Paul.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=67s)

All right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=68s)

Paul is going to take us on a journey of where he comes from and we're gonna dive into the comparisons between the split that happened at Aberdeen and where he ended up at. So we're going to dive into the family tree of the Brethren movement from the post-Aberdeen split. And Paul is going to take us on this journey. So take it away, Paul.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=98s)

Okay. Well, thanks very much for having me on. So yeah I grew up in the UK.

I was born in London and as Cheryl said I was born into what's called the Renton Brethren.

So you might all be wondering what they are and how they're different to the PBCC.

So I'm going to go through a bit of my life history and I think as we go along and I kind of share some memories and stuff, it'll probably become clear sort of how they're different and how they're similar as well. There is a lot of shared stuff, really. I mean, in some ways, you know, I joined the Ex-EB group in the beginning of 2018\. We left in sort of early 2017\.

And at first, I felt like a bit of an imposter because you know I wasn't proper PBCC and hardly anyone else on there was from Rentons. Uh at the same time there was just so much that I felt you know sort of kindred spirits with with people on there and there's sort of so much commonality of experience and um yeah admittedly I know you know that you guys many of you have been through far worse than I have and you've had to put up with many more crazy rules and stuff and treatment and abuse.

So in that sense, I've had it much easier in some ways but at the same time, they're very similar in their background and all the meetings and stuff.

Yeah, so it's interesting. So, yeah, I was born in London in 1982\. So that was sort of 12 years after Aberdeen. And so basically what happened, I've got to stick up a dendrogram, part of the dendrogram here to show you where Rentons are in relation [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=243s) the PBCC. So if you can you see that guys?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=335s)

Yeah I can see it.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=243s)

Yeah so so the the Aberdeen split was basically here and that was 1970 and then obviously that's PBCC and they've basically stayed as one group more or less, haven't they? Apart from those who obviously like yourselves that have left.

But obviously you can see here that the other side has just split again and again and again.

So the group that my parents actually were with originally was this group, but then they split again in 1972\.

And that's where the Renton group really originated. So that's where I grew up.

And to be honest, I don't know a great deal about all the rest of these groups.

I call this sort of tree, tongue-in-cheek, the tree of strife, rather than the tree of life. Well, it is. I mean, it's just a complete car crash, isn't it, of Christendom.

Christendom of which they are part, as they like to say.

So, yeah.

So that's basically where I came from.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=335s)

So I think it was probably, was it about 8,000? Around 8,000 left, around Aberdeen. Yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=344s)

That's about the number I've read yeah. Um although um I don't know there must have been lots of uh sort of hemorrhaging and people leaving yeah in different directions after that uh because I mean the number that were in the brethren in the Renton brethren that I was with I wouldn't have put more than about 2,000. I never never actually counted them up I mean I could have I suppose I could have gone through the address books and done that. But, um, and it's probably fluctuated over time, but yeah, it's, it's not very big. And that's one part of actually what I was going to go into is that, uh, bizarrely in some ways I would have preferred to, to have been born in the PBCC from a, from a sort of companionship point of view, I might as well just say this now while I'm thinking of it, because literally I had the number of people my age, the number of boys my age, I could [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=405s) count on one hand in the south of England.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=407s)

Oh, wow.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=410s)

So, and, you know, they were sort of like a minimum of an hour away or, you know, up to two, three hours. And although obviously we had fellowship meetings and three-day meetings and there was sort of interchange in terms of my dad would go and preach somewhere and their dads would come and preach where we were.

So we did see each other from time to time. But given that we were not encouraged to have friendships outside Brethren, it's not that we couldn't. I mean, I did sometimes have the occasional play date with school friends and stuff. But it was clear that we were really supposed to be above that and separate.

So, yeah, it was quite a lonely kind of upbringing in that sense, because the numbers were just so sparse, especially in, well, more in England.

The density was greater in Scotland and I only clocked that when someone pointed out that that was because that's where the division happened so it was close to the epicentre of Aberdeen.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=491s)

Yeah, because nearly all the Scottish brethren left at Aberdeen I mean it was 90% or more of the Scottish.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=497s)

Yeah. Because either they were there or they knew or had family that were there and saw with their own eyes. Well, I mean, okay, they didn't see everything with their own eyes, but they saw the meetings, I guess, and what happened there.

Yeah, so we were sort of quite few and far between in some respects. I mean, it was worse in mainland Europe. My, come on to that, ladies, but my wife, Nadia, she's from Germany.

She's from Bad Endbach, if any of you have been there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=576s)

Yes.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=576s)

Because it's one of the main meetings in Germany. Still is for the PBCC, I believe.

And so yeah, I mean, she was one there were about three meetings, three Renton meetings in Germany. It was Bad Endbach, Cologne and there were a couple in the east as well. Jatnick up by the Baltic on the Baltic coast and I think Scheibenberg.

So it was even worse for her because it was next to no one. I mean, I suppose the only upside was that there were more conservative Christians generally in their schools there. So she had some friends that were more like brethren than I had over here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=576s)

Yeah, because we just had the podcast with Ailsa Schlaudraff, who lived in Bad Endbach. Yeah, I mean, that was where her husband was from. And so that's where she lived for many years. So yeah and I've been there it's a beautiful place. I didn't realise your wife she was also in the Rentons then. Wow interesting.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=599s)

Yeah. So her grandfather was Horst Pfeiffer.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=603s)

Oh right.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=604s)

He was a naturopath in Bad Endbach he was like the naturopath doctor.

And he was basically him and then his sister and her husband who left in 1970\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=603s)

I see.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=604s)

It was quite brave to do that because basically everyone else was against him. But yeah. And the other interesting thing while we're on a bit about Endbach is that, so I was going to position as well my relations in the PBCC. So my mum was a Ward from Stowmarket.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=648s)

No, you're kidding me. Really?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=650s)

Yeah. Why? Are you related to them?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=653s)

I grew up in Cambridge, which is 30 miles from Stowmarket. So we knew the Wards extremely well. Yeah, and there's all sorts of remarkable characters. I mean, you've probably seen Dr. Charlie Ward, who must be some of yours. Is he related?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=672s)

Well, yes, yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=674s)

You are. I mean, the likeness just jumps out at me immediately. Oh, come on. Yeah, I mean, like complete mafia.

Amazing story. So who was your grandfather, Ward, then? Who was your mother's father?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=691s)

I think he was Frank.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=693s)

Frank Ward, okay.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=695s)

I think both my grandpas were called Frank, but, I mean, they both died before I was born.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=700s)

Just to be quite frank, yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=702s)

Yeah, very good.

Yeah, so she had an older sister, Caroline, and she married Laurie Buckley. I think they're in Newton Abbot, down Devon Way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=717s)

Laurie Buckley's a big wheel. He's like the brother. Yeah, he's a solicitor. Attack dog, yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=722s)

He's been involved in litigation, I understand.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=728s)

He's a cross between the Pope and a pit bull terrier.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=731s)

Oh, right, okay. All I remember all I know of him is my dad saying that he was a bit of an oddball, whatever that meant. I mean I've never met the guy. So um yeah um yeah so they and they had so they had I'm not sure how many children they had. I mean I've got like all these cousins and yeah cousins once removed that I've never met. In fact I don't have any cousins uh you know because my dad just had one sister and she's unmarried.

So yeah and well so their children one of their sons is Rod Buckley and I just found out a few weeks ago because someone posted something on the Facebook group that he's actually a director of that favourite charity of ours the RRT.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=782s)

Yes yeah I think he's their main yeah he's the spokesperson person ever, yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=788s)

So yeah, that's my first cousin.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=789s)

Wow, you've got famous relatives.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=792s)

I mean, he'd be my brother's age, so I guess 12 or so years. Maybe a bit more older than me.

But the funny thing was about that, the connection toEndbach, is that they had a daughter called Julie and she escaped when she was 16\. She basically literally ran away with the clothes she was wearing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=820s)

A Buckley you were talking about.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=823s)

Yeah, Julie Buckley. I think she'd formed a relationship with a guy through work and then they found out and they called the priests and they basically chased her and she basically just ran out of the house with the clothes she was wearing and that was it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=845s)

So do you know what year that was?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=847s)

Well, that would have been in the 80s, late 80s, I imagine, because I think she's about my brother's age. So if she was 16, then I'm guessing I was around 86 or something.

Ben, I'm not sure. But so then she made contact with my dad, my dad a month, probably in the 90s. I don't actually know the date but it was sometime in the 90s after she'd kind of married this guy who was Ex-Salvation Army.

And then through that we got later she got hold of some photos of all her you know all her family and and then my mum's younger and my mum's brother Stephen Ward and all his family he had a massive brood.

And yeah and so we had all these photos and it was just like I was so weird you know and it's such a strange feeling of yeah just kind of regret and longing almost seeing these photos of my cousins and just knowing that there's no chance of seeing them you know.

And it's it's been made worse by the fact that now we've got children and, you know, Nadia's sister, they've got five kids and, you know, they've now moved to Germany. And when we go over there, you know, they're just so close. They're like, it's almost as close as brother and sister. And you just think, you know, we've just missed out so much because of brethren.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=953s)

Yeah, and the crazy thing is you're all brethren anyway. It's not like they're you know worldly it's just the difference in opinion between different groups of brethren which is it's so I was going to say juvenile I don't know what other word is for it but how pathetic the whole thing is how sad it is.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=976s)

The hilarious thing was that at that time when we got these photos that was around 2001\.

I think I'd started, well, it wasn't really going out with Nadia because she lived in Germany. It was a long distance relationship.

But we realized that two of Julie's brothers married girls from Bad Endbach.

They weren't related to Nadia. But yeah, I'm just like, really? That's just so crazy. Yeah, so I think Rod married a Shreiner, and then I think Glenn married a Brusius from Bad Endbach too so yeah uh really crazy and anyway so that was that.

So I've kind of gone yeah we've done my parents um and all the cousins I've never known.

So yeah and well what I didn't what I didn't say about Rentons was that basically they so they they kind of got rid of lots of the uh craziness that came in during the 1960s that was introduced by JTJr but they they still wanted to sort of hold on to some of the separation stuff. And then there were others that wanted to go further and [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1071s) rid of that as well. And particularly, I think the issue was professional associations and being a member of a professional body.

And that was the kind of issue that caused the division in 1972\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1085s)

Wow. So the professional associations thing, that was 1969\. So there were two crises. 69 was getting out of associations. Sorry, 59\. 59 was getting out of associations.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1100s)

Yeah, that was with Gerald Cowell.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1101s)

Which was kind of the start of the very early stage of the really crazy stuff. And then of course, 70 was the whole deal about Madeleine Ker and all that. So your group was kind of threw out 70 but kept 59\. And then the group that split off wanted to go beyond 59 and be free to join.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1122s)

Be free.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1125s)

And, of course, the crazy thing is that PBCC, they're now happily joining professional associations.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1134s)

Really?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1134s)

Yeah. So that all went out the window. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, you look on their LinkedIn and their members of chartered accountants and this or that business organization, yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1145s)

Presumably just because that gives them...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1134s)

Money exactly.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1149s)

Yeah you got to keep up with the Lord because he keeps turning those corners.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1156s)

Our famous rotary deity oh yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1160s)

So you left the Rentons then, you just recently left the Rentons is that what you're saying in 2018?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1167s)

2017 yeah so um six years coming well six and a half.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1173s)

And so is it I mean, you've heard a lot of the stories of the PBCC and all of us ex-leavers. Is it very similar? Walk us through what that was like just so that the leavers of PBCC can understand the similarities of leaving another group. I just want to interject here.

I'm familiar with the Rentons here in Calgary. And um like some of the feedback I get it was just of a recent funeral we won't get into all the details but of a recent funeral and the feedback I got from those ex-PBCC members that were at this Renton funeral how similar it was to the PBCC. I was in awe at what these stories were coming back at me. I had no clue. I mean I was very aware [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1226s) how strict the Rentons were here in Calgary. Um but the same similarities of having at this funeral instead of it being of the memories of the person that has just passed it more was about getting right and being part of the fellowship and it was this lecture and that's exactly what happens in the PBCC when someone passes away they're not sitting there talking about all the fond memories of the prison that just passed away it is usually a lecture on what this [means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1256s) to you and what we should be taken from it and you're wrong and this is wrong and you know.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1260s)

Yeah I mean I'd say to be fair not not always. I mean yeah so a funeral would a burial as they call it wouldn't call it a funeral. A burial meeting is basically a ministry meeting. So up to three people, three brothers can get up and give a word. I mean, yeah, it did vary. Sometimes you've got ones that are going to abuse it to ram home something. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1291s) I've been to ones like that.

But there were others that weren't so much like that. But you're right. There might have been a passing reference. I mean just a quick example where we were in West Norwood so that was in London. There was a lady there who was a GP before she got married.

So I don't quite know how that was allowed but maybe because she was a GP before 1970 I don't know. Anyway, and during, I went to that, to her burial, and I remember, you know, there was a sort of a kind of nod to her life and the contribution she had made in her capacity as a GP. But it was just literally a passing reference in the word.

And everything else is, oh, it's all got to be about the Lord and the Assembly and all the rest of it. And what the word is for us that remain and all the rest of it isn't it so…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1361s)

Yeah it's not a memorial service.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1363s)

No.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1364s)

No. In the Rentons did they say the same thing did they say that “The Lord took them?”

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1379s)

Yes definitely yeah. I mean isn't that kind of weird like why is he murdering people? No I don't think it's that they believe that, I suppose, that God's in control and you know he chooses the time um yeah it is an odd, it's a weird phrase.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1398s)

It's a brethrenism. We need to start a dictionary.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1400s)

I did that, that was one of the things that got me in trouble and actually yeah I was withdrawn from partially on the basis of something in that glossary of, what did I call it Brethrenese whatever it is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1417s)

We need to have a podcast just on this you know.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1422s)

I've said before that they bastardized the English language you know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1427s)

I mean we could actually could be a money spinner; “Learn Brethrenese in three weeks with these handy cassette tapes.”

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1435s)

Yeah, well, it was about the position. You would have heard the position. Oh, yes.

Another non-existent thing. The Rentons obviously had that as well. I mean, it wasn't made so much of, I would say, as probably you guys, but there was this quote from JT Senior, or in his ministry anyway, that said that “We must be governed by the light that governs the position.”

And I heard someone quote this and I just thought it's just so ridiculous and so I put in that glossary I put something about you know if the brethren were missionaries then presumably they'd be governed by the light that governs the missionary position.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1486s)

So that's what you got withdrawn from for.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1489s)

Well, it was that, and then one of the hymn, one of my parrot satirical hymns. You remember hymn 400?

God of the Universe. Oh, no, not God of the Universe. What is it?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1503s)

What hast thou wrought?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1505s)

No, no, it wasn't that one. It was the one that goes on about the Father's bosom, its own sphere, wherever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1511s)

Oh, yes, that one, yes.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1513s)

Secret intercourse holds sway.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1516s)

“Where holy love in all its secret intercourse holds sway.” It always seemed a little dodgy. Yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1521s)

I mean, I didn't think it was actually, there were quite a few, even Christians on the group who actually stood up for me and said, it's not blasphemous. It was just to kind of, I mean, because what I was saying was, it was basically trying to express the weird feeling that I got every time we sung that, because I knew that in the second verse, we would be singing these rude words. And it was just, it was a kind of a way of expressing that feeling that I had as a child, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1552s) would be singing about bosoms and intercourse, you know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1555s)

Particularly spherical bosoms.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1562s)

I mean…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1563s)

Okay, so let's get back to you leaving the Rentons and walk us through what that was like.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1567s)

Yeah, so that's, I mean, it was quite a long process, but it started around, well, Nadia's sister, I was actually just asking my brother-in-law recently when it actually happened. But they, so Nadia's sister married a Canadian and they they started questioning Brethren doctrine stuff around 2010-ish I think and they left in 2011 because they just they didn't get any satisfactory answers and in fact they actually had some really nasty sort [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1611s) emails and and communications particularly from one brother who said that you know if they left they'd be taking their family to hell and and they were heretical and stuff.

 Um that's probably familiar from from where you're coming from but, so they left and then in Endbach there were also some issues with a cousin of Nadia, and then that basically resulted in her cousin's family leaving and then shortly after her own parents and brother who was still living at home really left as well. Um so you know the family ties were beginning to weaken in that sense. But [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1663s) the same it wasn't just that, I mean we did, especially Nadia had had questions and concerns of herself about you know the nature of fellowship and um and and also baptism I mean you would have heard about household baptism I suppose?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1716s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1663s)

And we actually waterboarding for Jesus yeah I mean we looked into it. I mean we were we were still quite [earnest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1693s) at that time and then wanted you know wanted to do what what was sort of biblical and and so we actually looked into all the references we you know dug way deeper than probably most people would have and and we just really couldn't find any kind of positive evidence for it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1716s)

You mean infant baptism versus adult or believer's baptism?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1722s)

Yeah, I mean they don't call it infant baptism but it is baptism of infants in a household, isn't it?

And yeah, so that caused a bit of a ruckus. I mean, we had some heated discussions with our local brethren. So we were in Sunbury on Thames at that time.

It wasn't where we lived but that's where the meeting was.

And yeah and then it and that kind of although that wasn't made an issue or like we weren't you know they didn't say either you have to baptize him or that was our second we baptized the oldest.

They didn't say either you have to baptize him or we're going to withdraw from you but at the same time it was quite clear that they weren't happy with it and a kind of distance came in and it was almost as if we were being cold-shouldered and not being invited.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1779s)

So just trying to sort of imagine this, did your children, were they expected to break bread more or less from birth or?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1790s)

No so that is a big difference between the two so the baptism was obviously the same but the breaking of bread, so that was the thing that was introduced by JTJr I believe that yes, babies would or as soon as they could reach for the emblems they could break bread.

And no, so with us it was you had to ask ask for fellowship and right okay I mean some probably did quite young but it was probably more in the age of 12 on really.

I didn't until I was 16 I think which was pretty late. I know that's another thing I really struggled it it took a tremendous amount of psyching myself up to do that I just…[yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1846s) it was just so scary.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1848s)

Did you not go to Sunday morning meeting then is that how it went?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1852s)

Oh no you went but you just didn't, you know they just passed the bread and cut past you you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1860s)

I gotcha okay. Yeah so it's like a normal church like if you go to a church nowadays and if you're not a part of there you just don't go up and get the…I get you, okay.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1866s)

Yeah um you just it was just passed you know in front of you if you were sitting well wherever you were sitting, you didn't have to sit behind like the circle, because I mean they did that if someone wanted to come to the supper, you know, they would actually put out some chairs behind the two circles and make them sit there.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1889s)

So is it open to the public in that sense like could I go to a Renton Lord's supper?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1896s)

Yeah yeah you could and in that sense they are more much more open, they're fine with you coming to their meetings them going to anyone else's meetings is a completely different thing and that comes back to this thing about the position they think they are the ones you know, they are the ones that are so… they still have the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1918s)

Same belief as the PBCC where they feel that they are the chosen ones.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1925s)

Um well they wouldn't they wouldn't admit it in so many words but I you know they they think that they have the light and they're the most true to the light if you like, if you know what I mean and they're in the right place and yeah every other place has got some something wrong with it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1947s)

So how do they, so when you say you were kind of looking up about baptism, presumably you had all the ministry up to JT Senior, well how did that work or did they have their own ministry? What was the bookshelf?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1960s)

Yeah, we had all the ministry to JT Senior, I mean to be honest we didn't go into all of that ministry, it was more looking at the actual scriptures, the Bible itself, references in the New Testament and some of the kind of allegories in the altars and we had some discussions with other brethren as well.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1987s)

But did the Rentons have their own kind of publishing house or did they publish any ministry from their own meeting then?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=1998s)

Yes, so they had, I'm not too sure on the details of all the publishing but there was the Kingston Bible Trust, was that a PBCC thing?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2013s)

Yeah, so the Kingston Depot as they called it split in two I mean they basically had four trustees two left at Aberdeen and two stayed and so they legally split the whole printing works and everything in two.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2026s)

Yeah and I think it then split again in 72 too. So I think you did have a version of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2032s)

You had half a printing press and the alphabet as far as M.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2039s)

Yeah, so we had everything up to JT Senior. And I think actually there were some brethren that hung on to their JT Junior ministry. I know at least one brother that did that because he admitted it to me. And I was quite shocked when he said that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2055s)

But did they publish any, I mean so just going back to Renton and presumably Renton is a guy I mean it's named after a leader so did he have published ministry or?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2066s)

Jim Renton was from Edinburgh he's actually his first cousin of Robert Stott who was Roger's father.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2073s)

Right yeah who was a trustee of the depot.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2076s)

He was a trustee of the depot.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2080s)

I mean, was he also considered a Man of God with like a direct link to Jesus and stuff?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2085s)

No so that's the other thing where where the Renton’s are different so we we didn't have a uh a leader, one leader um like like uh Symington Hales etc. so it was a bit weird in that sense that there was no kind of over and supreme authority, and you didn't have to, you know, ring someone up to to ask for permission for things like getting married and stuff like that. It was [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2115s) more self-organised in a way. But there were leading brothers who gave three-day meetings and fellowship meetings and all the rest of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2130s)

But each congregation was kind of autonomous to a much larger degree. Interesting.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2137s)

Yeah.

It wasn't that all the meetings were independent though. Like the kind of Bethesda thing there was still kind of, if there was an issue in one place then the nearest meeting would could get involved I think. You need to speak to someone older to get into all the actual nitty gritty of that.

But there were some that did try to interfere so there were some brethren that left or kicked out rather kicked out of the PBCC like Will McKillop from Chicago originally.

And yeah he's passed now I don't know who else and they did cause trouble they did try and interfere and pretend they were some kind of universal priesthood.

So that they would try to throw their weight around because well, I guess they missed it they missed being able to do that in the PBCC but.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2208s)

You didn't come across a guy called Roland Smith, did you?

Because he left the Brethren and joined up with some other maybe he was on the other side of your split and he went around taking three day meetings outside the PBCC in some branch of the Brethren and then he came back in.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2231s)

Right no I haven't heard that name no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2234s)

I think one of the reasons why I was really intrigued in bringing um you know people on from the other branches is that there's a lot of heat that's happening inside the PBCC there's a lot of things that is happening inside there a lot of people leaving, a lot of people, so many people with one foot in one foot out and to me that these other offsprings and offshoots that happened after [Aberdeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2265s) I'm curious as to like what rules had been let go, what was still there, what would happen if the PBCC had a big downfall and a lot of these little groups started growing again. In your opinion with what you experienced in theRentons or what you know about the Rentons what do you think is still a downfall within these other offspring groups such as the Rentons that you were in?

Like what were what are some of the things that you still didn't agree with that were still too indoctrinated still too cult-like still too uh this isn't right.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2307s)

Um well in terms of practices I mean there's a there's a quite a few things that we weren't allowed to do although you have to say you know mileage varies it did according to where you were you know. Some some places were more liberal than others but I mean we weren't allowed TV or radio although uh [bizarrely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2337s) when the internet came along that was okay and computers and all that.

I mean I suppose you know in the early days the internet things you know dial up connections and that you couldn't stream TV and and Netflix didn't exist and that kind of stuff so it was I suppose you could argue it was it was it was more sort of educational resource in the beginning [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2368s) it sort of slipped in like that um but still you know even now now you can watch anything on, you know stream anything yeah as far as I know there's no rule about having it.

So yeah it's very hypocritical in that sense um other things I mean in terms of education um Obviously, the professional association thing, as far as I know, still holds. Although, I have to say, there has been a split since we left.

And I mean, one of the issues there was another one of the reasons that we left anyway.

And so my parents are now on the sort of more liberal side and my brother is on the other side. So our family is like completely fractured.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2432s)

Do they go to church every day as well?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2435s)

No so that's another thing so then so the meetings themselves probably quite similar in terms of the format and uh although there wouldn't obviously be any references to Bruce Hales or or all the great men that lived since um JT Senior but it'd be very much you know quoting JT Senior often and all that preceding ministry, but in terms of frequency we didn't, another thing we didn't have a 6 a.m [supper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2466s) it was 9 a.m usually um or even 10 in some places.

Um and then it would be a reading and a preaching so three meetings I mean that's still way too much and still way way more than a mainstream church uh would have but…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2484s)

Did the men still have the authority over the females or was it more equal like could a female stand up and give a preaching?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2494s)

No no so that would be exactly the same so only men are allowed to take part in fact and I've made this point on the on the Ex-PB group in that sense because with Renton's sisters aren't allowed to give out hymns because that was one of the rules that was introduced in the 60s, in that sense the PBCC are actually more liberal on that point.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2521s)

So they're really gagged.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2522s)

So do the women have any role in the Rentons? Do they have any role that they do?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2529s)

No official, no official uh you know no role in the meeting apart from singing, obviously they can sing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2540s)

Are they are they expected to be submissive to the husbands?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2543s)

Yeah I mean in practice not always but yeah that's the teaching isn't it I mean it's that's what they would if you ask them that's what they would say you know based on Corinthians isn't it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2560s)

So what about, do they wear hats or headscarves because that was another Jim Taylor thing was the headscarves.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2567s)

So no it's hats and yeah boy Julia will be able to tell you about the hats I mean it's basically like Royal Ascot on a Sunday morning.

Some of the hats especially like a three day meeting, everyone bought new outfits, all the women bought new outfits.

Men maybe not because they just wore suits and dress well ,we wore suits and ties, so ties were back with Rensons even though they're banned with us.

So, yeah, it was quite dressy, especially on the Lord's Day. During the week, not so much, but you still be expected to wear something smart, not just rock up in jeans and a t-shirt.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2616s)

What about university? Were you allowed university?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2620s)

Yeah, so that's another thing. So, I was allowed, well, and that again varies.

My sisters weren't allowed to go to university, although my younger sister, not younger than me, but the younger of my sisters, she rebelled and basically left home at 18 and went to university.

So they both left Brethren, actually, in their teens.

And, yeah, I mean, that wasn't the only reason. They left there were other things but yeah one of the that would have been one of the main factors was the the sort of the subservient role that they were supposed to have, but yeah it was okay for for guys to go to university although there was uh there were certain things it just wasn't worth studying because of the rule about professional associations. So it wasn't really important studying law, medicine, [dentistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2684s), veterinary science, um architecture even some engineering I mean you can you can do engineering and not be chartered I think but it's it's unusual.

Yeah so there were a lot of things that were off limits um but you know in that sense I'm grateful I was allowed to go to university although that's by that point you know [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2716s) sort of become so, this sort of separation thing had become so kind of ingrained that you know I traveled up to London, I went to Imperial College um because we lived in Camberley at the time there was a coach that went up basically almost passed off our house and all the way up to Victoria station so and it stopped stopped at the Royal Albert Hall, which is just right next to Imperial.

But I basically went up every day and I had very, very little contact with other people there. I didn't join any societies and I didn't really have any proper friends. I just kept myself to myself. I used to sit next to a Hindu guy who was kind of similar in that he had a twin brother there, but they didn't really mix with with anyone else in the university either because of I think religious reasons. And yeah just such a waste of four years, utter waste. I never even went into the Royal Albert Hall for a concert. I'm just saying to Nadia the other day what an utter waste.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2788s)

When you guys leave, when someone decides to leave is there the huge separation rule, well then those people aren't allowed to associate with…like are people allowed that are still in the Rentons are they allowed to associate with you once you leave?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2804s)

Well to an extent I mean it's not as the shunning is…there's not the shunning like you got with the PBCC so you can you can still have social contacts, but there is there is a distance and it's just I think partly because you just don't have anything much in common anymore um you know and and then also just the busyness of peeb life you know, they're always going off to the meetings [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2834s) Saturdays and Sundays and um they just they prioritize that over any anything else so it's difficult to sometimes even you know uh meet up with them for that reason.

But yeah it is different in that sense that you can still have contact, but in terms of marriage that's out of the question and that was the issue that I was talking about earlier that one of the things that led to us leaving was someone in Australia married a girl that had been withdrawn from in the UK.

And that was seen not to be a marriage in the Lord even though 99.99% of yeah anyway it was just ridiculous but so.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2894s)

Do they have any coloured Renton brethren or is it strictly a whites only group?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2903s)

It's not if there aren't it's not because, I'm trying to remember if there are or not no there are yeah there was some that actually came from one of the other groups that split subsequently I think it might have been a Frost group or some there was definitely someone from Jamaica.

And in India yeah we had some brethren in India.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2934s)

Yeah so what countries are Renton groups in? What's their global reach?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=2942s)

Now you're testing me. So yeah, the main lot are in the UK. There's a handful in the States and Canada.

And then there's a handful on the continent, continental Europe.

There's even fewer in Australia.

There were some in New Zealand but I don't think there are any more. I think there was some kind of division there and they left.

Where else, yes then India.

There were some that actually joined while we were, probably after we got married I think so since 2005\.

So you've probably heard of the Desais. So there was that family there in Mumbai. I think that was Mumbai.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3003s)

But then... Romulus Desai, he joined the Rentons, did he?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3007s)

No, it was Remus that was with the Rentons, I think.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3011s)

Oh, okay. Was his twin brother, no doubt.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3015s)

Yeah.

But then there were some others that came in in Andhra Pradesh, I think. I'm not quite sure how how we got into contact with them all but they joined and I'm not quite sure what their motives were. I mean I think we sent them quite a lot of money um so yeah that always helps doesn't it but yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3039s)

Is there an application form? How do I sign up?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3045s)

Do a lot of young people leave in the Rentons as well like in the PBCC?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3049s)

Um I don't know what the rate of attrition is, but yeah, from time to time there were those that left, but it is more relaxed. And I think especially as time goes on, I think things are probably getting, you know, more liberal and less, perhaps informally anyway, less legal than they were back in the day. But in some ways a lot of the young people are kind of just as worldly as people outside like especially in Scotland.

I remember you know they had wild parties and all sorts and um yeah you just you just wonder why they're why they stay really I suppose it's family and family yeah finance and friends.

Yeah finance is not such an issue because that's another thing I was going to say so in terms of employment most Rentons don't have their own business, there are some that do, but most would work for a worldly employer.

And so there's not that kind of being tied into the brethren ecosystem of finance and mortgages and all the rest of it um which does make it does make it easier to leave.

I mean yeah I had my job I kept it and we had a mortgage with Nationwide I think um so you know it there wasn't that kind of those tendrils that were sort of holding, holding us in.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3158s)

Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3160s)

Now that you've left the Rentons I mean it's been how many years now looking back on it. What I want to just differentiate, my whole goal that keeps going through my head here is that if the PBCC were to split, I'm going back to this again, that I I would assume that there would be groups like this starting to form, and so I just want to give perspective to the insiders of the PBCC [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3190s) from somebody who wasn't in something as strict as the PBCC, in some ways more strict than others, I mean if the the women weren't even allowed to give out hymns I mean that's that's pretty gagged, but we're looking back on what you've experienced your life as now back to the Rentons and what the PBCC have gone through. In the Rentons what do you think still would need,what freedom do you enjoy now that you never had inside the Rentons?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3216s)

So well we've we've touched on you know I mean careers wise yeah you know now we're just, our kids can basically do anything they want, the sky's the limit really for them there's no kind of… 

I mean so the other thing I hadn't said is you know political involvement in any politics would have been a no-no as well even though that wouldn't have necessarily needed an involvement in an association.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3247s)

No.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3249s)

We didn't vote, well some may have done but it officially it wasn't done so yeah I mean so careers wise anything and I mean the whole the whole meeting thing is just it's still real. I was just talking to Nadia this morning about how it was bringing up children you know and trying to control them because [obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3280s) you know that that fell to her. I didn't have when the boys were little, I didn't have them with me on the front row, it was her, she had to deal with it all and they were utter monkeys you know they just wouldn't stay still. It was a complete exercise in keeping them quiet and keeping them in one place.

And no creche, there's no support, no kind of help from other, even other sisters or whatever.

It was just you just had to manage and you were expected to make your kids sit there and behave and frown on if they played up and expected to take them out if they kicked off.

So compare that to a mainstream church where you've got a creche, you've got youth groups where the kids can go, where they're with people the same age and where there's relevant content and stuff that they can understand.

This is just a completely different world.

So there's yeah if you're thinking, I mean I think what some people have done is they've left the PBCC or Jims as we used to call them and maybe joined Rentons because it's a kind of it's a halfway house. It's it's less of a culture shock to kind of go there and maybe that is the way to go even if it's only a short-term thing. But I think as you leave, you kind of gain... It's not until you leave properly that you really gain perspective and actually you stand back and you think, oh my goodness, what were we involved in? 

And the other point I was going to make was that all through my upbringing, you know, my parents, they would always be talking about Aberdeen, not specifically about what happened. I mean, they didn't talk about that. I didn't find out until I read on on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3409s) internet on peebs was it peebs.net and the old website that's where I found out what happened um they wouldn't talk about that but obviously they were talking about the event because it was such a big part of their lives and they lost my mom lost all her family um and they lost loads of friends as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3428s)

That was the point I wanted to make. I wanted to make that point of that if there are people that are leaving and they're thinking of all these other groups that are set up I really wanted to have you on here to articulate that you've now left the Rentons and this is the clarity that you've gained from even being in the Rentons or what all.

 I mean I'm sure a lot of them are very similar um yeah it's because it's not, I understand it could be like this halfway house but I just wanted to be able to [bring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3458s) someone from the Rentons on and open up the Rentons because it is a group that is very similar to the PBCC, a lot of Ex-PBCC members talk to Rentons they're friends with Rentons so I think it's important to be able to have these those of you that have been in the Rentons that are maybe out or um experience what the Rentons were to be able to explain to those that maybe this isn't what they want either.

 I really just wanted these options out there for these leavers that if this split does happen or [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3488s) this this downfall happens that they know what their options are because a lot of people don't know what the Rentons are I didn't know what they were not until that I until I heard the report back from this funeral that happened uh recently where I was just shocked absolutely shocked at how similar they were to the PBCC.

So my whole my whole point in this is that if you're looking for structure that is less than the PBCC then maybe [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3519s) groups are them but if you are looking for to find who you are to give your kids pure freedom to allow them to just be who they are and parents that need to be who they are then step out without anything and find your own faith inner faith on your own.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3538s)

I mean if you're really into hats it sounds like paradise yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3543s)

Fashion shows yeah\! What does leaving Renton brethren meant for us? It means we can follow our dreams and our children can study what they want and be what they want, the sky's the limit. It means the weight of expectation and conformity has gone we don't have to attend meetings, we don't have to dress in a certain way we don't have to constantly self-censor, it means we're free from the indoctrination of a separatist sect that teaches biblical [literalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3574s) that conflicts with both biblical scholarship and science.

It means we have the freedom to watch and listen to what we want, to go where we want, to think what we want.

It means we can go away for the weekend or on holiday and generally plan our lives without having to fit around meetings and places where there are meetings. And it means we can make friends with anyone, belong to clubs, societies, music ensembles and so on, and generally experience the full range of human diversity, creativity and emotion, living in colour instead of monochrome.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3610s)

One thing I'm really curious about is, one of the fundamental things that the PBCC, or rather the Plymouth Brethren in JND's time was founded on, is the idea that it's non-denominational, and that to call yourself the Methodists or the Church of England was completely wrong because it denies the existence of the one church, the one true church. Did the Rentons give themselves any name or were they always, oh, we're just simple Christians?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3644s)

No, it was that. Yeah, they didn't like having a label.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3650s)

They didn't call themselves the Rentons. That was purely an external name.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3654s)

That's a name that I've only you know in recent years come to realise that that's what we were called. What I was going to say, it's come back to me now, the thing that made the fact that my parents had left the Jims or left the PBCC and they were always talking about how bad and how awful it was and how awful they were and it was almost as if that we had that sort of bad guy, that bad example of this awful church in the background that it kind of made us look normal.

And we thought you know genuinely I knew there were some idiosyncrasies about brethren and the things they did but you know oh well compared to the Jims, you know, we were pretty much... We're normal. We're much better, yeah. ...weren't we? And then it was only, as I said, only since leaving and gaining perspective and actually... And the other thing is, you know, they don't go to any other churches, but they say, you know, we're the [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3731s) ones that have got the light, this light and that light. But how do they know?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3737s)

Because they don't go to other churches. They don't go anywhere.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3740s)

Don't interact with other Christians.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3741s)

Well they might find out if they did but…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3743s)

What I find funny is the the Rentons talked about the PBCC you know the bad, at least we're not like them you know but what I find interesting is that the PBCC never talked about the Rentons or at least growing up ever, and I wonder if that's because how would they describe them, they're the funner version of us, they have less rules, you know what I mean it would be terrible advertising so the PBCC can never [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3773s) about the Rentons but at least the Rentons could turn and go, hey look at least we're not as bad as these guys yeah, that's funny.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3781s)

The funny thing is in the PBCC the bad guys were always the open brethren. I mean you would be saying yeah open brethren you know open brethren they're the dirtiest ditch in Christendom I think that was JT Jr, and so there was always this kind of other bunch, you know, the kind of the wicked relatives, the Midianites, the ones who had turned away, and they were always held up as, you know, this is what, if you leave the brethren, this is the depth you will sink to, open [brethrenism,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3811s) you know, the worst thing you could say, it sort of sounds like that was the way the Rentons talked about the Jims, that they were, you know, this is what happens if you leave the good path, you become this evil you know, it's just so interesting that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3826s)

All of them seem to have the light, they're all the chosen ones yeah yeah it's like a Mexican standoff everyone's pointing their guns.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3839s)

It's all these pots and kettles all calling each other black isn't it I mean.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3844s)

Yeah go on Paul what were you gonna say.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3846s)

No I was just gonna just, because obviously there's um and Nadia and I took a slightly different path to each other. I mean, obviously, we're still together. We're still married. We still love each other.

But as part of all that sort of turmoil when we left, somewhere along the way, I just started to doubt the whole thing. And I just started to think, is any of this actually right? And one of the things that played into that was my sister, so as I said I had two sisters both of them so left in their teens and the older [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3892s) them she got married and had two children and two girls and the the younger one got this really rare ear cancer um yeah and you know everyone even brethren actually the brethren we were with prayed for her because they obviously knew Claire when she was still in brethren, they and [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3922s) was prayed for a lot um and but yeah she died um age four.

And what is something I'll regret for the rest of my life is that we didn't go to the funeral because it was a Church of England service.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3942s)

Wow.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3944s)

I mean we did actually go to the graveyard and as it happened I think it's because they knew that we couldn't go or wouldn't go they actually put it on a loudspeaker, they put a big loudspeaker outside the church you know put the service on that so we were standing out there and we did we did hear some of it but you know that that that's how that's how legalistic the Renton brethren are.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=3974s)

Wow and we were like the whole basis of why we won't do those things or or whatever is because it's a programming in the mind when we're children of a fear of doing the wrong thing, right? And doing anything that they tell us is wrong has these dire consequences after your life, in the afterlife, apparently, right? So it's fear. It all comes from a fear. And it [takes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4004s) years to get over those fears, or at least it did for me.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4010s)

Yeah, and it was a slow process. It does take oh it's so much it's so deep inside isn't it the the the sort of indoctrination and it did take a long time to actually admit that I didn't believe anymore um and and to say it out loud it was just so strange. Yeah so it was that you know just the problem of pain the problem of suffering, [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4041s) would God let a four-year-old girl were they…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4046s)

Inside there too did they believe that when something like that happened that it was you know, God speaking to you that you know, everybody needs to look at themselves and make sure that you know you're…

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4061s)

There were definitely some who thought that in fact I know there was one brother who's sort of my sister's age who wrote her a very nasty letter along those lines. You know, this is God speaking to you because of the error of your ways sort of thing, basically.

It's just terrible, isn't it? It is. That's really what you need just when your child has died. I mean, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4093s)

No creator of the universe that can make galaxies that go on forever does that, right? If there is a creator, I'm sorry, doesn't put children through pain and suffering and parents through that. I just personally can't believe in that, right? That's what took some of my faith away after, right? How can suffering go on like this and be warranted? And apparently someone's fault, right? Like like that mindset [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4124s) someone did something wrong that's why this terrible thing happened is again it's one of those programming things that um these religious sects they do right? They say if bad things happen someone did something wrong right? And it's not like that and it's a terrible way to think in my opinion.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4143s)

Yeah it's been a it's been a streak through not just brethren but other conservative Christian circles for years and years this sort of concept of if something bad happens you're being punished for it but yeah when it happens like that it's just hard to understand isn't it? But yeah I mean so even though obviously [Nadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4173s) still believes and I respect her for that but I'm not not one of these sort of rabid atheists.

It's been interesting journey just to find for example you know evolution and geology and satisfying intellectual explanations for why we're here and that kind of thing and opening your mind to that because that was one of the things that okay brethren might not be young earth creationists per se but they they didn't really believe in evolution um they might not have said as much but I don't think they did.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4217s)

And did they believe in a literal Adam and Eve six thousand years ago and Noah'sark and all that that was definitely all literal.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4224s)

Yeah well I posted just recently on the group that you set up Lane about Noah's ark didn't I about the fact that yeah there's there's stories going back hundreds of years before that in different cultures but they're almost identical to the to that story yeah so you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4249s)

And I think it's okay, I think it's really especially for the insiders and I mean I know since Lane uh started his group right that there's probably a lot of controversy around it and I know that you've you know gone through what you've gone through Lane after setting it up.

 I think it's important to question, especially people who have had a lot of trauma. Like for myself, I question everything, right? When you go through the shit some of us [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4279s) through, you have to question. There's no way but to question things. And I think it's important to question things. I think questioning things should be what everybody in this world does. We all should question things because when you question things you come back to \- what do I believe? What sits with me? And if every freaking human being on this planet could come back to themself what a different world we would have. We wouldn't have the world we have because everyone's sitting [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4311s) what they believe versus what's being told to them versus what's being um indoctrinated into them right? We all need to learn how to think for ourselves, so I do I think that the group you set up Lane was very good because it gives people um a platform that are either full-blown atheists or people who are questioning or people who just need to have this opportunity to be able to work through what they're thinking and feeling.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4338s)

And I mean the thing I think is that if something is true if you question it and people question it and try and pick holes in it, if it's true it gets stronger and stronger, it gets reinforced by that process. If it's false, when people start questioning it starts to crumble away and weaken. So if what the brethren believe is true, they shouldn't be concerned about questioning, they should welcome questioning because if it's true, the [questioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4368s) will result in strengthening what they have. If you come across something and people say, oh, you mustn't question that, you mustn't ask about that, you can guarantee that it's wrong. Because otherwise they wouldn't need to defend it. I mean, even in the Brethren, they used to say the truth defends itself, but they don't actually believe it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4388s)

Because you're not allowed to question it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4387s)

 I like the saying try and think like a scientist and not a lawyer. A lawyer has his conclusion right, that's like the person that says I believe this and then they go and they find all the evidence that supports that belief. The scientist goes I know nothing I'm just gonna look and follow it and go where it goes. 

To stay curious, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4417s)

Yeah yeah um one of the questions I wanted to ask you Paul was it so in the PBCC obviously um there's a lot of abuse there's a lot of alcoholism there's a lot of things that go on. In your experience with the Rentons do you find like, do they suffer from a lot of alcoholism, do you know if there's a lot of like, spousal abuse, like what do you know about that?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4442s)

Alcohol is definitely consumed.

I don't think it's nearly as much of a problem as in the PBCC. I mean I was so shocked when someone told us about these whiskey breaks that they have and just drinking whiskey in the meeting and stuff like that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4464s)

That was Jim Taylor wasn't it so that would be one of the things that didn't get transmitted.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4471s)

But there are for sure there are some even some ministering brothers that probably do drink heavily.

But it's I would say more the exception than the rule.

But yeah I mean it's often if you have people around the other thing I wanted to say just in passing by the way because it sounds like I'm and perhaps we all are criticising, nothing else, and finding nothing positive. But one of the positives that I do say is the hospitality of the brethren and just the warmth with which they had people around and had you in their homes and that sense of community. I think Julia's said that before.

And that's something that you do miss when you leave because it's all there ready for you on a plate, the community and from birth and everyone knows you.

Especially within the Rentons where there's so many fewer brethren.

So yeah there is that but obviously there's lots of downsides as well so yeah but yeah so going back to the the alcohol thing I think, I wouldn't have said it's nearly as much of a problem and as far as spousal abuse goes I don't know there may be some cases but um I again I don't know it's not the sort of thing that [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4580s) have would have really come out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4582s)

Yeah well I mean we welcome on, we welcome any anyone can come on here and do a podcast we welcome any Rentons that want to come on or ex-Rentons that want to come on and dive into this. I think it's really important I think this is a very very important movement on all angles not just the PPCC um this has been something that I've wanted to do for a while just because I know that they're, you know, when people do leave, especially if it's families with children or people who want to keep their Christian faith, they do look for those other groups that are very much, very similar to the PBCC, right? 

And I think it's important to be able to give them the picture, what it looks like, what it looked like for you, what you enjoyed in there, what you were relieved of when you left what the separation is like what the I mean I'm assuming they have still the same eating [eating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4639s) rule that do they keep the whole eating rule there?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4642s)

Well that was a funny one because you you were you were allowed to eat with people who weren't in fellowship but unless it was a wedding uh if unless it was a meeting a wedding reception um go figure I mean yeah you weren't allowed to invite people that weren't in fellowship to a wedding reception.

And so we ended up having because obviously my sisters were out when we got married.

And so, well, my the younger of them didn't actually come. And the reason she didn't come was because she was unmarried. And we wouldn't invite her boyfriend because they were unmarried.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4582s)

And she was like, you know, living in sin, we've been together for 10 years.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4642s)

Yeah, exactly. We've been together for 10 years. I'm not coming without him. And that was fair play, absolutely right.

And so she didn't come. And then my other sister, she was married and had a little one at the time and they came over to Germany because obviously the wedding was in Endbach.

And we arranged it, we had a marriage over two days in order to have this arrangement where we had the registry office on the Friday and then we had this family meal after that.

So they came to that because it was a family meal which was just like you know extended family and then on the Saturday we had the the marriage meeting and then like a meal after that meeting which was just a kind of the sort of meal you'd have…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4760s)

Which was just brethren Renton brethren in good standing and no one else.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4765s)

No no well they were you see, that's the weird thing, they were allowed to stay for that moment it wasn't it wasn't a formal wedding reception, wedding breakfast or what you call it in the US but um yeah oh just weird, it's just so hypocritical isn't it it's yeah um.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4784s)

What do you think when you see what's going down right now and when you watch everything that's happening on all the social media like what are your thoughts on?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4794s)

What with the PBCC yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4797s)

Yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4798s)

Um yeah I mean I think it's great all the exposure that's happening and uh you know I mean there was that thing with the the churchyard wasn't there in the in the United States and you did a great job at exposing that Richard didn't you, and and the thing in, was it Chicago with that meeting, that development um uh you know and all these podcasts you're doing it's definitely gathering momentum isn't it in terms of [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4828s) know exposing them for who they are and actually waking people up to see you know, see what they really are and smell the coffee yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4840s)

And I think I do I just think it's just so important to be able to come to the table and let people get off their chest what they need to get off their chest. Because so many people inside relate, right? That's how this movement is happening. People are relating to the people who are coming on here. And I was just so grateful that you agreed to coming on and just give us a little inside look into what your Renton life looked like. And, you know, the freedom that you've even experienced since leaving the Renton. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4876s) I really appreciate that. Thank you so much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4879s)

Yeah, and it's so fascinating. It's like Alice through the looking glass. It's like a window into this parallel universe. And the thing that kind of struck me is the way that the kind of the shadow of Aberdeen hung over you, just the same as it hung over us. Because I was born in 71\. And, you know, right from your earliest memory, there was this Aberdeen word, which you didn't know what it meant. But it always had this huge, dark [significance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4909s) to it. And it really kind of hung over everything. And, you know, you're the ones who went the other way at Aberdeen, but it was still like this huge black shadow in the history that everyone was looking over their shoulders at.

It's just absolutely fascinating to kind of discover this whole other universe.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4928s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4931s)

Yeah.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4932s)

Yeah I mean it it's so scarred the psyches of of everyone at that time I think I don't know if I actually mentioned my my mom so they got married in 1969 yeah um and she fell pregnant with my brother uh pretty much straight away and and then July 1970, bam, she just lost all her family and I think she may have lost her father [soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4962s) after that as well, I mean he died and then I don't think they were allowed to go to the burial or anything and yeah and it's just all of that stuff.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=4971s)

I mean my grandmother was from Scotland and she literally lost every single member of her family like her brothers her brothers and sisters and her cousins and like you know it's a huge extended family and overnight she was the only one left and it left this pain. I mean, I knew her very well because I cared for them, my grandparents, towards the end of their lives, but there was this whole black hole [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5001s) the family had been. I mean, it's almost like Holocaust survivors. It affects their psyche and it ruined their lives.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5011s)

And it's also I mean others have made the point that it's it's it's almost worse than than actually losing people you know through death, it's absolutely they are the living dead and yeah it's yeah there's no closure at all is there, isn't it, like if someone dies eventually well I don't know I've not really experienced it much personally but you know people say grief is different get closure from and you grieve and you get some kind of closure from it over time but with that you don't [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5041s) you know they're still there and…

And also even worse if you are a you know a real believer you actually think all those people are going to spend eternity in hell while you're enjoying yourself in heaven and they think the same about you and when you kind of look at it like that it you know it's it's it's just terrible it's…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5064s)

Did your mom struggle like after when you were growing up, did your mom struggle with the, like how did she cope with the loss of all her family?

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5072s)

To be honest I think she just bottled it up she didn't speak about it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5079s)

Oh that's sad.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5080s)

Um yeah and that and there was another post recently about emotions and um yeah well it was about emotions wasn't it and in the brethren and I can say that that was very similar to the Renton's as well in terms of you know it wasn't the thing to express your emotions to show strong emotions and stiff upper lip just get on with it, deal with it.

It's the Lord's will, whatever you know, this kind of stoicism and just denial of just natural processes and emotions. It's it's just not healthy, it's quite toxic actually I think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5127s)

That's why this is so important why we need to learn how to question things. If we went back to the the whole Aberdeen split, when that all happened and everybody's families were split and um like if if we are learning, and I'm saying you can still be a, you can still be of the Christian faith and question things you can still be of any kind religion and still question things, had the people that really chose like [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5157s) PBCC side of things and were like stuck with JTJr and stuck with the lies, stuck with all that, had they been thinking for themselves they would have been able to have this broad overview look of this rule of separation that was literally such a stark catastrophic holocaust split that happened in there that literally, in my opinion, started all of this generational trauma that we all are experiencing now right?

Had people been questioning for [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5188s), been thinking for themselves I don't think we would be in the situation that we are in today on multiple levels but on the main broad level is this, it is the questioning of the separation, the question if you thought for yourself and watched what was happening, had they been thinking for themselves things might have been different.

Yeah and it just it breaks my heart it breaks my heart to hear the stories from way back to just listening to what your mother… like [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5218s) just so sad that this generational trauma just keeps getting handed down, handed down, handed down until yes we've got a movement like this now and that's where my heart lays.

 I may come across very passionate on this podcast but I want to remind people that this passion comes from \- I want to stop this. We need to learn how to stop this. We need to learn how to bring people together whether it's of different faiths, whether it's a different beliefs, whether, to me there [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5249s) to be a way that everybody can come together for a common goal no matter what a person thinks.

 I believe that that is possible, I really do but the one thing that you have to be willing to give up is you have to be willing to give up indoctrination from society, from religion ,from schooling, whatever that may be you've got to be able to pull up that mirror in front of yourself and actually ask yourself what do I believe? What do I believe? [What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5279s) do I, look out in the world and it's like what do I want to change? What do we want changed and what does that change consist of, what can that look like, how do we come together to have that change? 

I am again, I know I said it before, I'm just so grateful Paul that you came on we're able to start opening up this can of…I'm looking inside the Rentons on a different side of things I know there's other people that have contacted me and I'm really looking forward I'm so looking forward to [giving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5310s) people a little look inside the Renton life and how similar it is to the PBCC, areas that it's different and allowing those insiders that if they're thinking of leaving that you know, the different options and what you really need to start thinking about what it is that you want to create if you do leave.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5331s)

Yeah and definitely gets more on because obviously I've only got my own perspective yes or my experience from a certain geographical location and I'm sure there's things I've forgotten and things I'll think in 10 minutes time, oh I can't believe I didn't mention that you know, you definitely need to get a nice rounded view from…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5354s)

And that's what we're looking for and I mean that's why we have 78 podcasts right, is because everybody gives a different piece of it and often the people that are going to relate to you now can email you and they'll relate to something that you said right? This is how we create this community of healing, community of change, community of possibilities um no matter what you believe or how each of us are in our personality. So for me your [name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5384s) stood out to me on social media through your humor of your poetry and your writings. I mean, you need to write a book. It would, it's, it's, it, for those days when we're on the floor in fetal position crying, I would totally pick up Paul's book and read it to me.

I mean, if you haven't started one yet, you really should start one. And if nobody's checked it out, like just Google Paul's name and in social media, and you'll, you'll find his posts are hilarious. Stay tuned at the end of this podcast for one of Paul's writings on freedom.

There is also a link in the description to a selection of his inspirational poetry.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5424s)

So thank you for bringing some light and humor to a lot of our social media and for coming on. Thank you so much.

### [**Paul Flowerdew**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5436s)

And to be honest, it was, it's been really cathartic for me to be able to do that as well. Just, you know, the satirical stuff. Initially after we left was just that was a release for me just to get yeah get that out of my system and yeah just and bring some sunshine ,laughter to to other people that have kind of been in the same horrible situation.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHpsOZNvbQM&t=5457s)

Yeah and we do we need that with the pain that we have we also need to you know, find those pockets of joy and humor at the same time and I mean your humor did it for me\!

Freedom

*Tis the truest joy and blessing to be free from brethren now.*  
*To have no big brother watching what we do and don't allow.*

*We can go to other churches, or can go to none at all.*   
*Without fear or retribution, nothing can us now befall.*

*We can study any subject, we can dream without regret,*  
*And our children's full potential is no longer under threat.*

*Now it's time to forge new friendships, with whoever we can choose.*  
 *No more keeping folk at arm's length, if they're holding different views.*

*We the past have not forgotten. There are things we value still.*  
*But we can with joy look forward, and the future now does thrill.*

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
