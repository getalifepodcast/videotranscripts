### [**Announcer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=20s)

Hello everybody, welcome to the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are back again here in the UK and we have with us our regular host Anne with us and Ros. And we're also joined this evening by Tina Nystrom from Sweden who has been a guest on Get-A-Life podcast and is joining to help us host it. Hello Tina.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=44s)

Hi, nice to be here.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=46s)

Thank you Tina. We have with us today our special guest John Gilliland. John left the Brethren some years back and will obviously be telling us his story about how and why. But just before we start, John, I understand you prefer to be called Gilly. And when you told me the reasons why, I thought that was quite symbolic, symbolic of the transition most people that leave the Brethren go through. So maybe you'd like to share with us why you prefer to now be called Gilly.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=78s)

Yeah, so I'm based in North Yorkshire and a lot of people in North Yorkshire use nicknames. So it kind of started naturally from my wife and her family, just using it as a, obviously, a shortening of my surname.

But over time I sort of got used to it and obviously because no one up here really knew me before, everyone sort of took on the nickname.

And it just grew and grew. And I just remember obviously meeting people who knew me previously and they would call me John, which obviously is their natural reaction.

But it really started to, as I started to go through therapy and stuff, it started to really, when I heard people call me by my original name, it really started to go to bring me back to, like to take me back to my past.

And just the, the, the, I much prefer going by my nickname one because I've never liked the name John but also just because it's,  it's, it's like a fresh start. It detaches, it detaches me from the past. That's what I find.  so that's why I prefer to go by it because it is a detachment from everything that's happened in my life and all, you know, all the negative,  so yeah, that's what, that's why I prefer it.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=164s)

Yeah, I think we'd all understand that it's kind of almost drawing a line over the John and starting again, which is something we've all had to try and do everyone that's left the Brethren, haven't they? So again, if I do call you John during this podcast, I apologise in advance. And I think Anne has known you a number of years as well and may also slip up. But anyway,

Okay, so maybe you'd like to start by sharing how you left the Brethren, why you left the Brethren, give us a bit of background.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=199s)

Yeah, so I mean the principal reason I left the Brethren was because I got into a relationship with someone from outside of the Brethren.

We were both working at the same place. We were both working for a company that was owned by Brethren. They obviously employed Brethren and non-Brethren and yeah, that's how that's how I came to leave was because I got into a relationship with someone from outside the Brethren and obviously as we all know that's forbidden. So that was the reason, but obviously there's a lot of the journey that was before that and after that really.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=242s)

Yeah, I mean we, I think we all know as you say a relationship with anybody outside the Brethren is not accepted but I can imagine there were things that led up to that that made you seek out that relationship even though you knew it would be something the Brethren would not accept. So let's give us some background to what led up to that relationship. Yeah, start at the beginning.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=266s)

Yeah, so I mean my personal story really begins before I was born. So my dad was second of four children. He was born in Belfast in Ireland.

At his time of birth, he was starved of oxygen, which made him slightly brain damaged.

His parents then moved the family to Birmingham when dad was a year old.

My mum was from Gloucester and she was an only child and her father left her and her mother when mum was four. He left the Brethren.

Her mother then developed a number of illnesses such as blindness, dementia and over time Alzheimer's.

So my dad and mum were married in September 75 and lived in Birmingham. But after six weeks of them being married the Brethren in Gloucester decided that Grandma Mitchell could no longer live alone and needed to be cared for and they decided that she should come and live with dad and mum in Birmingham. Obviously they'd only been married six weeks at the time.

So right from the start all of us children, all six of us children, grew up with our parents' time being divided between us and grandparents, which obviously impacted on our care at home and also meant that younger children were cared for by our older siblings, something which will explain circumstances later on in my story.

In 91, Grandpa Gilliland suffered a stroke which left him disabled down the one side of his body.

This meant that dad's parents now needed constant care and help so on the 22nd of January 92 we moved to a larger house with an annex on the side for dad's parents which obviously meant that they put money into the house.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=378s)

Yeah and at the time this wasn't an uncommon thing for the Brethren to do to have an annex, is that correct? A sort of a house with an annex for elderly parents or people that needed care?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=389s)

No it's not uncommon at all because it was very rare for elderly Brethren to end up in public care homes or private care homes. It was very much a thing of, you know, caring for elderly parents and it's not uncommon at all but I think the sort of thing with our situation was obviously dad and mum weren't very well off and so they needed the fact that grandpa had to put the money into the house which sort of made it difficult further on.

So by this time, so sort of early to mid 90s, we were living with mum's mother in what should have been the dining room and dad's parents in an annex.

And again, as we all know, there's massive class distinction in the Brethren and all these factors meant that we were heavily despised as a family and you know, all of us as children developed massive inferiority complexes.

But Grandma Mitchell, so mum's mother, then passed away in 95\. Then in 99 Grandma Gilliland suffered a heart attack during her sleep and passed away on a Saturday night.

And it did leave, when grandma passed away it left a massive hole in my life because she was always someone that you could go to and talk to and listen to. You know she'd got so many stories from her childhood in Ireland and it was, yeah, it was just, it was just some, even though I was only young, it was, it was even then it was an escape to just go and talk to her and she'd always have time for you.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=501s)

She had time for anybody.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=504s)

She did, yeah. She did.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=506s)

Lovely, lovely woman and I suppose I connected, we connected because of the Irish background. Both your grandparents used to talk a lot about their life in Belfast.

They were a comfort to me actually in my early marriage.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=523s)

Yeah, and I don't think you know even though I was young I probably didn't appreciate it enough at the time but she, you know, looking back and obviously now hearing stories from her relatives who are outside of the Brethren,  yeah, she, I mean she was the, if you want an epitome of the word saint, she was it. She was it. It was, she could never do, it wasn't, she could never do enough for anyone. She cared for grandpa after he had his stroke, even though she wasn't physically that strong, but she did everything for him.

So then grandpa Gilliland passed away in 2001\. He had an aneurysm, but obviously when he passed away, this meant that the money that he'd invested in the house was divisible between dad and his sister. Technically, it should have actually been divisible between all four of the children, but two of them were out of the Brethren, so they didn't get included in the will.

The executors of the will, two local elders, told Dad and Mum not to take out a loan to pay my aunt's share of the money, but rather that we'd have to move to a small house to release the capital.

So on the 14th of January 2002, we ended up moving as a family, effectively eight adults to a very small three bed house, three girls in one room and three boys in another.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=619s)

How old were you at that time?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=622s)

2000, where are we? 2001, 2002\. So I was 13\.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=628s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=630s)

Okay. So yeah, things just really went downhill from there because quite simply none of us had any personal space. It was just...

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=639s)

That's when you need it when you're a teenager.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=641s)

And prior to that, had you had enough bedrooms, your own bedroom, the house was big enough or you said you weren't three of you in one room or anything like that, were you?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=653s)

I mean, technically it was still a three bed house, but it was a very big three bed house. So the, you know, my sister's bedroom, our old house was like a massive L-shape, so it could have easily been split into three.

But yeah, we just literally, I mean, we were like, we were like in a dormitory. We were about a foot between the beds.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=676s)

The strange thing about that is that, I mean, Bruce Hales was sort of advocating that every child should have a bedroom at that time.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=686s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=687s)

And yet you were almost forced into, yeah, moving into that accommodation. Because I remember actually it would have been about that time that we extended our house to give more bedroom space for the children.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=700s)

Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=703s)

And say that that do that well the children should have their separate rooms is that yeah? I, yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=712s)

Interesting, yeah, I mean it came, it came in, I don't know, it was probably a similar time to that that, young, you know, young people buying houses should have four bedrooms and two bathrooms to be able to accommodate entertaining and all that and then yeah, having a bedroom for each child. So you ended up with,  you know, people doing random room conversions just to get, you know, you'd have,  you know, garages being converted into bedrooms and all sorts of space just so that,  you know, when I, I mean I'll come on to it later on, but when we, when we did eventually move,  my two brothers were in, were in a bigger bedroom and they literally had,  wardrobes down the middle of the room to create two rooms.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=761s)

Yeah, for goodness and privacy and space.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=769s)

Yeah, 2002 was the start of something awful. So I was 13 or 14 when my oldest sister, who would have been 25 at the time, and who had always looked after me as a child, started paying me special attention. Something I later in life had to acknowledge as sexual abuse. At the time she convinced me it was normal and there was nothing wrong with it.

But over the course of the next six years, six or so years, she continued to abuse me whenever she got the chance again, convincing me that it was okay.

When I started work, we both worked in Coventry, meaning we shared a vehicle, unfortunately given more opportunity to continue with our trail of abuse.

As I grew older, I began to realise that it wasn't normal and began to push back against it, at which point she brought my silence by telling me that if I told anyone, she would tell them that it was me who had started it.

Obviously the shame of this was enough to keep me quiet whilst at the same time being a very small part of me that still believed that it wasn't that bad because that's what I'd been told.

And then 2007-2008, an attempt to get away from home and the shame of what had happened and was still happening at home. I started going away for weekends with my brothers and other local young Brethren lads to work on meeting rooms, which meant I was going to places where people didn't necessarily know my background or my family's background. And having grown so fed up with the situation at home, I ended up moving away from home, still within the Brethren, but staying with friends in Guildford for a number of months.

With me living away from home it highlighted the fact to the local Brethren that there were problems at home, so they addressed the situation by telling us that we as children would have to put our money alongside the money from the sale of our existing house into a bigger house. Um.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=917s)

When you, just to sort of, when you moved away from home, obviously your subconscious motive, I imagine, was to get out of a situation that was desperate at home for you personally. But what sort of reason, and I imagine that was a situation at the time you felt you couldn't talk to anybody about, as you've just said. What sort of reason was put out? Why? Because it's unusual for the Brethren to stay for any length of time in another meeting unless there is a reason.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=947s)

Yeah, I mean, I think the reason that was put out was obviously the fact that we were very cramped in a small house that I think then at the time was acknowledged that we should never have been put into that situation.

So it was never, I mean, because I didn't come out, I didn't come out with the fact that I'd been abused. I mean, I sat on it for 10 years. So, you know, that wasn't, that wasn't knowledge at the time.  but yeah, I mean, you're right. I mean, I was, I'd be, I went down to Guildford on the Tuesday 17th of March, it was 2009,  and by the Friday night,  you know, we had Brethren from Birmingham phoning saying that I needed to be back in Birmingham. Thankfully, the people who I was staying with in Guildford were very firm and very strong and they just said, look, he's safe, he's got a job, he's fine. There's no point in him coming home right now because he'll just make the situation worse. 

So thankfully they backed me up and it sort of brought the whole situation to attention and it was, it wasn't just the fact that we were living in a, I mean, yes, obviously the house contributed to it, but it was also the years of, you know,  despise, all the, you know, the way dad had been, dad had been treated as a, you know, as a person and,  obviously we were, you know, as children we were all old enough to know now and to realize what was going on mostly when you're younger you don't necessarily have the guts to stand up against it but I think we'd all grown up and we'd all sort of realised what was going on and it was obviously it was affecting us.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1066s)

It's sort of interesting, isn't it? Because one thing that comes out in these conversations, a lot of people on it have used the phrase our family was at the bottom of the totem pole and I think a lot of people that have left have felt like that.  and you wonder how many people are still in there feeling like that.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1085s)

Yeah, there's no, there's no doubt that there will be plenty of people who still feel that way, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1092s)

In your case really it was, it was almost common and knowledge that your family was at the bottom of the rung.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1101s)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1103s)

I mean, it was, it was almost on the point of bullying, really.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1107s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1108s)

In my opinion, anyway.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1110s)

No, no, it definitely was.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1111s)

I thought, yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1113s)

And I think that's why, you know, when I, when I, when I went down to Guildford, I think the relief for me was that no one knew our background. Yeah. So if I went anywhere in the surrounding area around, around Birmingham, where I was from, everyone knew us. Everyone knew the background and, and you know, we would, you know, I remember as a kid having,  Brethren in the house on a Sunday night from, you know, from outside the area,  and they literally wouldn't eat, you know, they wouldn't eat what had been provided because you know, they'd heard such, you know, such horrible things about, you know, the supposed how, you know, how scummy we were and the rest of it.

And that's the kind of thing that, and it sticks with you and you remember it.

All the little things that people, the little comments that people make.

I've been out for 10 years now, so it's slowly, time does help things move on, but you still remember those little details.  and I think the, I think the other thing is when you've been in that situation for so long,  you know, there's a, there's a, it's almost becomes a,  deep down doubt that you can achieve things in life.  you know, there's things that, you know, there's things like, you know, career moves and things like that you think I'd love to do that and you instantly find yourself doubting that you can do it and you when you sort of strip it back you realize it's actually because you don't believe in yourself because of how you were put down as, you know, as a child and as a family.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1222s)

I'm still struggling, actually, still struggling with the feeling that I'm not good enough, especially as a woman. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, it is. And I speak to my, I mean I go to these what do you call it psychologists, yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1241s)

Therapists.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1242s)

Yeah, therapists, sorry. And they all come to the same conclusion. Yeah, to do with the background. Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1251s)

Yeah, you've kind of got a double whammy of it though I'm sure Gilly, because there's the sort of the way your family obviously with you just amongst the community that was the only community they knew. But then there's also this ethos that comes through the red my we think, you know, you're told from the day you're born because all of us were born into the Brethren,  and you're told from the day you were born that we are born in sin and shapen in iniquity, which is a biblical phrase, isn't it? And you grow up wherever you are in the Brethren hierarchy, you still grow up with that feeling I'm not worthwhile, I have no worth. And then if you've got compounded on that the how your family retreated, you know, I applaud you for still standing, John. You know, I really do. Yeah, it's just, yeah, it could break a better person. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1308s)

We were told, weren't we, Gilly, to look in the mirror every morning and say, oh, wretched man that I am. And that's still, I struggle. I still struggle massively with, yeah.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1325s)

Everybody, everybody that has, my manager at work and everything, she just says stop apologizing, you're, you're, you're doing fantastic and believe in yourself. Yeah, but it, you don't even realize that you're not if you know what I mean.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1342s)

Well no, because we've all been brought up with that,  you know, you're not worthwhile, you've been bought with a price and all those things that hammered into you. And then as I say you, you get it compounded with the fact the own community that believe the same thing are also looking down on you as a family. It's,  it's no wonder really is it that you grow up not believing in yourself. Yeah, anyway, carry on Gilly. So you, you, you, I know there's more to come.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1375s)

Yeah, so fast forward to the late spring of 2012 when my ex-wife, now Jo, she was half Swedish and half British and she began working at the same company as me.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1398s)

Probably being dumb but can I ask how old you were then?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1402s)

I was 20, hang on.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1403s)

I could tell you.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1407s)

I think I was 24\.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1410s)

You were 24, yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1414s)

So just to clarify, Anne, you were saying that Gil is about the same age as one of your children, is that correct? And you remember them?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1422s)

Yeah, we had a lot to do with each other. Well, even with your m because your mum was a bit older when she had you, and then I was the young mum with Clint, my first. So we would be in the foyer together, you know, as mums. But I think there's three weeks between. But while we were pregnant, we were like, you know, wondering if it was going to be the third. And then Gilly and Clint went to school together.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1456s)

So that's how you know how old he was when he was talking about it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1461s)

When I left, Clint was 24\. Which is just a few months after you, John. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1471s)

We digress. Carry on, Gilly. It happens.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1478s)

So no, obviously as already said, because I was in the Brethren, she was from outside, obviously it was completely forbidden.

But by the end of 2012, we'd formed a relationship in secret.

And obviously all the time that this was going on, things at home became extremely difficult because I was trying to hide something that I knew my parents, the local Brethren would be angry if they knew.

But yeah, things became so difficult at home. And on Christmas Eve of 2012, I moved in with my brother and his wife.

And then the Tuesday, which was the Christmas day, Christmas morning came and at breakfast I couldn't, I couldn't hold back my feelings anymore and I just broke down and told them I was pretty much in a relationship with Jo.

Straight away my brother said he couldn't deal with this alone so called a local elder around.

But the local elder he called around was the director of the company that we both were, that Jo and I both worked at.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1560s)

Oh, that's cool. No conflict of interest there then.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1568s)

Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1569s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1569s)

Didn't you, most of you as a family work for that company?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1574s)

Uh, no, not that one.  that was another one. Dad and my brother and my sister all worked for, yeah, that's...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1583s)

What I was thinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No I didn't work there. Thank you. You weren't there, right. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1588s)

 and yeah so it all began.  came around about 10 o'clock and the grilling started. I was foolish to think this would ever work, I was going directly against God and Bruce Hales, I'd let myself down, I'd let the local Brethren down and more importantly I'd let God and Bruce Hales down.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1611s)

Of course the two are one and the same aren't they?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1613s)

Yeah I'd argue that one's higher than the other at the moment.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1616s)

Well, yeah, yeah. Yeah there is that.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1621s)

And yeah, he then left and said he'd return at 5 p.m. which he duly did. By then, by the, by now, they said it was crunch time, I had to make my mind up.

Was I staying with the idea of being with Jo or was I going to do the right thing and stay with the Brethren as being the only safe place, the only place that God could bless me, the only true position, etc, etc. And I, you know, obviously at the time I was, I, I didn't necessarily at that point in time, I didn't necessarily see the Brethren as being the wrong place. So I sat there for ages just saying nothing and I couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to break contact with Jo.

And eventually my brother just said to me, look, if you don't feel you can say it, then write it down. And I hesitated because I knew what I really wanted to write would break his and the rest of the family's heart, but I couldn't do anything about the way I felt. So I wrote down on that bit of paper, "I'm going with Jo." He handed it to the elder and as soon as he saw it he told me that I would be confined, which I'd already accepted anyway.

I ran up to the bedroom I was staying in and broke down. The sheer relief of actually stating where I stood was just, was immense. But the next day was, was honestly one of the worst days of my life. My other brother and his wife came around, pretty much the whole day was spent by them preaching at me, telling me how wrong it was, how evil it was, quoting ministry from Bruce Hales, me saying whatever they could to try and convince me to change my mind. 

But for some reason unbeknown to me it only became, it only made my convictions go with Jo stronger. So my brother then informed me that evening that the elder was coming again at 10 a.m. the next morning.  and on hearing that I knew I had to be out before he arrived if I was to, if I was to go. So I contacted Jo via email and asked if she would collect me at,  7 a.m. the next morning, which she promised she would.

That night I hardly got any sleep at all because I was convinced something was going to go wrong with the plan as I thought, you know, at the time I thought God was going to come in on judgment.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1768s)

Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1769s)

Then the morning of the, morning of the 27th of December 2012 came. Little did I know but that was the day that changed my life forever.

I was up showered early with the two bags of stuff I had with me both packed and ready to go when Jo emailed me to say she was outside. I went downstairs to supposedly get a drink to find my fears were confirmed. Every door and window was locked and barred with no sign of any keys anywhere.

At 24, I was locked inside a house.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1813s)

Oh, that's the worst I ever heard.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1821s)

So my mind began to race.

God brought his judgment on me. Was I not going to be able to escape? Was my heart not really supposed to feel for Jo the way it did? I was so mixed up. I just didn't know what to do, but something made me go and face out my brother and dealt him with a blow he'd been fearing. I wanted to leave right there and then.

He urgently tried to convince me not to, and his wife went hysterical, but eventually he had to admit I was legally of an age where they couldn't hold me against my will.

Finally, he unlocked the door.

I thanked them for what they'd done. I walked out of his house for the last time ever.

I jumped into Jo's car and just said drive, we need to get out of here. All I had was two bags of clothes and a few possessions but obviously as I left at Christmas time we now both face the dubious fact of returning to work. I wasn't even sure if I had a job to return to as the elder had told me that I was risking everything by pursuing my own will. I wasn't the first day back I was called into a meeting with the elder and one of his sons, which lasted about two to three hours with them repeatedly preaching at me and trying to convince me to change my mind.

So I told them I needed time to think, so they adjourned until the next day.

The next day came, I was called into a meeting again. This time they offered me to send me to Australia for a month or two, but I just couldn't bring myself to break away from Jo.

When they finally asked what my decision was going to be, once again I just sat there. I knew what I wanted to say but I knew I was risking by saying it. Eventually I couldn't say anything other than "I'm going with Jo."

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1938s)

At this point, sorry, what did they think that Australia would do? I mean whatâ€¦

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1945s)

So around that time it was quite common, and I think it still, it's obviously happened since I left, that it was quite common for people to be sent to Australia for encouragement and essentially, I mean in my case it would have been a case for me, it would have been a case for me to have broken contact with Jo and, you know, for Jo to have been told that I would, you know, that I was out of reach and they probably would have made, you know, probably would have made her redundant conveniently while I was out the way, out of the picture.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=1974s)

I heard a tale of another person similar age to you, a little younger than you, that did get sent to Australia and went out there. They were wined and dined in a style that was very un-Brethren-like and they were so desperate to get back home because they were thinking about leaving and they found that their passport had been taken away. So it is basically, I suppose it's encouragement, but it's, it's not, it's another form of entrapment in a way. Yeah, you obviously recognize that when they offered you this wonderful trip to Australia.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2011s)

Yeah, because and I think the thing in my case, I'd, so a close friend of mine had moved to Australia as they do in the bedroom to a smaller place, yes. And I'd be and they probably moved in probably about 2009 I think it was and I'd been trying to go out there like from 2009 and you know I kept, kept asking if I could go and I was always told no, we couldn't go, you know, you haven't got a basis to go, you haven't got to go, you know, you can't, you can't have a legitimate reason. But the minute, the minute I then said I was leaving, all of a sudden Australia was okay.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2048s)

So just to explain to listeners who perhaps weren't in the Brethren and correct me if I've got this wrong, but if you want to travel anywhere you cannot do so without permission. So most people would think John as a 20-something year old that's had a friend, sorry Gilly, as a 20-something year old, well you were John then, Gilly as a 20-something year old that had a friend in Australia could just book his own flight and go and see his friend. But that's not allowed, is it? You you have to have a valid reason, you have to get permission.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2080s)

Yeah, I mean 90 or, I'd probably say 99% at the time, the only reason they travel is to go to a meeting.

So if you were fortunate enough to go on a trip to Australia, it would be two weeks and it would be filled with special meetings.

You might get to see a few tourist attractions, depending on who you stayed with.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2106s)

But to go to friends is even more not allowed.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2112s)

Oh yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2114s)

Special friends, definitely not.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2116s)

No, no, you can't have special friendships.

But yeah, so obviously I told him, my boss and his son, that I was going with Jo.

And at this point, my boss and the elder all in one pushed a letter across the table, which I'd never seen before, but it was written in my name saying, "I, John Gilliland, hereby resign as of the 31st of January."

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2150s)

Wow.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2151s)

And told to sign it.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2153s)

I'm so gobsmacked about all this. There's so many things that are not legal that they are doing.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2159s)

I agree with you Tina, and how do they get away with it? And I know how they get away with it, because they are pushing people, I've heard this time and again, they push people that are extremely vulnerable. And at that point in time, what Gilly, there's two of them in a room with you, you know that you've committed an ultimate sin, you've gotten to, I'm putting sin in inverted commas, and you've got into relationships with someone outside of the Brethren in an employment situation. You would have somebody with you representing you. Forget the religion, the Brethren bit, if there's a situation at work where they've got an issue with you, you should have someone there representing you and defending you. And yet they just ride roughshod over vulnerable people. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2209s)

Yeah, I mean if, if, if obviously if I knew then what I know now, and never would have even pushed it back and laughed at him. I mean, I was given, you know, they paid for me to go to a solicitor and, you know, they'd drawn up a compromise agreement, which basically covered their backsides that I wouldn't, you know, if I signed a compromise agreement, I wouldn't bring it, it would never come up against them. And I remember at the time, obviously, again, going back to what I said earlier, at the time I left the president, I didn't necessarily see them as wrong. So you have to bear that in mind. And when I went to the solicitor, even I remember the solicitor saying to me, he said, are you sure you want to sign this?

He said, because this is just, he said, this is, I mean, this is just one of the worst things I've ever seen. And at the time I just said, yeah, look, I just want to get out of the way.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2265s)

And I think that's something again to try and explain to listeners that weren't in the Brethren. If you were never there, most people would say, why on earth would you sign it? And so on. But the mental battering you have at the point you are at now, where you know you have no choice if you want to be with Jo than to leave the Brethren. So that mental battering where they're throwing everything that's been ingrained at you from birth is really hard to take, you know, really hard to stand up to. And I'm sorry, I think you wanted to say something.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2303s)

No, I was going to say that I was given exactly the same when they made me redundant. I'd been out, left the Brethren for a year, but I was still working for them and they just made my job redundant. And they got me to try, to get me to sign something that just would never have held up in court. When I, and they, and they told me to go to a solicitor about it and when I went she said, this has got to be fair right down the middle. Turn it all around on them and say they've got to do the same thing then, yeah. And she just said I'll rewrite it completely the same but for them as well. Yeah, it was the thing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2353s)

Sorry, go on.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2354s)

No, I was just going to reiterate that everything that they'd ask me to keep secret and or you know to not speak about whatever, same goes for them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2366s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's the same whenever I was getting custody of the two youngest, they drew off their own parental responsibility agreement and tried to get me to sign it. But thankfully, my solicitor who I'd already appointed was like, no way, you are not, you are going to court, you know, even though I didn't really understand the system at the time.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2393s)

Yeah, yeah, he was...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2394s)

He stood up for me, thankfully, thankfully. But people do ask that, you know, people that haven't been in the Brethren, you know, why on earth like, in my situation, didn't you go to the police?

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2406s)

You couldn't. No, it's very hard to explain the whole way, haven't you? And where I sympathise, Gilly, is at that point, you didn't necessarily realise the Brethren system was quite what it is. And I certainly didn't when I left either. So there's still that bit of you all the time thinking, I'm walking away from what might be the only right way. And that's tough, isn't it?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2429s)

Yeah, and it's that thing of, you know, I'm in the wrong here, so I just need to get this. It's an interesting question that's come up because so many times I have, you know, when people know about my background, people ask me, well, you know, why don't people just, why don't people just go against the rules? And I think for, you know, for an analogy that I've used in the past to try and explain it. 

So my now wife is a farmer's daughter and the farm is at the end of a long lane with a cattle grid at the end. And I've said to her in the past, I said, if from the day you were born your parents told you that if you went past the end of that cattle grid a monster's gonna get you, you would believe it because that's all you've ever known. Yeah, and I think it's the same thing is when people ask you why didn't people just rebel? Because you just didn't, because it was...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2481s)

No.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2482s)

You were too scared to. Yeah.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2483s)

But it's not... It's not just your parents, it's a whole community.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2492s)

It's a whole community, yeah, yeah. And that's why, and again, I know this might be a little bit me on my soapbox again, why I think with the UK where we have the coercive control laws and the move to try and get it so that coercion can happen within a group. I think what you're describing Gilly in your story is absolutely that in evidence. It's a group. Yeah, it's a group coercing you to do things that most people wouldn't do, that's illegal, it isn't right. And yet you'll do it because of that mental coercion, but it's not coming from one individual person. It's the ethos of a group. But the behavior when it's with one individual person is exactly the same. So it's in a close, it's the same behavior with the same outcome.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2539s)

Yeah, and those people like our parents are also being... Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2545s)

You mentioned about your brother's wife,  when you told him being hysterical, which a lot of people would think if you put that in sort of really the cold light of day, your brother's wife's hysterical because you're having a relationship with somebody outside your church. Now when you put it like that most people would say, and, but we can all understand why your brother's wife became hysterical because she would believe that you were just going into a deep dark place wouldn't she?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2574s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and it, and it's I think it's the, the other thing with that is the, it's the unknown for them. You know, they're told that it's the outside world is so evil and it's and I remember a couple of weeks, so you know, obviously in the early days of me leaving my my family did keep in touch, but I, I remember my other brother asking me at the time, a couple of weeks after I'd left, because it was so foreign to them, the idea of someone being outside, he asked me if I was still having three meals a day. It's like, my life hasn't changed that much that I'm now incapable of feeding myself.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2615s)

You're suddenly not human. I'm sorry to laugh, but it is.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2620s)

It's true.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2622s)

It's true, yeah. I remember somebody coming to the door to try and preach to me and they actually pushed their way in and he looked around the room, the lounge, and he went, well it's good to see that you know you're keeping your house up together still, like hello? Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2638s)

Yeah, you haven't gone to computer yet.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2641s)

Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2642s)

Yeah, you're right, it's very hard for people that have never been with that mind control, with that circumstantial control to really get it.  I, I think people do and I think people have been in that situation in other groups and other but it's, it's when you talk about it in absolute simple terms it does sound ridiculous doesn't it but we all know how strong that is.  yeah so you then had to resign, sorry.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2669s)

Gone. So I was gonna say she would have literally been petrified. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2674s)

Yeah, yeah, I mean it was, it was, it was the point of me,  you know, it was the point, literally the point, so I'd almost come into a physical fight to get, you know, to get my brother's keys off him to open the door and it was the point that, you know, I picked up my bags and I think, I think at the time she, she, she was in the bathroom and, you know, he called up the stairs to say I was, you know, that he I was leaving and she literally came down the stairs in hysterics to,  yeah, because of what we said, she just didn't know what I was going into and feared the absolute worst.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2715s)

So you ended up having to leave your work, I assume. What happened to Jo with work?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2721s)

So yeah, so after I'd signed this letter in my name that I'd never seen, I was then told to collect my stuff and leave immediately.  and I'd got a company car at the time. They allowed me to keep that for the week but I had to hand it back at the end of the week obviously.  and then subsequently,  a month later when I was off the books so I couldn't,  you know, I couldn't legally as I couldn't as a fellow employee I couldn't, I didn't legally have rights, Jo was conveniently made redundant and made to sign, she was made to sign a compromise agreement as well.

The only thing that sort of went against her being able to stand up more was that she hadn't been there for a year and obviously in employment law, someone who hasn't been there for a year doesn't have as many rights. Yeah.  so yeah,  that was...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2788s)

At that point in time, how equipped did you feel as an individual to find alternative work? And I'm asking this question because I think if somebody is thinking of leaving the only employment you've ever had is Brethren work, isn't it?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2803s)

Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2804s)

And I'd imagine, I mean it's slightly different when I was in the Brethren because we were allowed to work for outsiders and when I left I worked for you know people that weren't Brethren and that helped enormously. But that's not something people have now and how much does that fear hold people do you think?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2823s)

Massively. And I think the other thing especially even more, I mean it was bad enough when when I left just over 10 years ago, yeah, but even more so now they are paid such extortionately high wages. And I, you know, I've seen it with people who have contacted me wanting to leave and they have an unrealistic expectation about what they can, you know, what they can earn. And what I would say to anyone, you know, if there is anyone who listens to this who was thinking of leaving, what I would say is take any work you can get, anything. It doesn't matter what it is. If you're on a minimum wage, forget the, you know, get as hard as it is, get the idea out of your head that you have to have this highfalutin lifestyle. You do not. You can build up, you can start again at the bottom, build up, and if that's the lifestyle you're after, then yeah, you can get there, but work for it. You do not have anything handed to you on a plate.

Yeah, obviously, there's going to be people out there who will help you as much as they can, but get the unrealistic, realistic expectations out of your head and just be prepared to start what the Brethren would probably view was at the bottom. Do anything. If it, whatever it is, just take whatever work you can get. That was the biggest mistake I made when I left was, you know, the, you know, even the, even down to the house, and I'll happily admit, you know, that I made mistakes, there was the house that we first rented, I insisted it had to be detached because I was that brainwashed to think that and I was stupid. I should have got, you know, should have just got an apartment, would have been absolutely fine for two of us. And straight away, I was looking for, because I'd been in a sales role, I was looking for another sales role. Realistically, I probably was never suited to sales, but it was what I was shoehorned into.

And I think that's another thing is the, coming back to the point I was just making is that people have this, because they're shoehorned into roles that, because they're so limited career options, they're shoehorned into roles they're not really suitable for. And they have this sort of disdain for practical roles or whatever it is. But, you know, take anything you can get because it'll see you through.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2975s)

Sorry, and it's more important just to get the job for the social piece, not for the wage and not for that, but just to get out there and meet friends and have a social network outside. That's more important than actually the pay.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2990s)

Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=2990s)

I agree, Tina. And John, I, Gilly, I think it's absolutely sound advice. I,  know of somebody who left fairly recently and,  has taken a job as a kitchen porter doing shift work and it's given them purpose, it's given them a reason, it's given them income,  and but as you say it's because of the way the Brethren are channeled into you must have a big detached, well you must have a detached house and the bigger the better and it's and therefore you must earn this salary to go with it.  but what that particular person said to me is my mind is free. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and I just think that that's something you can't put up, right? Well, so yeah, you agree it's absolutely, yeah, yeah.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3043s)

Freedom is just all and everything and just to start afresh anywhere. You're waking up in the morning free every day. You can read your own and you can do it your way.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3060s)

Yeah. Go on, John. Gilly?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3063s)

I was going to say the other thing I would say to anyone who's listening to this and thinking of leaving. Don't be scared. Don't think you have to have a nine to five either, Monday to Friday. Take anything, if it means working nights, if it means working weekends, whatever it is, just take it because yeah, you might not, you might not like it for the long term, but it will get you started and like Tina referred to, it will give you a view of the outside world, it will give you a social interaction,  that that will become invaluable especially if you're leaving on your own. You need those people around you.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3097s)

Yeah, you have to broaden your horizons, don't you? Your horizons have to broaden.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3103s)

Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3104s)

So I think that's very sound advice for anyone that's sitting there thinking, won't be easy, will it? But if you lower your expectations and the freedom is worth it. Yeah. So you and Jo did end up marrying, didn't you? Is that correct?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3124s)

Yeah, yeah. So I mean that was obviously when I'd left, that was, you know, that was the end of my life as I'd known it up until that point.  everything changed forever. I was cut off from everyone and everything I'd ever known.  and like someone was just referring to a minute ago, you know, overnight I went from being a family member, you know, being able to walk into dad and mum's house freely to being treated like a criminal. I wasn't allowed in dad and mum's house without a chaperone. And yeah, whilst I did have people around me, I just felt so alone and abandoned.

But yeah, so over the last 10 years, there's obviously been a whole load of firsts in my life and things, but things take a long time to get accustomed to.  you know, it's 24\. Essentially I had to learn how to live again because you're so used to thinking in one way and you're afraid to go against that way of thinking.  I remember one instance in particular, it was our first,  it was our first holiday. We actually went to  St. Lucia in the Caribbean, but it had been, it's been drummed into me for so long that if you go against God, all these terrible things were going to happen.

 Obviously, at the time we were in the Midlands and we had to drive to Gatwick and I was literally all the way down, even though I was excited to be going, all the way down to the airport in the back of my head, you're going to have an accident, something bad's going to happen. You get there and you haven't had an accident and you go into the airport, something's going to happen through security, something's going to go wrong. Get through security, nothing happens. You're in the departure lounge, something's going to go wrong, nothing happens. You get on the plane, the plane's definitely gonna, definitely, the plane's definitely gonna come down.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3244s)

Oh yeah, I mean we laugh but it's very real isn't it? Yeah, so real. And that's the thing you know.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3252s)

We went for two weeks and don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thoroughly enjoyed the holiday, but all the time at the back of your mind, there's this constant, you know, all the activity, all the activities we did, you know, we did,  you know, we did jet skiing, we did ziplining, all the time at the back of your mind it's that constant thought that something's going to go wrong. Yeah.  yeah, waiting to judge you.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3274s)

Yeah, the Sundays were the worst, right? Because then knew that was when it was going to come. Yeah, yeah. And so I'd never do anything bad on the Sunday.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3290s)

Monday to Saturday you lived a life, but yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3295s)

You're the same man. Yeah, I remember even though I thought I got over all that. So I remember sort of four years later realizing that every Sunday when I went out for a walk or went out anywhere as soon as I saw a Brethren car, I relaxed. Yeah, because I realized the rapture hadn't come.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3318s)

Yeah, maybe we should just, and just explain but I mean I totally get that comment but just explain what it means when we see a Brethren car at 9 a.m. on a Sunday and realize the rapture hasn't come. So what were the Brethren told, you explain.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3332s)

Yeah, so we were, the rapture is when we were going, the Brethren would be raptured up into heaven.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3339s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3340s)

And we would go up on a cloud with the Lord. And it was going to happen at the Lord's Supper or the communion, which is at 6 a.m. in the morning. So if you got to sort of nine o'clock and saw some of the Brethren still arrived, you thought, oh, I've got another week.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3356s)

I've got another week.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3358s)

But I thought I'd got over that. You know, I was shocked at myself when I realized. Because you know at that time I'd gone through cancer. I mean in their eyes God had punished me. Yeah, and but yeah, but still at the back of my mind that little thing.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3377s)

Yeah it takes a long time. Yeah. I mean did you find that Gilly when you left that it took a long time to let that those subconscious thoughts, it's going to go wrong, something awful is going to happen, go?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3388s)

Yeah, yeah, 100%. And I think there's one thing that, one thing I always come back to is as I referred to earlier and I'll refer to it again in a minute is, so I've got two uncles who left the Brethren back in the 70s and 80s. But one of the, one of the things one of them always said to me was, like I said, obviously he's been out for a good number of years now, but he always said to me, he said, what you need to, especially in those early days when I was struggling mentally, he said what need to remember is that if you look at your life as a percentage or a fraction, it's still the large percentage of your life that's been spent in the, within the Brethren. So you are going to, you know, have those thoughts because you know, at the time, what, I'd been in the Brethren for 24 years and been out two, you know, it's, it's, it's a massive part of your, of your, the way your brain's conditioned.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3448s)

Yeah, and you can't just undo that line of thinking overnight, can you? No, it takes many different situations to realize, like you say, going on holiday and realize actually the plane didn't crash and we didn't get hijacked and we, you know, it and actually it was all okay to realize, to start to slowly deprogram that thinking, doesn't it?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3471s)

Yeah. And even just like in your views in life in general, your political views, your views on anything outside of the Brethren, you have contact with someone who's recently left and you're almost sort of all sort of jerked back to this almost prehistoric way of thinking. But it's, you know, you know, it's not, you know, you're not judging them for it because you know, you remember being there.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3502s)

That was me so many years ago. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3504s)

Yeah.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3505s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So you enjoyed your holidays in in the Caribbean anyway.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3511s)

Yeah, we did.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3512s)

You had a good time. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=3514s)

And then, uh, yeah, we got back,  and yeah, mid-2013, we found out that we were pregnant with our first child.

Unexpected, but a joy no less. And my eldest son was born in February 2014\.

Another change that I'll never forget, the day I became a father.

So yeah, throughout the next year, with such massive changes happening and not having much support around me, being made redundant from jobs that, you know, like I just referred to a minute ago, realistically I probably wasn't suitable for, yeah, I began to spiral into a dark place mentally.

I just felt like I'd failed. I couldn't carry out my duties as a father, like I wasn't being a good husband and I had this, this thing in the back of my mind that the Brethren had, what the Brethren had drummed into me that I wouldn't make it in the outside world was coming true.

After months of feeling worse and worse, I eventually hit rock bottom. I felt helpless, not good enough. In my eyes, the people around me would have been better off without me. So having left a message and apologies for close family in our bedroom, I attempted to finish things. I attempted suicide for the first time.

Jo, having seen the message, got to me in time and managed to stop me following through with it.

In desperation she phoned one of my brothers to plead for help.

His response to Jo when she said that I just attempted suicide was, "Do you think he meant it?" Wow. Yes, yeah. But having put us through that, I realized I needed to get some help but I eventually went for a therapy session in a class environment which although in itself wasn't great it did make me realize I was deeply depressed, something I'd tried to deny for a long time. A few months later I was back in that dark place again. I hit rock bottom yet again. Again, I felt useless, helpless, nowhere to turn, failing everything I was trying to do. But I was just too proud to reach out, too proud to talk about how I truly felt. I wanted everyone to think I could cope, to think I was strong by pushing through when in reality, the real strong thing to do would have been to admit how low I was. And again, that feeling of everyone being better off without me crept up on me.

I attempted suicide and again, again and again, Jo prevented me from following it through to completion. Following this, I knew I had to talk to someone if I was to survive. I began talking to close family and friends, which seemed to stabilize me and having found work, I was steady for a while.

In 2015, we discovered we were pregnant again.

Leighton was born in January 2016\.

Fast forward to July 2017, following being made redundant again, we felt we needed a complete reset, a chance to start over, a chance to build a life away from all the history of the last few years.

We made the decision to move to Sweden as family. I moved in there in August 2017\.

But moving in with Swedish family, you know, as kind as it was for them to take us in, obviously it proved very difficult.

Before long, I had all that all too familiar feeling of being alone, no one to reach out to, feeling abandoned.

Combining that with the language barrier and I was spiraling downwards fast into a dark place mentally once again.

All too soon those dark, horrible thoughts were back, except this time there was the added familiarity of how it felt after leaving the Brethren. No family around, very few friends, no one I felt I could talk to.

Once again I was at rock bottom with what I felt was no option but to put an end to the pain, an end to this cycle, thinking my sons would be better off with someone else to bring them up, someone that could do a better job than me.

I sat out on a walk to the local harbour, intending to end everything.

Whilst I was walking there, a very close friend from the UK who had messaged me every day struck up his daily conversation.

Quickly realising things were badly wrong, he called me.

After an hour on the phone, he talked me back from the water's edge, something I'll never be able to thank him enough for.

Following this latest mental health collapse, I again sought help.

Thankfully the Swedish take mental health very seriously and I was referred to a therapist who was absolutely brilliant. I was prescribed medication for the first time since leaving the Peebs, the Brethren. I felt like I was getting somewhere mentally. Working through therapy sessions 10 years after the abuse had stopped, I finally had the strength to acknowledge to myself that my sister had sexually abused me. Whilst I didn't discuss the abuse with my therapist, the realization struck deep.

Maybe it wasn't normal after all. Maybe I wasn't at fault, like I've been made to believe. Maybe it wasn't okay.

The end of April 2018, I came back to the UK to try and gain a qualification to help me get work in Sweden. Initially living with my uncle, then finding my own flat. A month or so after moving back, our marriage came to an end, resulted in me staying in the UK and then visiting Sweden to see my two sons.

Towards the end of 2018, Emily, my now wife, and I met online. We then started dating, moving to a long distance relationship. In the May of 2019, I moved here to where I am now.

But during that time, we were out for breakfast with an ex-Brethren friend and her boyfriend one weekend. We were discussing the Brethren and the subject of abuse within the Brethren came up.

He innocently made the comment that he thought there was more of it than people realised. I couldn't say anything. I just stared out the window, tears streaming down my face.

Thankfully, I'd told Emily only a few days before, so she knew what made me upset. So we walked out of the cafe and for the first time ever, I was able to tell someone the full details of the hell of the six years of abuse.

Following my move to this area and my therapy in Sweden, I knew I had to get more therapy to help get over all the elements I passed.

I did find a therapist who I told everything to going through intensive sessions week after week to get over not just the abuse but the years of brainwashing and conditioning of my upbringing in the Brethren. The process was, you know, it was intense, it was grueling, reliving every hellish moment from my past at times, almost breaking me, the brutal realization that my own, you know, my own sister had actually engaged in paedophilia. But I knew I had to push through if I was going to be in a better place mentally and I was going to be a better person not just for those around me but for myself. I can never describe the feeling of knowing I wasn't at fault for the abuse, that it wasn't something I'd done, that I wasn't responsible for it.

In August 2020, I proposed to Emily. Thankfully, she said yes.

We were married on 31st of July in 2021\. We discovered we were expecting early 22 and my youngest son was born in October just last year.

And also on the 27th of December 2022 it was, I celebrated 10 years of freedom away from the control of the cult I was brought up in. Freedom to love, freedom to make choices, freedom to make decisions for myself, freedom to be true to myself, freedom to be the person who I want to be.

And you know, I couldn't thank everyone enough who has been part of this journey and obviously Emily has been there through thick and thin and you know, for her and for others it's such a hard journey to understand, but the fact that you know, the fact that she stood by me has just been everything.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4062s)

She's great, your Emily. She is. I mean, I think that's what you've been through is an incredible story. And I think, A, I think you're very, very brave to talk so candidly about it. It's like when Cheryl first spoke about the abuse that she had suffered. I think to talk openly and candidly about it takes enormous courage, but I think is needed.

And I wonder, John, what you would, Gilly, sorry, I wonder what you would say to anybody who is carrying a similar burden that you've carried all those years now. How you feel now, having come out and spoken about what happened and sought help about it? Because I'm sure there's other people carrying the same burden of knowing.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4110s)

Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think the, you know, and when I say this, I genuinely hope, you know, I genuinely hope in one sense, there's no one who does listen to this, who has been through what I and millions of others have been through in all sorts of forms of abuse. But if there is anyone listening to this, what I would say is, it's, you know, it took me 10 years for me to come out with the abuse that I'd been through, because of the shame, the thought of that somehow it was my fault. But the one thing I'd say to anyone who's been through this or is or you know, been through or is currently going through, if you're not telling someone about it, ask yourself, who are you protecting?

If you're not protecting yourself, why not? Why are you, why are you protecting a perpetrator? Why are you putting yourself through more by protecting someone else that doesn't deserve protection? You protect yourself at all costs. I know it's, you know, and if there's anyone who's listening to this who's still currently in the Brethren and has been through that, I know it is very, very difficult because it's all swept under the carpet, and especially if it's something that's, you know, if it's something that could publicly bring shame on them, they'll do whatever they can to hide it. But you're worth more than that.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4201s)

But yeah, it goes back to the thing that we're not worth anything. Because we have to realize that you are the most important person in your life. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4214s)

And that's one thing that actually my therapist I had in Sweden, she was absolutely brilliant. But the one thing I'll always remember, I'll always come back to from the one thing she taught me was, you know, I was talking about not doing a good enough job of being a good husband and a good father. And she just stopped me and said, how do you expect to look after others if you don't look after yourself first? And, you know, my upbringing and all our upbringing will tell us, oh, you know, you need to put others first. And yes...

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4249s)

That's not...

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4250s)

That's not, that's not a bad thing to look after others, but you can't look after others if you're not caring for yourself first.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4259s)

You have to be well mentally and fit mentally yourself.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4262s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4263s)

I've got an analogy that Dan uses for that so yeah because because obviously I over the years I've had a lot of guilt about my children and he said well on an airplane when they do the safety procedure and they talk about the oxygen mask, who has to put the oxygen mask on first before they can help anybody else?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4286s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4287s)

That's, that's a...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4288s)

Very good analogy. Yeah, because they expressly say that, don't they, before you put it on your children, you put it on yourself. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4295s)

So, so how can, how can I help my children if I'm not helping myself?

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4301s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's absolutely true.  and, and then there's another thing you touched on John, uh, Gilly, that,  you know, there were points when you felt life wasn't worth carrying on. And I know when you did a talk recently you put, you were raising funds for the Samaritans, weren't you? And I think we'll put a link to the UK Samaritans helpline on this podcast in case anybody is listening and is feeling as you felt on those occasions.  but can you explain the sort of, something brought you back and something took you there, something brought you back?

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4342s)

Yeah, I mean the, I think the, the, the biggest point that all that brought me back from those suicidal times is is reaching out, talking.

And, you know, I know everyone says, oh just talk to someone. And I know that there's a lot of people who go, you know, I'm not a talker, you know, I'm not that sort of person, but reach out to someone, whether it's a professional, it's whether it's a family member or, you know, a friend, you know, you've just referred to the Samaritans.

You know, they offer a, you know, offer a 24-hour phone line and you can just talk to anyone and even if you don't feel like talking they've got a facility where you can write or email and I think it's, it's just so so crucial to just reach out.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4406s)

So that perhaps raises another question I have because I know there are people in the Brethren that feel suicidal at times and I think if you're in the Brethren, perhaps I suppose what I'd say to you is what would you say to somebody in the Brethren that's feeling like I don't want to carry on with this and I can't see a way out? Because I suspect although I don't know if they reached out to somebody within the Brethren they'd be told, well you need to get right with God. I mean that would be this, I mean, so it would, it be trying to give them the courage to say phone Samaritans, phone a helpline? Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4446s)

Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's, there's, like you just referred to, the, you know, the, the inference inside will be that if you've got mental health weakness, it'll be, there'll be something wrong with you morally,  but it's, it's not the case and, yeah,  you know, the, the Brethren will make you feel guilty for that,  for feeling that way and possibly even put you down for it. But if there, you know, if there is someone feeling that way,  just as hard as it is and you know as much as you might not see it right now, things can and will get better. You know, that just make that, make that call, make that, you know, talk to someone out, you know, if you, if you work in a, if you work in a business place that employees non-Brethren, speak to someone. I know plenty of people who have left the Brethren by doing that, by just talking to... And nine times out of 10, if it's someone who works for the Brethren, they'll have some idea of what the situation is.

But yeah, whoever it is, just remember that things can and will get better. I mean, there was, you know, the times I referred to, I was, I literally couldn't think, I could not see how things were going to improve. You know, it was just, there was just nothing, at that point in time there is nothing that could have convinced me that things were going to get better. And yeah, it's been a hell of a, hell of a journey, it's been a hell of a ride and hasn't been all been smooth sailing. But you know, I'm in a much, much better place now and you know, I'm blessed with a, you know, I've got a loving wife and I've got three sons. Yeah, I've got two, two sons from our previous marriage, doesn't mean I love them any less, you know, it's life's, life's journey.  so yeah, things might not be perfect, but yeah, honestly, and and another thing I want to say to anyone who is listening to this, you might be considering leaving the Brethren, because I remember this being drummed into me so, so much, not everybody in the outside world is evil.

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4589s)

I was gonna say, far, far less evil than inside. Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4597s)

Absolutely, I will, I will 100% I will hold my hand up and say, you know, all the time I used to, I used to look, you know, because of the way I taught to think, you used to look down on people from the outside world. Trust me, there are far more caring and genuinely caring people outside of the Brethren than you will ever, ever imagine and you know, sincere and genuine,  you know, people who actually care. They haven't, they haven't got a reason to, yeah, to want to flatter you. And it's, it's interesting just coming just on that point, I remember my ex-wife, her grandparents were very, very good to us when I first left. I mean they're very good to us all along but I remember her saying, her grandmother gave me a compliment and I instinctively went to bat it away and you know I kept doing it and eventually Jo said to me, he said, look, you've got to stop doing this. I said, what? And she said, you've got to stop pushing these compliments away because people are going to get offended. And she said, you know, people aren't giving you compliments just because they've got an ulterior motive, they genuinely mean it. And I think it just highlights the point that people haven't got an ulterior motive, you know, people don't know you, they've never met you before and they give you a compliment or they look after you and they care for you. It's genuine.

And there are so many people in the outside world who will care for you, who will look after you. And I've been in situations where people have given me a bed for the night, people have put me up for a weekend with, you know, didn't really know me at all but they'll, they will do it and that is one point I'd want to make to anyone who, you know, who's the, who's got the fear of leaving because of the fear of the outside world and what people are going to be like. Yeah, of course there's evil people in the world, but I'd like to think at this point in time, the good still outweighs the bad.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4733s)

And you don't, you don't have to, you've got a choice, you don't have to associate with those people.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4738s)

Exactly.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4738s)

That's just what I was going to say. You, you, you can, you can choose not to have anything to do with people that you are not comfortable with.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4747s)

Yeah, but...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4748s)

Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4748s)

No, it's just, I was just, I was just thinking, I was thinking what I was thinking what Ros just referred to a minute ago, you know, finding more people,  you know, than they found inside. When you look at it realistically, the the people that you associate with in the Brethren, what you actually got in common with them?

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4769s)

Yeah. But that also, the outside, everybody outside haven't been conditioned to be nice and to be flowery and to be fake and to be this person that is gonna come up and be the best host and the best, you know, if you don't get along with someone, they just avoid you. They don't, they don't have to be nice, you know, it's just that and that's and that's what I like. It's just literally facial and most, mostly, in fact like 90% of if not more than that,  everyone, everyone is out to be nice, to be good to you, to give you an experience, a normal experience. It's just, that's normal.

It's respect, isn't it, for each other? Yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4831s)

Which, coming back to mine and hundreds of others in the Brethren, that respect for people lower down the scale is non-existent. It wasn't there.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4843s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well Gilly, thank you so much for coming on and talking so incredibly candidly about what you've been through. I think you've probably made all four of us well up at one point or other, you certainly have me. Just,  and I don't know if the answer will agree with me, but I think being able to talk so openly about it, I hope will encourage others to do the same and the more stories that you've been through of the abuse and then the depths of despair come out, I think the more healing can take place. And I'm particularly thinking of, we know,  that these podcasts are listened to people inside the Brethren and I know our friends that have been doing it in Canada and US, here in the UK and Sweden, what we want people inside to realize is these stories so they know what's happened and they know how people have fought through and that they know there is another, there's another way, that sounds really, that sounds really Brethrenly saying that, doesn't it? But you know what I mean, don't you?

### [**Ros Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4905s)

Yeah, sorry, we're all here for each other. We're all here for each other and if you want a sounding,  someone to sound off on. There's so many and that you will find an instant connection with and instantly can talk for hours and you're just comfortable with. And that's what I think as well it would be so helpful to anybody wanting to live. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4937s)

Don't be scared of the ex-Brethren community. I was.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4943s)

Yeah, I think...

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4945s)

We often have labels put on us, all of us collectively. But actually, I think if you're trying to leave with the ex-Brethren community, it's the one community where you don't have to explain things because we've all been through it. We've all had those feelings of, you know, having to adjust and everything so yeah, yeah, yeah. But John, thank you very, sorry, go on, I'm just going to say something.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=4971s)

No, I just, I just wanted to, I just wanted to, if it's okay, I just wanted to add one more thing about, you know, a couple of things actually. But the on the, on the subject of abuse, and I know it's not an easy subject for people to necessarily listen to or even people to talk about. But it's something that people who know this, who know my story and know, you know, know the subject of the abuse, they often ask,  you know, how can you talk about it? How can you, how can you look at pictures of your abuser? How can you have a family picture on your wall?

And the answer is, is it easy? No, absolutely not. It's not easy.

Do I really want to look at a picture of it? No.

And do I want to talk about it in that sense? In one sense, no. But I have a picture on the wall, a family picture on the wall, and I do talk about it because and it's there to say for, you know, to say to myself or to say to her, rather, "you're not going to win again." Yeah. You won, you won once. I'm not going to let you win again. You may have belittled me once, but not anymore. And I can look at that picture and I can talk about my situation and say, never again. You will not silence me by your threats. You will not shame me in silence.  I wasn't to blame, I wasn't at fault, and you're not, you're not going to pin that on me.  that is on you as the perpetrator and it's on you only.  and I refuse to let it shape who I am and who, who I will be. I won't let it weaken me,  and I'll use it to strengthen me and to fight for justice for everyone who's been through that situation.

And the other thing I just wanted to quickly say was about the, again, I know it's another sensitive subject, but it centers around the subject on suicide.

And this is more probably directed at people who are, who may be around people who are suicidal.

There's a lot that's often said about suicide and attempted suicide. There's the, "why would you do that?" "It's stupid." "It's a coward's way out." "How can you be so selfish?" "They're just attention seeking," et cetera.

But when someone is genuinely feeling suicidal, hearing these sorts of statements is the worst thing they can hear. And if you do know someone who's feeling that way, just be there for them. Don't judge them. Don't make judgmental comments. Don't tell them to pull themselves together. Don't tell them they're being selfish. And don't tell them they're being stupid.

Just be there. Listen. Be a listener. Try and encourage them to get help. Try and encourage them to reach out but most importantly don't make them feel worse for the way they're already feeling.

### [**Jackie Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5176s)

And I think that's, that's absolutely true and it's a good thing to remember, definitely a good thing to remember.

Yeah.

No, well, as I say, I think we'll wrap things up simply because of time.

Thinking of our listeners listening, but in all seriousness, Gilly, really applaud the journey you've taken and to get to this point in 10 years, where you can talk openly. I know it's not easy, we can see it's not easy for you but I think it's the same with anybody that can speak about these really difficult subjects that they've experienced. Bringing them out in the open will help others and I firmly, firmly believe that. Yeah, firmly, yeah.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5227s)

And I genuinely hope if I, if I can help one person out of the situation then it's worth it.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5233s)

Yeah, absolutely. Thank you Gilly for sharing.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5237s)

Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5238s)

Thank you very much.

### [**Gilly (John Gilliland)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5239s)

For having me on.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF6tONzGNcA&t=5239s)

Appreciate your time. Yeah, thank you, thank you so much.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848â€“1882) â€“ Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882â€“1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903â€“1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953â€“1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970â€“1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987â€“2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002â€“present)
