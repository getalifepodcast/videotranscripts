## Summary

In February 2009 The Preston Down Trust applied to the Charity Commission of England and Wales to renew its charitable status.
In June 2012 the Charity Commission rejected this application on the basis the doctrines and practices of the PBCC as practiced by the Trust did not meet the test for public benefit as set out in charity law. This resulted in a hearing being scheduled in the First Tier Tribunal so the courts could decide if the PBCC practices and doctrines met the legal threshold for charitable status. That hearing never went ahead.
Join us as we explore what happened as a result of the 2012 decision and unpick exactly what the Charity Commissions concerns were, especially in relation to the reports of detriment and harm resulting from the practices of the PBCC.
Regulators are there to give guidance about change and this is what the PBCC assured the Commission they were willing to undertake in order to retain their charitable status. The formal agreement for change happened in 2014.
But have the PBCC changed? Has the detriment and harm to both their members and ex members stopped? If you think not, we explain exactly what you can do about it to call for a review of the charitable status of the PBCC

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D7s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to the Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with my friends Anne, Ross, Abi, and Gilli, and we wanted to just delve a little bit deeper into what happened with the Charity Commission. I know there's been a podcast on there in the background but also some more recent updates and in particular about what people can do about it if they've got concerns.

The first thing I will say is I'm [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=37s) only one on this podcast that was not in the Brethren when the Charity Commission matter arose. So my friends will have a lot more first-hand knowledge than I will. But just to give a brief background, as most of you know, it all started back in 2009 when a particular Brethren Gospel Hall Trust, the Preston Down Trust, was refused charitable status.

And they were refused charitable status because of a change in the law in 2006 that said [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=69s) charity had to demonstrate they were there for public benefit. The Charity Commission had two principles of their public benefit test. The first principle was the benefit must be identifiable. And the second principle was the benefit must be for the public or for a sector of the public. And what they expressly said that that sector of the public couldn't just be for the members of that [charity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=99s)

So from then on in, we all know that the Brethren went on the offensive and did a huge campaign to overturn this decision, and the Preston Down Trust joined forces with the Horsforth Trust, which is up in Leeds, I believe, isn't it? Horsforth Trust, bearing in mind that it said in the Charity Commission's report all Brethren Gospel Hall Trusts would be implicated by this decision. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=129s) they kind of went on a huge offensive. So maybe if briefly somebody, just say what you remember about that. It's about 2011, 2012, from being in the Brethren, what you remember.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=144s)

There was weekly, one of the things that was started pretty much straight away was weekly emails with a link to a smartsheet, I think it was, where you had to document, there were four categories. I can't remember the categories off the top of my head, but there were four categories that they classed were of public benefit. One was giving to charity, one was preaching on the street corner, there were two other categories and you had to record what you'd done in terms of the past week that was sent around [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=174s) Monday, I think it was. So they'd got a record of what they'd been doing.

They also set up what they called PI days, which were Public Information event days, where they'd have a marquee in the car park of the local meeting room and invite the public to free food and to talk to members of the congregation. And a Bible. Yeah, and give them a Bible. They weren't allowed to, as far as I'm aware, they were always very [careful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=213s) about not letting them actually in the room.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=216s)

So these were held in the car parks in the marquee rather than actually coming to our church?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=222s)

Yeah, so it's not like a standard church where they're going, "Come in and have a look around." It would be a marquee with a catering setup and I remember being, you know, if you volunteered to help out you'd be selected to serve on a particular team. So you could be on the catering, you could be on the PR team, you could be doing car parking.

There were even young people walking around the local areas with like sandwich boards to, you know, to direct [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=252s) to the event. And then there was obviously the setup of RRT, the Rapid Relief Team or something like that, which basically was a team set up in every place where they would attend accidents, fires. To start with, it was more emergency events, but then I think it's progressed to public events such as handing out water at public races and stuff.

And they got, still to this day, the branding on that is huge. They've got marquee gazebos printed up. They've got trailers printed up with their name on it. All sorts of things that they do to try and demonstrate. And the sad thing is you speak to people who have been on the receiving end of these events or these helps, and they go, "Oh yeah, no, they were really kind, they were really generous." And it's like, yeah, if only you knew the meaning behind it. If you actually knew the true reason it's being done.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=330s)

Yes, and what else has been done in the form of their practices.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=335s)

Yeah, that was certainly one of the big things. But I mean, behind the scenes, there was all sorts being done. I can remember it being arranged for everybody to go to a Brethren's business premises after their evening meeting to have a presentation about what was being done and what was the update.

And you know, there were quotes from, there were quotes read out from various hierarchical people in the peeps, and one of the quotes I distinctly remember was from the top and that was about, he used the words, "Go for the underbelly," right, talking about you know, [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=383s) for the Charity Commission where they're vulnerable. So that's my memory of it. Obviously others have left more recently than me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=393s)

Is that sort of what you, Anne and Ross and Abi, you remember?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=397s)

Yeah, sorry, I would just, I did want to mention that before this time, we were forbidden to give to any charity.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=406s)

That's true.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=408s)

I mean, I remember as a child having to turn away and, you know, put my head the other way as I walked past anybody with the collection box. And even, you know, those little ones you used to see outside Woolworths or whatever, we were never allowed to put even anything in there because we were taught that that was joining with the world.

But that was the thing that struck me most when the whole Charity Commission thing came along was how all that just turned around in an instant, you know? And we were collecting for the British Heart Foundation and people were at the traffic lights with buckets, you know, as in Brethren women. And yeah, I didn't thankfully have to do it, but you know, you'd see women with their flowing hair and skirts flapping in the wind collecting money for whatever charity. And yet for, oh I don't know how many decades, we had never been allowed to [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=466s) in any way.

And suddenly it was so obvious, it was so obvious to me that it was just all a publicity stunt. And you know, it was honestly one of the further things that made me realize how wrong the system was.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=487s)

Yeah, and even the interaction of, you know, just having to do with people outside of the peebs. For years that had been, you know, frowned upon. All of a sudden you were, you know, you were interacting with them.

I can remember, it's just come back to me actually, one memory. We were, so I volunteered for the RRT at one point, and I can remember we were attending a fire in a big scrapyard in Birmingham. And so, you know, so we were there portraying this very generous image of, you know, feeding, giving people refreshments. Then we were instructed, well not me personally, but some of the team were instructed to go to the local Tesco and speak to the manager and see if they would donate the refreshments.

So here we are saying, "Oh yeah, we're giving you this food free," but actually on the other hand, we're trying to wangle it for free from the local supermarket. Yeah, of course. And another thing I remember is, going back [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=552s) the street preaching, we used to hand out tracts or pamphlets, and prior to this matter coming out, if you as a passerby had received one, you wouldn't have a clue who it came from. But when all this Charity Commission stuff started, we were instructed to stamp on the back with the local church trust details. So people, advertising.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=582s)

So what year would this have been approximately from your memory, roughly?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=587s)

From my memory it was more 2011 to when I left in 2013\. But I wasn't aware that it actually started back in 2009 to be honest, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=602s)

Yeah, I mean when you read through the full report, it was actually 2009 they called it into question and there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between the Brethren, the trust lawyers, and the Charity Commission lawyers. But that would kind of make sense because the Charity Commission were left with, they had to make the decision to refuse charitable status, and I think it was the back end of 2012 because they appealed it in June 2012\.

And then [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=632s) order for it to go to a first-tier tribunal for it to be debated. And what's interesting, their reasons for, and I'm reading this from their report about the whole business, it said the commission was not satisfied that access to religious services was sufficiently open to the public and thought that the religious doctrines and practices of the PBCC limited the engagement of Preston Down Trust with the community beyond the Brethren themselves [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=663s) had a limited beneficial impact on the wider community. So that was their reasons for turning it down.

They go on to say the Commission was also generally aware of allegations with regard to detriment and harm which might mitigate against any public benefit, but at that point had no direct evidence of it so that wasn't taken into their decision. What happened next for me, who was outside the Brethren's point of view, was amongst the ex-Brethren circles a lot of us submitted statements about the way we were treated.

And the commission went on to [collect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=700s), if you like, the detriment and harm. And why this was relevant, it's not actually, and I'm sounding devil's advocate in actually saying this, it's not actually unreasonable that, although we know it's hypocritical, that the Brethren should change their practices in order to be seen to be charitable. From a regulatory point of view, that is acceptable because that is the Charity Commission saying, "Look, if you want to keep your status, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=730s) going to have to do more." And if they do more, that's okay.

So although we all think it's very hypocritical, from a law and a regulatory point of view, that is okay. But then what came to light was the huge amount of harm and detriment they've done to people, which we all know about. And there is in law where it says, even if a charity is there for public benefit, if the harm and the detriment outweighs that public benefit, then they can't be a charity. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=760s) in a sense, the Charity Commission's decision changed, if you see what I mean, because they then had to consider the way the Brethren were and not just what they did for public benefit.

And what I wanted to do was actually, if I turned to page 19 of the report, is actually read out the concerns the Charity Commission directly raised with Preston Down Trust that worried them, because the Brethren have kept their charitable status on the basis that these concerns have been addressed. And yes, some thoughts on that would be good.

So the first one was the nature and the doctrines of the PBCC generally. That was their first concern. And they bullet-pointed that to say, "The imposition and control of strict codes of behavior pervading all aspects of life, restricting freedom of choice through a centralized and authoritative system."

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=827s)

That hasn't changed.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=832s)

I didn't think it had, Abi. The second one was...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=836s)

Yeah, go on. No, it's like they are getting more and more and more strict as time goes on.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=845s)

It's sort of letting go of certain things to show an outward thing, isn't there? But inside they're getting stricter, aren't they?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=855s)

Oh yeah, you can't even travel without putting a name on a piece of paper.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=859s)

I know that for a fact as well, Abi, now, that you have to actually ask for permission and fill in a form about why you want to travel. So for example, if you wanted to go and see your children in a different meeting, you can't just go over there and see them, you have to ask permission.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=876s)

Both ends. So you have to ask priests at your end and priests at their end.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=881s)

At their end. And I understand if you want to move house that couldn't be done without being sanctioned and you can only call it, sorry...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=890s)

You can only move to a certain area as well. You're not free to move exactly where you want to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=895s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=896s)

Relocation commission, that's it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=900s)

Yeah, yeah. And then I mean, we could go on at great length about this because we've seen it in our families, haven't we, the ones that are in there, how controlled their lives are and how little choice they have.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=912s)

I remember being told by my dad when I left that being born in the Brethren, you don't have a choice. Those were his words. Yeah, you do that full stop, you do not have a choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=927s)

Yeah, and as I say, as we read these out, and there are a few of them, the idea was, as I say, that the Faith in Practice document that the trusts adopted is mitigating against all this. The second one is the nature and impact of disciplinary practices. And then the bullet points are: variations in the practice of disciplinary action of an arbitrary nature subject to the judgment of the leaders in the assembly; harsh disciplinary [action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=958s) taken in relation to often minor deviation or transgression; physical separation of family members during the disciplinary processes with family members living separate lives with little or no contact, often leading to permanent divisions in families; detrimental impact on health and well-being of those subject to discipline and their family members; and lack of support and isolation from friends within the Brethren community. These were the Charity Commission's concerns between 2012 and [2014\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=988s)

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=989s)

They are all absolutely valid concerns. Yeah. Still current. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=999s)

More so, almost.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1002s)

In my experience, you're even separate in your own house when you were confined. You have your meals in your bedroom. You couldn't run in the house while your parents were there. So, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1013s)

They mentioned that in the detail of the report, Ross, how if a family member was confined. They had an independent expert, Dr. Eileen Barker, who is a knowledgeable professor in such things to do with sort of totalitarian groups, actually look at the practice of the Brethren. And she brought that up, how if you were confined, you were separated from your immediate... and we know that husbands are separated from wives, aren't they? And the harm that can cause. Yeah.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1040s)

So that's a disciplinary practice. Sorry, I'm helping quite a few people at the moment leave, yeah, and people are literally just left to it. Yeah, they're like, "Go on then, see how far you get." And they want you, they will try and set you up to fail. And some of the young people now that are leaving are some of the bravest, strongest people that I know.

And [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1073s) the Brethren don't realize that they're actually doing is they are giving these individuals ammunition to fight even harder and to be even stronger and be like, "No, you're not going to win. You've had enough control over my life. This is where it ends." And yeah, and you know, even family members are just like, "You've made your decision."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1098s)

Yeah, bye-bye. So from what we've seen between 2014, and I do pick that date because that was the year that all the trusts were supposed to have adopted and made the changes, so arguably before that they would say, "Oh, that's before we've changed."

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1115s)

No, so I thought, right, I thought inside the Brethren before I left that it had all changed. I fully believed it. They had a review, they had this, they had that. They had labels for different things where they would contact people that were wrongly shut up or wrongly withdrawn from and conversate with them and like try and offer, you know, [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1146s) kind of mediation to try and like lessen the wound of what they did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1152s)

I was on the receiving end of that. Were you? My husband, oh yeah, we had a little apology. Yeah, yes, yeah.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1158s)

Sorry, go on Abi. No, go on Ross. I was just going to say what you were saying before about young people leaving at the moment and, you know, basically being left to get on with it. I know this is probably jumping on a bit, but that is actually mentioned in the Deed of Variation anyway, that all help should be given.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1178s)

Yeah, it is. Because you're absolutely right, Ross, because what we're kind of going through now is the bits that they were concerned about. And then what's in the Deed of Variation is absolutely that. If someone wants to leave, they'll help and support them. Yeah, sorry, I'm jumping ahead. No, no, go. It's fine. It's not a problem. Not a problem at all. But you're right, they're supposed to have addressed these concerns and sorted them out effectively.

So that was disciplinary practices and then the next bit was the [impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1208s) and doctrines, sorry, excuse me, the impact of the doctrines and practices on those who leave the PBCC. So this was the Charity Commission's concern: The exclusory effect on family life and relationships where members leave as a result of complete severing of ties.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1227s)

Yes, well I can talk from very, very recent experience of someone that's very close to me who was really suffering with mental health and someone went to his father and said, "Look, this person needs you," and the father refused point blank to go and help this person. Yeah. And they literally, like even for us, I've got nephews that I've never seen. So you are completely, like I was talking to my husband about it the other day, they might as well have had a funeral for us.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1284s)

It's like a living death, isn't it?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1284s)

Yeah, and actually you have to go through a grieving process.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1288s)

That takes, it's actually harder to grieve for those who are alive. It's, you know, I believe for me that will never stop.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1302s)

No. I mean, on that score of that first sentence, Anne, I was going to say, when did you last hear from your children?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1309s)

Early 2018\. Yeah, very brief conversation just to tell my eldest that I was going to New Zealand.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1321s)

Yeah. So that leads into the next point that the Charity Commission was concerned about. And it said, "Where contact is made, this is infrequent and the quality of any contact and relationship is impoverished." And I mean, I experienced that with my brother, and I think we'd all say that, wouldn't we?

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1340s)

And I think to point out there as well, it's always us who are out that have to initiate contact. Yeah, they never do.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1348s)

Yeah, I did. I hadn't had any reply from my dad over the last few months because he does always reply to my emails, a very brief, well he has started to put "love Dad and Mom," which is good. But he hadn't replied since I sent the Father's Day. So I actually sent him a message just the other day and surprisingly he did reply. At their age, I'm not sure if they're [aware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1378s) of what they should and shouldn't be doing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1382s)

Yeah, that's something else we'll come on to. I don't think most of the Brethren are in many ways. The next point, and this is something you touched on, Abi, "Absence of assistance and support to those who leave, including vulnerable children and young people." Well, you've given first-hand evidence that that still is the case.

The next point they were concerned about, "Those who leave are ostracized and consequently treated differently from other members of the public." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1413s) I think that's a fair point. I think a Brethren member would be more friendly towards a never-Brethren member than an ex-Brethren member.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1421s)

Absolutely.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1423s)

I think a good case in point is a recent person we've had on the podcast. Her dad's funeral, there were about 600 people and most of them were non-Brethren. Yes, to his body, and she wasn't allowed.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1439s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Good point, Ross. Yeah, I think that's fair.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1445s)

Of course, their view on that is that, you know, these worldly people are ignorant and weren't out in the light, whereas we have turned our backs on the light, from the light. So we're massive sinners and evil.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1462s)

And worse sinners than they are.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1464s)

And we're, if I'm not necessarily insignificant, we're “wretched unfortunates that are consumed by our own wretchedness”. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Another example of what you've just said, Jacky, is my experience at the school where my child goes to. Yes. So there are mums there, I actually find it quite humorous to be honest.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1496s)

So just to clarify, this isn't a Brethren school at this stage, this is a mainstream state school?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1501s)

Yeah. And a couple of the parents in particular will talk to non-Brethren parents as if it's just like normal conversation. When it comes to me saying good morning or how are you or whatever I say, I am met completely blanked.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1526s)

You're blanked, absolutely.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1528s)

Blanked, yeah. And you know, at first it really hurt. And actually I got really crossed with one of the mums the other day because I said, "See you later," and she just pretended to be on her phone. And I said, "Excuse me, don't ignore me. There's no need to be rude." And then the next day I said, "Morning," and used her name and she did it again. She ignored me.

And I turned around and looked at her and she's just like, "What is your problem?" You have a problem. And I'm just [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1565s) good morning. Like, you can't even be polite. No, just because I've left your stupid cult or church or whatever you want to call it doesn't make me any less human. You can still be civil. Like you're meant to be the most Christian Christians in the whole world. You're God's chosen ones.

And yet when people choose to go on a different Christian path, because I'm still a Christian, I still go to church, when people choose to go on a different Christian path, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1596s) now a wretched unfortunate. And you're scum. Yeah, honestly, the way they look at me is like I'm just a piece of shit on the bottom of their shoe.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1610s)

I think that absolutely sums up, and that's a really simple little thing, but I think that absolutely sums up how we've seen and felt them treat ex-Brethren members.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1621s)

I remember because my two did still go to the Brethren school after, and I used to love actually going to the parents' evening until they insisted with the teachers that I had a different time because I would sit there, you know, in my trousers. Anyway, but there was one particular time where the teachers, what they witnessed, all of them came to me afterwards and said they couldn't believe it had happened.

And it was when they were introducing the self-learning thing and there was an actual meeting about it in the [assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1664s) hall. And I went there early to make sure I sat sort of in the middle of a row, you know. Usually all the parents came in and sat away from me, behind me. My brother didn't even sit next to me, so I was left in the middle of this row on my own. Not one of them spoke to me and afterwards, like I say, the head and two of the teachers came to me and said they were absolutely [disgusted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1695s) about how I was treated in that meeting.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1697s)

I think teachers are really beginning to realize what is happening. Yeah, like so many teachers are leaving, so many teachers are speaking out and there's not enough teachers for the kids. It's a good job they have got self-directed learning and Zoom because otherwise the...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1716s)

The Lord providing for them by giving, yeah.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1719s)

On that point, I remember when lockdown started, they were like, "We've had some of the biggest private schools in the world approach OneSchool because we've got SDL resources." And they gloated about it. Anyway, that's just a by the way, but yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1741s)

They were doing nothing new. They perhaps would just have done it before. It was nothing new, you know, nothing at all. The next point, I think, would you say a simple yes to "loss of social network and social isolation"? That was the next concern. I think that happens to all of us when we leave initially, doesn't it? And it's tough.

They were also concerned about "impact on finances where persons have been dependent on the Brethren for employment and mortgage." I'm sure we can [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1771s) cite cases where people have lost their jobs and income overnight. Yeah. Well, you were in that situation, weren't you? Or sorry, Abi, no, it's okay.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1781s)

Yeah, I'm in that situation now. Yeah, yeah, where I'm potentially going to lose everything. Yeah, and they knew, they knew when I left I couldn't work. So, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1799s)

Yeah. So we know that still happens. Because the reason I'm going through these is because then I want to look at what they've said they'll do to mitigate and we can say, well, are they doing it from our experience?

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1813s)

A lot of it also, the employment factor is something that is stopping hundreds of Brethren not to leave because like their wage levels are just unrealistic for what they're worth on the employment market.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1836s)

There wouldn't be a newly married person who works in sales that is on less than between 60 and 80 grand.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1853s)

Yeah. And it is a big, I mean, the fact of the matter is the bottom line there to me, and this is what I always say to somebody that's trying to leave, we all know what happens to your work when you leave the Brethren. But actually, your work and your faith are two totally separate things and one should not impact on the other. But it's very hard for somebody when they're inside to realize that. I mean, you had that, didn't you, Gilli? And you probably realize it now, but at the time you don't have the mental capacity [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1884s) fight that corner as well just to hold on to your job in the short term so you can get sorted, do you?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1888s)

But the other thing I want to point out on that is that what you've got in the peebs is people who are in jobs that they are completely not suited for. You know, I look back to my time in sales. If, you know, I've been out 10 years so I'm able to sort of analyze where mistakes that I've made. I was never really a salesperson, but I was shoehorned into that job and therefore when I left, that's what I continued to look for and then wondered why I failed at those jobs or, you know, got rid of, made redundant or whatever.

You know, because I was working for a company that could, being part of the peebs gave them extraordinary buying power. So most places I could go in and just sell on price if nothing else. And I think that's one of the things that really, really frustrates me is seeing people who leave want to go for the job they've been used to when in actual fact they're probably not actually suited to it and therefore struggle to, you know, to find their place in society because they're expecting for that job to work out.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1950s)

And lack of qualifications, because you don't get qualifications inside.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1963s)

Yeah, that was one of their concerns later on. You're absolutely right, Abi. The next one on this list was "loss of inheritance where relatives remain and leave their property to the Brethren, which is encouraged." That was one of their concerns.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=1978s)

Sorry, no, I was just going to say I know for a fact my grandparents had four children, two were in, two were out, and when they passed away the will was split between the two that were in. Yeah, okay, they didn't have a huge amount to give, but you know, didn't get a penny. No. And they weren't, I mean slightly aside, but they weren't even told that they'd passed away [until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2008s) after the funeral and that was on the advice of the elders.

Yeah, that happened to my gran on my paternal side. Basically my other brother that was out, and she was counseled, "Leave it to us grandkids so the brother couldn't get his hands on any of it." And again, he wasn't told about it. He had to find out about it himself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2033s)

Siblings do have a right to contest a will, but there's a very short time frame and I'm not actually sure what it is. They don't have years to contest it. So if your parents pass away and you get nothing and your siblings do, you can contest it and probably be successful, but it's quite expensive and there's a short time frame. Plus the fact, what I've heard is actually a lot of the time inheritance may be left to the Grace Trust or something like that and in which case none of the siblings get it because it's all left to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2063s) Brethren. But I don't know. Yeah, well it is.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2065s)

Yeah, it is. I've got, so before we left, because myself and my husband were traveling on business, we were sent wills because we were told we shouldn't have been traveling, so obviously something bad was going to happen. So we were sent draft wills to fill out and everything. For example, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2095s) direct that my burial should be under full control in every detail of the Brethren with whom I take the Lord's supper at the meeting room.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2105s)

Yeah, I've heard this happens.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2108s)

I appoint blah blah and blah blah to be guardians of my children during minority and I direct that my children shall continue to be brought up among the Brethren according to the Christian principles held among them. My executors shall hold the whole of my estate on trust either to remain or sell it on the following trust: to pay debts, inheritance tax and executor expenses, divide the residue equally among blah blah.

It's all about making sure you're tied in there, about making sure that everything that you own, including your children, if you own your children, kind of, is given to the Brethren. Nothing goes anywhere else. It's all designed like, oh, there's two different wills. One of them is a bit [simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2166s), but both of them refer to the Brethren. Yeah, it's tying you in basically.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2175s)

You weren't allowed to do it, was it?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2178s)

No, you couldn't go and get your own, what do they call them out here? I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2182s)

Yeah, yeah, you couldn't go and write your own, basically. No. And leading on from that, they were also concerned about the inability to participate in funeral arrangements and services of Brethren relatives. I think that's a bit hit and miss if I'm honest. I think sometimes some people are, sometimes there's point-blank refusal in my experience. I don't know so much about subsequent to 2014\.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2208s)

I can't prove it, but I sincerely think that my dad's burial was wangled so that I couldn't get there. Yeah, they changed the date. Well, they reckon that the gravediggers weren't available at the public cemetery where he was being buried. Remember you saying?

### [**Ross**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D2225s)

Yeah, no one's buried at public cemetery anymore, are they? Not now, okay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2236s)

It certainly sounds as if they didn't make it easy for you to attend your dad's burial, even if you wanted to. And that was how long ago? That was relatively recently.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2246s)

That was just before COVID.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2247s)

Yeah. And they certainly didn't phone you up and say, "This is the date and time, be nice to see you."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2253s)

No, no, no.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2256s)

They've got, like the meeting rooms with land have graveyards on them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2267s)

And so they're behind locked doors anyway, so you can't go.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2271s)

And visit. So if you want to go and visit your loved ones, you have to, you're not allowed to take flowers, all the gravestones are the same. You're not allowed to sit and mourn. There is someone there that will take you there, open the gates, let you in, wait till you come out, and then lock up. There's no sentimentality to it. That is their plan. You're not allowed to be sentimental about loved ones that you've lost.

And you know, in Coventry, there was a lady that lost her husband and she was pregnant with his third child at the time. And she went through so much. And like, I know if I lost a loved one like that or my husband like that, I'd literally sit on that grave for days and boo because I'm that kind of person. But she never got that opportunity. She couldn't just pop up whenever she wanted to because you can't do that.

The only reason I say about public graveyard is an ex-Brethren friend of mine who has now sadly deceased, her parents died just before my dad and they were actually buried in the public graveyard.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2349s)

If there isn't one near, sometimes they do, don't they?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2353s)

Yeah, and the other thing is I do know, and this is going back a long way, in the 60s the Brethren were very much encouraged to buy graves because my father bought one, and it could be that your friend's parents had a grave already.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2369s)

Yeah, but they only bought them in the late 2000s.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2374s)

Yeah, yeah. No, but my father, they bought them in the 60s though, and that, you keep, you buy them. So I don't know, I mean, I'm speculating that might be...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2385s)

I know that is the case with some of them where they've bought like doubles or triple graves.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2390s)

Yes, yeah, where you can...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2392s)

And there's still a space for the, you know, for the last remaining person. The person that I'm with at the moment, she just said that, so she was buried at one Brethren's meeting room and then they dug her up and moved her to somewhere else. Oh my goodness. There wasn't permission to bury her at that meeting room.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2417s)

Okay. So I think what we can conclude from that, although even if they are buried, that if they can, they will move them and bury them in the Brethren graveyard.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2425s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2425s)

So, the last two points, no not last two, there's about four or six more, but the last two are lumped together because this is quite a funny one that concerned, funny peculiar, concerned the Charity Commission: "Threats of legal action against those who speak out against the Brethren" and "fear and anxiety of repercussions for themselves and family members who remain in the Brethren." Do we think that still goes on?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2453s)

Yes, absolutely. I know so many people out here, ex-Brethren, that have some of the most damning stories, like heartbreaking, but they are so afraid of speaking out. A, because of what could happen to them potentially, because they still have family and children inside and they don't want anything to ever happen to them. Because let's be honest, us speaking out here, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2483s) stuff that's like being said about me that's gone round that is completely, completely, completely untrue. Like if I had children in there, I probably wouldn't have spoken out because the fear of what would have happened to those children. The bullying at the schools is just the most horrendous bullying that in my opinion exists.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2512s)

I actually agree and I actually think, I'm afraid the law profession has to be a little bit accountable here because I know of, in great detail, totally unnecessary cases that were taken out to try and silence an ex-member. And the cases didn't have a leg to stand on, but the stress and the fear it induced, it almost worked.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2539s)

Yeah, but that's their plan. That's their aim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought long and hard before I came on here.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2548s)

I know you did, Ross, you were very...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2551s)

I remember when I first spoke out in the Sunday Times, Jacky, you remember.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2560s)

Yes, I do. Back in 2015, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2562s)

My ex-brother-in-law phoned me up and said, "Oh, you know, you'll lose anything that you have with your kids." I haven't got anything. There's these little breadcrumbs that they give you to try and keep you quiet. Absolutely. They think that, you know, saying hello maybe to your child once a year is enough for you to keep quiet. No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2585s)

That's not a relationship. I have the same thing with my brother who's in, who has told me that he won't speak to me or doesn't want to speak to me because I'm so against the Brethren. But my comment back to that was that would be okay if we had a fantastic relationship for the 25 years I said absolutely nothing, which I did, I said nothing for 25 years. But we didn't. Nothing changed. You've just got an excuse to say it now.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2615s)

This is why I finally came on, because you know, I hadn't spoken out for nine, ten years. It's really empowering to be able to tell your story, what happened to you with no bullshit from the peebs. Nothing, no interjections. No, like I remember when I was telling my story inside and they were like, "But you have made mistakes before, haven't you, Abi? So maybe there's a mistake." No, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2645s) memory is, like the trauma in my memory is so ingrained that I don't have anything about what I went through wrong, thank you very freaking much. Who went through it, me or you? No, me. Don't try and question. So it's really empowering to be able to come onto a platform like this and actually tell your story. Definitely. I don't have any fear.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2667s)

Yeah, but there's a strength in numbers, isn't there? There's a strength in numbers and between, you know, there's been what, over 60 podcasts now. And there's a strength in the more people that speak out, the weaker their position to deny everything that goes on.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2685s)

And it's definitely rattling them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2687s)

Oh boy, I hope so.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2689s)

I think the fact that it's women that started it, no disrespect to you, Gilli, but I think the fact that it's women that started it, then they actually don't know what to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2703s)

I think you're right. Yeah, I think there's probably, yeah. Now, the last bit they were concerned about, this is the last little bit, and this doesn't even touch on the most serious issue because I don't think it was even known about then, "The impact of the doctrines and practices on children within the PBCC." The first bullet point is "limitation on educational activities for children, e.g. limitations on the use of technology and [censorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2733s) of materials within Brethren schools."

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2738s)

I probably am the only one on here that went to Brethren school, right? I did, I did, I did. You did, all right. Sorry, you know that much younger. So I went to, okay, I'm the most recent leaver on here then.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2759s)

My children went as well.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2762s)

Yeah. And I distinctly remember books like *Resistance* by Owen Shears. There is a relationship between one of the main female characters and one of the German soldiers, I think, from memory. This is like nearly 10 years ago now, so if my memory is wrong, sorry. And when they had sexual intercourse, that bit was either cut out or it had an edited version stuck over the top of it. And [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2805s) being a stupid teenager, I would like hold it up to the light and try and read through it, like, "What actually happened here, guys?" Because I know something did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2813s)

Yeah, I'm sure it still goes on.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2816s)

And no, because then when the Charity Commission stuff hit, there were no censor books, but then it went back. It went back like before. No, but definitely, because my mum, she used to be, she was an English teacher and she was the people that was approved to read them. You could read all the naughty books to say they were naughty.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2843s)

What a job\! It was brilliant. Respect to your mum, Ross.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2848s)

There was some, some were animals. It was mostly the women that were assigned to watch films and things to see if they were, would advise what bits should be cut out. And yet they got to watch them, you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2863s)

Yeah. So the next point they made, which I think we'd all agree, well, in my opinion, is the same, "Limited on social interaction with non-Brethren children within and outside the school environment." Well, those poor Brethren kids from the age of seven, who do they mix with?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2879s)

No one apart from Brethren. Even from under seven, actually. So there's children in my son's class and he's in preschool going into reception. And there are birthday invites sent out, like for the whole class, and they don't get them. They never go. Well, the parents in the class have kind of cottoned onto it and they're like, "Why waste an invite?" But then they're like, "Oh no, we must be kind."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2916s)

Do they still go home for their lunch?

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2917s)

No, they are segregated in a different corner.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2921s)

Okay, so they sit separately.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2923s)

I mean, I think when you're two upwards in preschool at the moment, there's one child that stays for lunch and the mum is pretty chilled out and she just lets the kid sit where...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2937s)

So when they're at school between, you know, preschool and up to the age of, I think it's first year junior, isn't it, seven years old, they go to a Brethren school?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2945s)

Yeah, it would probably be very similar to how it was when I was at school. And I went to a mainstream school, but I could not partake in anything. But I did have interaction with people at school, so I could talk to the other pupils there.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2961s)

Oh yeah, you can talk to them, but that's only at school.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=2964s)

Yeah, absolutely. You wouldn't interact outside. So I think we can safely say that that concern of limited interaction outside of Brethren schools is still the case.

The other thing, I'll lump these two together, the last two points they're concerned about with children: "The inability to attend university as the lifestyle conflicts with Brethren principles and practices" and "limited career opportunities due to restrictions on education and for girls who are expected to marry and have children." That's another concern of theirs that they put in the report.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3000s)

Well, what else are they expected to do other than that? Like, you have in Australia, because obviously I went to the Sydney school, their curriculum for girls are even more tailored than they are over here. So they would have dolls that would like cry and stuff and you'd take them home and the doll that cried the least and had all its needs met, you'd get a score.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3030s)

So they're grooming them for motherhood.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3033s)

Absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3033s)

And I think the biggest problem to me with that is actually what Gilli touched on earlier, that if you get somebody of any age leave the Brethren now, their education and career experience is so limited that, I mean, a lot of people that leave have to lower their expectations if they're looking for work. Would that be a fair thing to say compared to what they had in the Brethren?

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3061s)

Yeah, 100%. A point on that is, and I'm not, it's not a defense, but the extortionate wages that young married males get is to substitute because the wife's at home.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3078s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3080s)

So, you mentioned the figure of 60, 80 grand. That's actually the equivalent of a couple earning 30 grand each, which is unrealistic. But you get that into your brain that you are going to get a job that's paying 60 grand.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D3093s)

Yeah, which I don't have anything against, like the traditional roles. You know, that's what's, the man goes to work, the woman stays at home. But you've got to think, like there's only one female proper, proper business owner that I know in the whole of the Brethren system and that's called Zembr. And her business employs married or unmarried sisters [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3140s) do admin work for like random companies. And she married Owen Holder who lost his whole family in a really tragic, awful car accident back in what, 2000, and it was in Argentina, wasn't it?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3159s)

It's a long time ago.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3162s)

Yeah, ages ago. So she set up this business and she's the only female entrepreneur that I know in the whole of, in the whole... it's generally not encouraged, is it?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3175s)

I set up my own business.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3177s)

Yeah, you did. Yeah, yeah, you did.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3180s)

But in a sense that I was a bit, yeah, satisfied and they thought it would help my mental health.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3189s)

Oh, that you were allowed to do it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3192s)

I'm part employed, I did have part-time young sisters working for me, but my uncle supplied me with premises.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3203s)

In a sense, something like that. But it's more, I think what they were, is because your sphere of knowledge, worldly wise knowledge is so limited in the work field because your employment opportunities, as Gilli said, you're shoehorned into a role that may not be suited to you. I mean, what would happen if you really wanted to be a nurse? It couldn't happen.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3234s)

I've got some things that Bruce Hales has said about universities. He said that there are persons that have gone to university as Christians and come out as infidels because of the power of a wrong mind and a faulty mind. He said "University education narrows you, so that's why we can say to people we don't need to go to university because we want to retain a broad outlook. We don't want to be narrowed up like you are. We want to be broad."

"Brethren in the main [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3265s) universities 40 years ago," and he said that in 2007\. "So the Brethren have moved forward. It's really a fellowship to go to university full-time enrolled there. That's another fellowship. That's the way I see it. So if I want to be in this fellowship, I can't be in that fellowship. Learned people that have been to university and they've come up under certain professors and these professors have had a great influence on them, even molded their thinking. It could have changed [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3295s) from thinking a Christian way." And then he says, "The idea of going to a university, it would be leading into the place of a skull," which is a scriptural reference.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3308s)

Basically, they don't approve of university. No, no, which we know. And I'll come on to what they told the Charity Commission they do about higher education in a moment. So having looked at all those areas they were particularly concerned about and had evidence of, I'll precis what they said.

They put them all to the Preston Down Trust. And the Preston Down Trust, they indicated that some of the allegations were of a [historic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3338s) nature, but they did acknowledge that past mistakes in relation to its disciplinary practices. So this would be about 2013\. They further demonstrated willingness to make amends for these and to do what they could as a Christian organization to ensure, as far as it was consistent with its religious belief, it would act with Christian compassion in the future, particularly in its dealings with the disciplinary practices and in its relationships with former [members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3368s) of the Brethren.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3370s)

My husband's and Gilli's uncle. Yeah. Yeah. So they had like a sorry session. Yeah. And my husband's parents invited, so it's his mum's brother. Yeah, and they invited him over every Saturday evening, from memory it was one evening of the week anyway, and it happened, I think it was three times off the top of my head.

And then the priest clamped down on it and said that this isn't right. And that evening, the other brother was coming over from Germany and he was halfway over here and they rang him [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3426s) they said, "Sorry, you can't come anymore because the priests have said that it's not right and we're breaking down separation." And that was it. They never saw him again. And my husband has vivid memories of that and the memories tie up with his uncle's, and that's what happened. So they had their sorry sessions, but they meant absolutely nothing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3453s)

Unless you were prepared to go back, that was all they were about. Yes. When it started getting out of hand, John Hales...

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3465s)

There was a couple in Peterborough, he used to have there, he was out, he used to come over every Saturday. And as soon as the priest knew that basically he wasn't wanting to come back, it was shut right down.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3478s)

Okay, so it still happens. And the Commission concluded that, they said they considered there is enough evidence to support the view that there are elements of detriment and harm which are in real danger of outweighing public benefit, although it did acknowledge these haven't been tested under cross-examination. The next interesting sentence I thought, "The most serious detriment and harm related, in the Commission's view, to the allegations of the treatment of [ex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3508s)\-Brethren and to the disciplinary practices. The Commission asked the PBCC to address these issues, which they were willing to do so." On paper.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3525s)

This is how they've drawn their conclusion. No, I mean, the Brethren would have been willing to do so on paper. They would, I think they actually did it is another thing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3536s)

What they're now, sorry, what they've done is they know they've turned it around and tried to say it's the individual's choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3545s)

They have.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3546s)

How can we overcome that? Because we know that it's not the individual's choice. You know, I only have to read that message of my youngest Oscar's text to somebody who was in at the time where he says, "I love her and I know she loves me. I didn't want to leave her, but I was torn because she was against Bruce Hales."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3575s)

Yeah, I don't know the answer to that question, Anne. But what I do think is if anybody in the Brethren watches these podcasts, well, please do watch them. They do, you do have a choice. And because of this document, you can make that choice to get in touch with your family outside and there is actually nothing the Brethren can do about it. And if enough people inside know that, they...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3604s)

Can do something about it. And this is the problem, Jacky. They absolutely annihilate you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3609s)

And I'd love to hear from you. Yeah, but if enough people do it, so it's not an isolated incident, eventually it could change. I'll tell you why I say that. Maybe I'm an optimist, I've been told that. I personally am trying to take the Brethren's charitable status away. I wish I had that power. I don't. Okay. There's no way.

It's not a case of trying to take their charitable status away if they behave, if they've agreed to behave. The problem we have as ex-members is there's, as we've said, this agreement on paper, and we'll go through the points that they've agreed to mitigate against all those things the Commission were concerned about, and they're carrying on as if it didn't happen. So our job in a sense is to try and, it will be slow going, to empower those inside to be strong enough [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3663s) actually enforce it. Now I agree, they do at this point, Abi, I know if they do that, you get into trouble for contacting somebody. But fear can be broken down. I believe that with enough force, fear can be broken down.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3678s)

Is this a good point to bring in, members actually don't know about this document because they've not been given a copy? Well, that was another thing. I thought everyone was meant, every household was meant to have a signed copy. Well, we never have. Not every household, every person over the age of 18 was supposed to have an individual copy. No, I never saw it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3704s)

And to keep it. So I can tell you now that this was a concern raised with the Commission at the time, is that the trustees will agree to the changes written in the deed of variation that they adopt, but the Brethren wouldn't know about it. So your children, Anne, and all the rest of our families wouldn't know that actually they are allowed to contact us.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3726s)

I'll put it this way, by the time I left, as far as I know, my dad and mum didn't know what was actually contained in the document. No, that was 2014\.

### [**Abi**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D3735s)

But I think a really big point to make here is that you are indoctrinated to think that you can't, that you don't have a choice and you can't contact people. And it's not just a document that's going to undo that indoctrination because it's put into your [heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3756s), it's put into your mind, it's put into your soul that these people that have left are evil and they're against God and they're against Bruce Hales and they're against Christ.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3765s)

So that comes on to the other argument we could use, the other way we could approach it in a moment. But I do know what they did to mitigate that problem was, I don't know if it was every meeting, I think it was, that the document was actually read out in the meeting. And I know for a fact that it was handed to every male over 18 as they walked into the meeting room. The deed of variation was read out and it was said at the end of the meeting they have to hand the document back. And I think that happened and then [basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3796s) probably most of the Brethren kind of thought the Charity Commission matter's sorted and carried on.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3804s)

And also, you know, how do you retain the information in a short amount of time? You don't. No, you can't do it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3812s)

That whole document couldn't have been read anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3815s)

Yeah, I think they probably just read out the faith in practice bit, which was the added bit to the deeds. And they had to do that in order, because legally, they have to incorporate it and the trustees and the congregation have to agree to it. But that's their way of doing it. But I think you're absolutely right, Abi, that the majority of people in the Brethren are not aware of the content of this document. Hopefully if they listen to this podcast, they might be a bit more aware of it afterwards.

The document, I [agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3845s), it's an indoctrination that's in your heart and your head from birth, but the document is the closest thing to any accountability that we've got at the moment, really.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3857s)

Do you think there needs to be like a review with the Charity Commission? Is that something the Charity Commission would actually entertain, do you think?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3868s)

I mean, we're more than 10 years down the line now.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3872s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at the amount of sexual abuse cases that have come out since then. Look at the amount of domestic abuse cases that have come out since then. It illustrates the serious, serious harm that is happening inside there. And just because there's a beautiful, flash red RRT sign in front of, you know, a bushfire-scoured background doesn't mean that they're charitable.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3909s)

At all. No, no. There's two ways. I think the first way I've mentioned is about trying to get people inside to realize they do have a choice. But I do totally accept that is a difficult road to climb because of the mindset when you're in. I was there myself. The second way is a review. But the only way the Charity Commission, they're a regulatory body. A regulatory body won't investigate because somebody [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3939s) something's happening. They need hard evidence.

It's clear, and that evidence needs to be tried in a high court. And the Charity Commission, so if you were to raise a concern with the Charity Commission, we can put the link on the podcast in the chat bit of it. There's a specific form that you need to use, or you can just Google "raise a [concern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=3964s) about a charity." And there's instructions on the sorts of things they will investigate.

And I will just read them out, there's only six or seven of them, because we can then sort of perhaps realize where we think how the Brethren behave comes. So the first one is, "A charity not following the law with serious damaging consequences to its reputation and public trust in charities generally." I think it'd be fair to say they're not doing illegal things in the Charity Commission's eyes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4005s)

But yeah, but they will separate themselves from that. How do we get over that? Because they'll say that those cases, they don't agree with that. So how, you know, they'll say that's nothing to do with us. But what's underlying all that, we talked about this with Jeremy, underlying it is that the PBCC are producing people that are so badly damaged in lots of ways that they are doing bad things. But how do we, it's so difficult.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4046s)

It is very difficult. I think the category most of what we talk about would come into for something they would investigate is, "Serious harm to the people the charity helps or other people who come in contact with the charity through its work." And I think that that kind of encompasses... but what you'd have to do, it would need to be, it can't be one person sending in lots of stories. It has to be everybody motivated to send in what has happened to them.

And it's also quite hard when you report something like this because it cannot be emotive. It has to be, "This is what happened to me." Despite them saying, I mean, if you use, you mentioned, Abi, that, you know, some recent leavers that have been given absolutely no help at all. So the facts are here is this person who, or people, whoever they might be, who were left with barely the shirt they were wearing on their back. And yet you have agreed to financially help and support anyone who chooses to leave. So that's the kind of factual...

The other slight problem with reporting, you can't report [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4123s) PBCC because the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is not a registered charity. It's a business. It's a limited company. Says it all, doesn't it? It does, really. So you have to actually report the individual Gospel Hall Trust that that person came from. So for example, you came from Coventry, Abi, and I came from Luton, and Anne was from, you know, Warrenpoint. It would have to be people reporting each individual [trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4153s). That would then help the Charity Commission to realize, "Ah, actually these all come under the same church." But you have to report each individual trust.

Now that's what I said is quite a minefield because it would be easy to say I came from the meeting of Luton, therefore it's the Luton Gospel Hall Trust. It isn't. They have obscure names.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4175s)

The most bizarre names.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4177s)

Yeah, yeah. What, even if it's Preston Down? I couldn't even tell you what that was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4181s)

Oh, it's a town in Devon. I mean, but it's nothing, yeah. So you have to, you know, get them.vThey've made it that way. Come on, I suspect they probably have.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4190s)

Yes. In Peterborough, we had the Welland Trust and the Cavendish Trust. Well, you know, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4197s)

Yeah. So, and you, and every trust is publicly listed on the Charity Commission website. So you could go on to the trust of the meeting you came from, the trustees are there, and the contact details are there.

### [**Ross**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D4210s)

Thank you. But the thing is, it makes them even more a minefield because they have separate trusts for not just their main hall, they have separate trusts for all the subdivision as well. So there's more than one trust per locality. Yes. Right. Yeah. And also I'd be really wary because you know you're going to get a knock on the door from them people, from those trustees. You know that you are.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4288s)

You probably wouldn't. As in, if, how it would work, if then you filled in this form and you reported the ex-Gospel Hall Trust and this was my concern: "I tried to leave and I was given no support and they forbid me to speak to my mother," or whatever has happened. And, "I believe this is in breach of what the trustees..." Bear in mind the report says the faith in practice document where they agreed to help people that leave and to [keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4318s) up relationships with ex-members, they've also said is legally binding on the trustees. So they are legally bound.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4327s)

So there's going to be people going to jail then?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4328s)

Well, I don't know if it'd go that far, but I am 99% certain that a letter from the Charity Commission to a trustee saying, "I am concerned about what I've heard, can I hear your side of the story?" would make them move.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4347s)

A lot of trustees resigning.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4349s)

You'd have a lot of trustee changes. But that's the thing, and they'll just get someone new in. But they can't, Abi, because they have to be accountable to the Charity Commission. So actually, it would be the trust, you know, if they suddenly have a complaint and three of the trustees resign, the three come in, the regulatory body would see that as suspicious.

But what it needs is enough people to feel strongly enough to report their stories to the Charity Commission, which they can do through the website. And I think if there were enough, there is already [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4383s) a lot on file. This has gone on file because I know lots of people have reported incidents and they've kept it on file. And the more that goes on there, the more the Charity Commission will be pressured into looking at this and to see whether the PBCC really have changed as they assured the Charity Commission they would back in 2014\.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4408s)

Would I be able to use like that message of Oscar's?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4415s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4416s)

Say the letter from Natasha that I got in 2017 which is very clear why she can't have anything to do with me. Yeah. Can I use those?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4427s)

Yeah, because as a regulator, they like hard evidence. So it's actually better you do use those things because then they've got things. You can always anonymize them if you don't want your son's name in it, but they actually prefer hard evidence like that because the letter and the text message, you can't deny you received that. That's actual evidence.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4453s)

And I think, what about the emails I sent to my mum? Could I use them? It depends what they say, Ross, because that's the sort of thing they want. Yeah, go on. Obviously I referenced about her not even giving me a kiss.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4470s)

Yes.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4471s)

Because it would be a breach of the testimony.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4473s)

Yeah. And whenever I spoke out in 2018, whatever it was, and I mentioned some of the words out of that letter of Natasha's, I mean, they turned around, well first of all they assigned her a lawyer and then on top of that they got her to tell lies about me to say that that wasn't why she left home. Even though it's in the letter. But you know, she came back to the journalist with all this rubbish.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4510s)

Yeah. Well this is the thing, they've got so much money.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4513s)

Same with my son, they said that as well about, yeah, I was a gambler and I was this and I was that. Yeah. I wasn't a gambler, I'm so funny.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4524s)

Yeah. And the other thing that is sometimes helpful is if you were wanting to raise a concern, is that you stipulate why you think the trustees are in breach of that document. So for example, I've just got some of the things they agreed here. Let's pick the obvious one about helping people that leave. I'm just scrolling down [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4557s).

Here we go. So what they put in this document: "Where persons seek to leave the community, reasonable assistance should be afforded to them in terms of support and/or financial assistance relating to employment and other matters where they have been dependent on the community for that support." So in other words, if you've got a situation where that hasn't happened, you actually directly relate it to that and say, "You know, this person left and there is no way that [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4587s) happened, and I believe it's in breach of that document."

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4592s)

And how about if it happened but it was the actual family that had to cough up rather than the Brethren themselves?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4598s)

I don't know is the answer to that because they would probably argue, "Well, we did try and help."

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4604s)

Yeah, that clause, that clause was put to my brother. That very clause, his reply to the person who sent it to him was, "You've taken the words out of context." Yeah, yeah. How can you take it out of context? It's quite clear.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4623s)

You can't. I mean, and this is why we need somebody independent of us and Brethren, because let's face it, we've all got a bias because we've all got our stories, haven't we? To review it, somebody independent needs to look at it and make that decision.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4640s)

Can I just quickly say, Jacky, that the person I'm with at the moment sent this document that we're talking about to the priest and the family.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4652s)

We'll wait for Abi to come back. The other one I wanted to read out while we are still recording is regarding family relationships. She'll come back in. And it says, "Reasonable steps should also be taken in these cases, consistent with and subject to any legal requirements applying to the persons involved and the human rights of any persons involved, to allow the continuation of family relationships where a family [member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4682s) has left the community, including providing access to family members, in particular children."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4689s)

And it doesn't say how old the children are either.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4694s)

It doesn't. Now, somebody said earlier the caveat they've put in is that all of these things are each Brethren member's individual choice. And I'm paraphrasing now because I can't find the paragraph. And they make that choice based on their knowledge of the scriptures and the recent ministries.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4715s)

Yeah, so that's important. Because that then links it. They are making a choice based on, yeah, they are not making a choice.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4727s)

No, they're not. They're not linking to, yes, they're not making a choice of their own free will. It is based on something else.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4737s)

I think in approaching, like in doing anything like this towards the Charity Commission, I think it's important, like as you say, Jacky, that it's not about taking away their charitable status. No. What we want, what they can't seem to, what the Brethren can't seem to realize, those at the top, can't seem to realize is if they only let us live and be with those we love. We're not asking more than that.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4769s)

No, totally. I really, really need my mum at the moment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4776s)

Yeah, totally, Ross. And this is what, you know, the Brethren have got some, in a lot of people's opinion, some funny rules and regulations, but actually they're quite entitled to have those. We live in a world where we have religious freedom. If they choose not to eat and drink with anybody, I can live with that. It doesn't bother me not to have a cup of tea with my family. But to have them not speak to you and to have them cut you out, that's not right.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4808s)

The problem there is we know from recent evidence that the person at the top has actually gone so brave and so brazen about it that they have publicly said in their published printings that Brethren shouldn't be having anything to do with anyone who's left, which is in direct breach of the agreement. But the problem we have is that [they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4839s) got so confident that no one's going to do anything about it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4843s)

If your child read in black and white, or if any of our loved ones read in black and white, "You'll be better to take rat poison or cyanide rather than have contact with us," how can you, you cannot blame... that means they don't have a choice. No, they don't feel you like that was taken out of context. It's there in black and white. There's nothing to take out of context.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4873s)

No, no, I agree. And I think that's probably the sort of purpose of why we wanted to actually talk about this on a podcast. Is because if we can tell people that have got stories as to how they can perhaps effect change. If the Charity Commission realized that, in a word, the Brethren are not sticking to what they agreed.

We actually met with the Charity Commission in 2015 and as a regulator, they told us [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4903s) they would rather encourage a charity to change than take away their status. And I get that. Taking away the status has huge legal implications. But what they've done essentially, they've accepted that the Brethren have said they've changed, but to everybody that's tried to leave or have contact with families since 2014, nothing has changed. Nothing. And they only have to make those changes.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4930s)

Yeah. And there was even an MP who was in favor, who was against the Commission's ruling at the time, that said to the Charity Commission, "You've allowed yourselves to be paid out because of how much money the Peebs were throwing at it." And you know, the Charity Commission, if you look at it from their point of view, they're a regulatory body. They don't have unlimited resources to fight something like that when you look at the millions that were thrown at it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4959s)

Yeah, they're also a publicly funded body. They're funded by the government. And in the report, when it talks about it not going to court and why they made this agreement, they said they took into account that they have to be careful about how they spend public money and a high court case would have cost the public a lot of money.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4980s)

They've only got a certain budget for the year and they can't be seen to spend it all on one particular challenge, can they? No. Because they would have to actually do that. Yeah. Because look at the money that the Brethren can put into it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=4992s)

I mean, the concerns they had and the evidence the Charity Commission had in 2014 was due to go to the High Court in January 2014 and this agreement was adopted like four or five days before and the High Court case was canceled. It was that close to the wire.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5011s)

But that's a very typical high-level lawyer. So in my sexual abuse case, it was ready to go to trial. And then all of a sudden, right at that last minute, they put guilty pleas in. It's a very clever, manipulative move, which only really high-end, high-cost lawyers will be prepared to do. But then it saves them a trial because ultimately at the trial, let's be honest, they wouldn't have got [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5050s) charitable status.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5054s)

I think you're going to be very close.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5054s)

Yeah, they were having prayer meetings like every, I think at the, like when it got hot, like the fire was hot, it was like before every meeting they would have like a special Charity Commission matter.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5070s)

Like the one they have every Wednesday by us.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5075s)

Yes, I feel so privileged. Oh yeah, oh, important. Yes, this podcast and our stories are having more of an impact than I think even they realize.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5091s)

Yeah. So well, that's what I hope. And I hope as a result of this one tonight and our discussions, if they reach people inside the Brethren, they may not, they may feel they can't act, and I understand that. I do get the mindset. Although it'd be lovely if they could, I do get it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D5108s)

Me too, because I've been in that mindset.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D5111s)

Yeah, so have I, a long time ago. Not long ago, you know, we wouldn't have dared contact.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5120s)

And we all knew that that charity, the RRT, was set up because everyone knows that. There is no denying that. Anyone in that does not know that, unfortunately.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5136s)

Yeah, the motives were not genuine. And unfortunately, that was also addressed in the report because what the Commission said about that, it, they said it was suggested to them that the motives behind it were purely to retain charitable status. But unfortunately, the Commission can't judge on motive. They can only judge on evidence. And at the time, the evidence was they were, there was evidence of ongoing wider participation [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5167s) the wider community. Well, there is now.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5170s)

There is because look at all the like fancy Facebook posts and the social media posts and the like meeting the Prime Minister. And like I remember when that happened at Grenfell and there was like an email sent around afterwards that under no circumstances those photographs of Boris Johnson shaking, oh, some, I think it was, it was potentially Glenn Stacy, shaking his hand, because it could be used. Well, of course it could be freaking used. Like we all know why that happened. It wasn't just, "Oh, he walked past our tent."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5211s)

Whatever we think about the charity the Brethren do and the motives and the falseness of it, and I believe all of that is there, from the Commission's point of view, that probably evidences they are there for public benefit. But what they don't address is the harm and detriment that's going on in the background. And that's the other aspect. If the harm they cause to people inside the Brethren and to those that leave outweighs the public benefit, which is where they [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5241s) at in 2012, at the end of 2012, beginning of 2012, sorry, they, even though they do that public benefit, they still...

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5250s)

I'm not sure if it outweighs. I'm not sure if it outweighs because you look at the handful, even though the handful's getting bigger, of people that leave. Like there's at least one trailer in every locality in the world. And on outreach, they'd be reaching, you know, if it was a big event, they'd be reaching thousands of people. Like for example, they keep like handing out bottles of water at [marathons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5280s). Like think of how many people would run a marathon compared to how many leavers there are.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5288s)

But what about the whole thing of their churches not being open for the public?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5295s)

Well, that's another issue we haven't even touched on that one because that's not...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5301s)

A big one. Because is that not the reason why churches get charity status? Is because they're like a place of refuge for the public?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5316s)

Yes, they're a place of public religious worship.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5317s)

In the Preston Down Trust, it states: "One, the services of worship conducted in each gospel hall included in the property of the trust (other than the Lord's supper and services convened for a particular family or by a visiting elder, minister, servant or evangelist for the benefit of a congregation gathering by way of special invitation) should be open to all properly disposed persons who wish to be present and observe such worship."

"Properly disposed persons are members of the public, whether [members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5347s) of the Brethren or not, who: one, respect the gospel hall as a sacred place; two, do not threaten the safety or privacy of the assembly; and three, come to the service in a spirit of gravity, genuinely wishing to learn from the teachings that are given there."

"Two, we should ensure that a gospel hall in every locality displays prominently outside its premises a sign indicating how persons from outside the community, including former Brethren, can attend a hall for worship."

"Three, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5377s) should offer to people who attend our gospel halls for worship from outside the community, including former brethren, the opportunity to better understand our faith and services through literature or in person."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5389s)

That again was something they touched on. I didn't really touch on it because there were quite a few points, but they said about that, I'd have to find the paragraphs and it would take me a while to scroll, that they were aware they had security gates and so on, but there was evidence that they were changing the signage.

### [**Ross**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D5405s)

And that they are changing too. Yeah, let me grab my phone because I took a...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DyeaIkp9S6Vw%26t%3D5412s)

But with the detriment and harm, I think the [point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5419s) is, in 2012, the Charity Commission decided the detriment and harm, on the basis of the evidence they had, albeit it wasn't tested in a high court, did outweigh the public benefit. Therefore, the Brethren had to change.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5439s)

Yes. So in my opinion, I think that's already there. It's already, yes, they've already proven that it outweighs.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5445s)

Yes. Well, they, in their opinion, they said it outweighed the public benefit because of all these things that happened. They were a closed community and so on. But it didn't go to high court to be tried under oath and all that sort of thing because they obviously agreed to a settlement.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5463s)

Yeah, and that was after the RRT was set up?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5466s)

It would be about the time it was being set up, yeah.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5470s)

The sign says "Plymouth Brethren Christian Church" in great big writing and then it's got the website address and a phone number. It says, "Place of public..." really, I can't help laughing at it, like, what bullshit. "Registered pursuant to Place of Worship blah blah Act thing. For details of gospel preachings and meetings for Bible teaching, please contact the above number," which is an [0208](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5500s) number. So for this particular place, it's not a local number. London, isn't it?

And then, "A gospel preaching for visitors to attend will be held on Sundays and street preachings are held on weekdays." So the only day you're allowed to go, technically, that we knew as Brethren, is we may have people come to the five o'clock. And then underneath it says, and this is what angers me...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5531s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to be...

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5533s)

"All well-disposed persons are welcome to attend." Now, the church that I'm so privileged to go to now, there's people with tattoos, there's people with caps on back to front. Like, no one gives a shit what you are wearing. We are there to hear about Jesus.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5555s)

That's an open church. And that's, I thought what the whole, that's why we get charity...

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5562s)

And I know this is going off on a tangent, but not only are their churches not places of public worship, their graveyards aren't public either, whereas a normal graveyard, even in a church, is a public place.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5575s)

So out of interest, I looked up today actually, because I was thinking about this, what a well-disposed person was. And the dictionary definition, if we want to be totally pedantic, if you're a well-disposed person, it means having a positive, sympathetic, or friendly attitude towards someone or something. Wow. Yeah, that's what it means. We go in with a positive, friendly, and well, you know, attitude.

I found the [paragraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5605s) where they've said about the churches and because it is an interesting point, I'll precis it a little bit. "The evidence showed PBCC meeting halls are protected by fences and gates which the PBCC say is for security reasons. The signage outside the PBCC meeting halls identifies them as public places of worship and provides contact details. It was noted the PBCC are in the process of changing their signage to [provide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5635s) more information."

"There is evidence that people are spoken to by PBCC members to assess whether they are genuinely well-disposed members of the public before entry to the meeting halls is permitted. All services are open to non-members except Holy Communion services which are restricted to PBCC members." Not true.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5661s)

So, am I right in thinking that in a normal, I say normal, church, Holy Communion, anybody can go? Yeah. Yes. Yes. In our church, in the preamble, they invite you to partake in the Lord's Supper and they refer to scripture that you believe in the Lord and you believe that he's going to, I can't remember exactly what they say, but that you're a Christian basically to be able to partake in the Lord's supper.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5699s)

In the Church of England, it's left, and most other churches, Methodist churches, left entirely up to you. They do sometimes say if you've been christened and confirmed, they'd prefer that. But actually, you can go up and receive the bread and wine. And if you don't want to, the symbol is you take your hymn book with you or something and they give you a blessing. And that's pretty standard.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5721s)

But you can go into the service. Yes, you can still go into the service.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5725s)

Oh yeah, yeah. And you can go into the service and not go up.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5730s)

Yeah, I remember when I was, I can't remember where I was, local, but there was a husband or, I don't even know if they were husband or wife, a couple that came to one of the gospel preachings. And firstly, there was an announcement to say that Bruce Hales's name must not be brought into the gospel preaching, which it had to be said because he was part of the gospel, so they had to take that bit out. And the preachers actually really freaking struggled. They couldn't actually preach a genuine gospel.

And then the poor lady, it was the first and only time they ever went, someone had tried to put a headscarf on her with like the stuffing, whatever they call that material that goes underneath to make it puffy, and the headscarf was like this. [Okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5788s), so like everyone collapsed into laughing when she came in. And even I did, I'll be honest, even I laughed. But now I look back and I just think, how freaking humiliating. I don't think she'd go back, would she? No, she never went back.

But there was, when I lived in Sydney, someone died and their family that were out of fellowship went to that burial. And they like, it's obviously a different rule for Sydney, but they actually just sat all together, like in the, and like there were sisters behind them and [brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5841s) in front of them. So maybe it's like a different rule for different places. Maybe where it's more under the spotlight like Sydney, they have to like not try and be as strict and segregated as they usually would be.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5859s)

The point is you can't, you cannot just walk into one of them. No, you can't.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5865s)

And I have no problem if I were to go to a Brethren meeting with putting a headscarf on. Shall we? Yeah, shall we? Shall we all go?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5874s)

No, never. I have nightmares about sitting in one of them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5879s)

But I would have no problem with dressing as they would expect me to dress because if I walked into a Sikh temple, I would cover my head. Well, I'd wear a skirt, Abi. We're not there to ridicule that side of it. It's the point that their places are not public religious worship. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5909s) I actually have, this is a whole other discussion, but I actually have grave concerns about some of the things that are said behind those locked doors in a place of religious worship. But that's a whole other discussion.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5921s)

I think we'll have a podcast about that. Yeah, it's going to be a long one, that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5929s)

But I think I want to say thank you very much, everybody. And the message I want to leave, and I think you would agree with me, we are not here with the sole aim of taking away their charitable status. We are here with holding them accountable to keeping it. And we can't do that, but the Charity Commission can. But the Charity Commission only can if they've got the evidence that they are not keeping to the behavior they agreed with the Charity Commission.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5959s) what we'll do is we'll put the link to the form that you can fill, you know, raising a concern, and then people can make their own decisions and do what they feel comfortable with. I don't know if anyone else wants to add anything to that.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=5970s)

I would. I'd just like to say that we are being called the attackers, the opposers, the people that are trying to do this and that and the other. And I'll finish with my spiel with this quote: "Accountability feels like an attack when you're not ready to acknowledge how your behavior harms others." So they think we're attacking them. No, actually, you're just not [prepared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=6000s) to accept accountability for what you've done to us. They could just come and talk to us.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=6007s)

No, that's really, that's good, Abi, and it is true. We're still the same people that we were, well, you know, we're still the same people we were when we were in there. As in, you know, we're just normal people. Well, I mean, they're not normal, probably, but you know what I mean. We are, we're human.

### [**Abi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=6032s)

No, I think we could say, I think that's absolutely right, Abi. It feels like an attack because they're not prepared to square up to what's happening and that's the bottom line. So it feels like an attack, but in fact, it isn't an attack. It's effectively to try and stop the harm that we all see going on through trying to help people leave and from the stories we hear and from our own hurt.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=6055s)

Yeah, and it's not just us who's hurting. No, those in there are hurting too. And in fact, I think it's harder for those inside, yes, who haven't got freedom. You've got to carry that with them every day.

Yeah, and would love to contact their mums, they are, but they can't.

### [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaIkp9S6Vw&t=6074s)

Yeah. Yeah. The theory that we're the ones that have turned our backs, put our barriers up. We're not. No. No barriers from our side. No. Doors wide open.

No judgment. Yeah.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
