## Summary

From a young age, Helen knew she wanted to leave the PBCC or Exclusive Brethren as it was known when she was a child. She also knew doing so would rip apart the tight-knit and loving family she was born into.
In part one, Helen talks us through how she navigated this dilemma both emotionally and practically culminating in her leaving at the age of 16, including the pressure she was put under through weekly priestly visits. She takes us on a journey of what it was like collecting signatures from the important members inside the sect, including a prominent drawing from James Symington. There's also a shocking story that continues to be the dilemma in this patriarchal cult.
Join Jacky, Ross, and Andrea as they unpack another survivor story that ends with many, many blessings.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast. I was at a break once. There was this poor sister who had terminal cancer, was in huge amounts of pain, not at the break, but there was, I think it was her husband or family member who was talking about her that, because I was saying, how is she? She said, oh, she's in huge amounts of pain. She's really struggling, you know, but then being in pain and this other brother in man turn around and say hey wow these sisters [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=30s) don't know what suffering is. And I just thought I wish I'd had the courage to say how dare you. How dare you make that comment these these sisters don't know what suffering is. I just thought wow that's just something else.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=47s)

Yeah, I mean they they make that comment but I mean the biggest burden is put on the sisters isn't it really with all the entertaining and looking after the kids and.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=57s)

Yeah, yeah my blood is boiling right now at that moment I just.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=64s)

Don't know what to say.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=65s)

To that, yeah that makes my blood boil.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=68s)

And then and then the and then the other comment I've heard others say as well, so I've heard this before that it's better off that you know if somebody's going to leave the brethren, well actually it's better if they die because they are.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=79s)

Welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=102s)

Hello everyone, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast. I'm Jacky Hart and I'm an ex-member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which was formerly known as the Exclusive Brethren. I have my friends with me they can introduce themselves.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=115s)

Hi, I'm Andrea Becker. I'm from Germany, originally Canada and I left the brethren a year ago with my husband and two daughters.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=124s)

Hi, I'm Ross Turner. I'm from Peterborough, I was kicked out of the Exclusive Brethren in 2014 for being gay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=132s)

Thank you. And we also have our special guest with us Helen. Helen is currently in Australia but she was originally from the UK and Helen's here to tell her story which I know a little bit about and it's quite an amazing one. So Helen, I'm going to hand over to you and let's start at the beginning.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=151s)

Okay, all right thank you so much for inviting me on here. I'm happy, I'm very happy to tell my story. So I was born in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church or as I used to know it, the Exclusive Brethren. My parents were born into it as multi-generational, their parents born into it too except for my grandmother who on my mother's side, my maternal grandmother who came in from outside and she from what I remember now, she was invited to attend one of the meetings by a friend of [hers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=181s) and decided to stay and never leave. So yeah, we've had I was had a very happy childhood growing up in Watford.

I was one of four children for quite a long period of time before my younger brother came along. But it was a very happy childhood, very loving family. My dad was a very hands-on dad. My mum and dad had a very equal partnership and a very respectful for one, two. They made joint decisions on everything.

And he always used to help around. I remember him being very hands-on, making us breakfast every morning.

And also they took us on a lot of day trips. Obviously we were never allowed to stay away over the night or go on holidays, but they used to take advantage as much as they could or take us to various places all over the country. And there's not many places in the UK that I haven't visited because of the amount of day trips that we used to go on as kids.

So I was very close to all my grandparents and my uncles and aunts and cousins. There weren't any members of my family that had ever left before. So it was a very tight knit and close family. I had some really good friends in the brethren that I grew up with. I also grew up in the era of JHS, Mr. Symington, and he was hardline, he was pedantic, he was dictatorial. He ruled with a lot of fear, had a huge amount of control. I remember. And he [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=276s) you know, everybody was very fearful of him.

At the age of about 10, I was actually given a camera for my 10th birthday and I would take a lot of photos of friends. I mean, you can imagine that preteen and teenage girl, you took a lot of pictures of my friends, family. And I still have those albums even today and I'm so glad I did because I'll just show you them actually I've got a load of albums here, so photo albums and these were all pictures that I had growing up and [I'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=312s) refer back to some of those because it's been a really incredible opportunity to create some memories and and be able to look back and think yes I really did have life and a great family at that stage of my life.

When I was seven years old something really pivotal happened to me and it had huge reverberations throughout the rest of my life and continues to be something that I look back on. My dad was always on the periphery of being I guess a responsible brother, a leading brother. He would occasionally be sitting in the front row of the meetings. He was a very modest man though and quite humble and I don't think he really liked too much attention drawn to him.

And he was involved in some priestly visits himself as well because of his seniority within the brethren.

There was one day when I was seven years old and my mum came into the bedroom that I shared with my two sisters and she was very tearful. She told us that we had been shut up and I remember just thinking, I mean it's almost our world falling apart. You know, there was something you always would absolutely dread and be so fearful of. That was one thing you were fearful of, being kicked out the brethren. You did everything to keep yourself in and so I remember asking why and I wasn't given an answer. I vaguely sort of recall that it might have been something my dad had asked or questioned that he something he questioned but again I'm not 100% sure on that fact but I tried to imagine, I remember trying to imagine what our life was going to be like and I know we were shut up, would we ever be able to go back.

I don't remember too much about the few days that followed but then about a week later my mum came back into our bedroom in floods of tears and said that he's been withdrawn from. Well, this was just a whole new level of fear and just thinking, I think like a lot of kids that age would probably feel you know we're going to go to hell, we're now going to miss out on the rapture. And you know just a side note to the brethren there, that the amount of fear that the brethren put into children at that age [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=449s) the fear of the rapture and the fear of being left behind. It's extremely cruel, extremely damaging and detrimental to mental health, and think of the children. Because I'm not the only one that, you know, ever felt like that. 

But there were a bit of a blur those next few days when we've been told my dad had been withdrawn from. And on the day that, like I said, going back to that day that my mum came into our bedroom and says you know he's been withdrawn from and in the tears and my my brother, my older [brother,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=483s) my two sisters were so distraught as I was but I remember going to my bedroom window looking out and seeing this boy walking down the road and he was holding a little radio on his shoulder and he was just walking down the road. I remember thinking how can you do that, how can you walk down the road looking so free, looking so happy, not looking over your shoulder and wondering if anybody's going to catch you and then report you so that you'll be torn away from your family. 

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=514s) and this overwhelming feeling came over me, it's almost like a blanket being put around my shoulders and they said you know one day you're going to be as free as he is and you're going to be free, you're going to be like this, this is this is not how you're going to believe. And it was it was such a feeling of complete warmth and overwhelming happiness that I felt in that moment of absolutely distraught when I looked around the rest of the room and everybody was so [distraught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=544s) I just remember thinking everything's gonna, everything's gonna be okay, I'm gonna be all right, I'm gonna be good. and also it made me then relax because I thought no matter what now happens, this is not going to be in my life. I will not live in the way that my parents do with this fear, this cloud hanging over them.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=565s)

And so when you were seven, I was gonna say you were pretty young, that's pretty young to have that understanding because like the kind of fear is actually it's hard to comprehend isn't it? And you learn it from watching people around you like your parents, you learn that fear from them completely.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=581s)

Completely. I guess in some respects it was almost like a reverse form of brainwashing. I was brainwashing myself to say this is not how you're going to be and this is you're going to be out of here at some stage. Now I had no idea how that was going to look or what was going to happen but I grew up from the age of seven with this in the back of my mind thinking that this is what I'm going to do, I'm going to actually, I'm actually going to go. And so yeah I felt completely at peace with that decision that no matter [what,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=612s) and what how my journey was going to be over the next several years it was eventually it was going to be out the door and freedom. and there were a few things that helped me in that journey because I had really good school friends. I didn't go to a brethren school that was pre only a few pre-brethren school days yeah. We had that small touch of freedom, didn't we? 

We absolutely did. Yeah I think that I mean thank goodness, thank goodness I did have that because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=642s) became, I had a really good friend and I'll call her Pam, she does I haven't given her she hasn't asked her permission around using her name for the but I'll call her Pam. She was amazing she she was really interested in my life and I had some really good friends around me so my very very best friend in the whole world, my younger sister we were very close friends, the other person was my school friend and then I had two two brethren friends as well, girls that were really good friends of mine so I had these different [pockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=672s) of friends when I was at school, I was at home and I was when I was in the brethren but at school Pam was just incredible and I was fascinated by her life and she would share things around that was happening to me and likewise. 

And about a year later after the summer holidays she came back to school and said Helen I've become a born again Christian. Well I had no idea really what that meant, yeah but all of a sudden she started wanting to talk about her faith with me, talk about [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=702s) Bible, talk about the church, about the services that she went to. It was a very sort of evangelical type of church and it was just blew my mind that there was these churches even existed, it was just very odd and that's quite a point.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=717s)

I remember in the days when you and I were in Helen, it was very hard to comprehend that there was any other church outside of the brethren church that believed in Jesus. And as you say, to actually be told there's somebody who's talking about faith in a way, it's quite mind-blowing, isn't it? Yes, it absolutely is. You're led to believe that there's no other church that has a faith like the brethren have. Definitely.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=744s)

Not to mention that they talk about Jesus way more than the brethren did. Well yes and the bible and they actually understand what a conversion is we were not taught that, we were taught fear, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=756s)

Yes, yes, exactly. And she would ask me what I thought about certain scriptures, I had no idea. She would bring her, she'd bring a New International Version of the bible into school and she'd show me. I thought well I'm not sure if I should touch it but let me have a look. Such was the fear though, wasn't it? I know. Yeah and I remember reading it and thinking I actually understand this.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=784s)

I understand this. So to explain to the non-brethren viewers the brethren Bible is written in quite an old text style isn't it? It's very thee and thou and it makes quite a difficult read whereas the New International Version as we know is is written in a much more colloquial language or easy to understand language but you're right it's.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=808s)

Yeah, that's absolutely true. And so that was really interesting and she was so that was really good and I was started and I I did well at school. Fortunately I did pretty well, I found school work really easily, I did well in my exams. And at about the age of 14 I then started and really think okay I'm going to be leaving. It was just an absolute still and at that age seven years on it was an absolute I will be leaving. How is this going to look? And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=839s) I thought well maybe I'll go to university, I'll have to wait till I'm 18 because anything around that at that era you can do anything until you're 18\. 

You need your parents' permission for almost everything you did so I thought well at 18 I will I will apply for university and I'll go to university and I'll do that. Or the other thing I was thinking maybe I need to earn money so I thought maybe I'll join the army and I would wait till I was 18\. I'm going to apply to join the army and on the day that I was due to [join](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=871s) I would walk out the house, I'd leave a note and I'll go to do my training and they wouldn't be able to get get, they wouldn't be able to get at me and I would leave like that. So I had these sort of vague sort of plans in my head around maybe that that might be but I think it all centered around me being 18 and I started to sort of wish my life away to the age of 18 really.

And it got to the stage at school where I was starting to ask, I want to stand to sixth form, want to do my A-levels and of course my parents said well there's no point. What else do you want to do that? You can only go, you know, that's for people who want to go to university, you know you're not going to university. I'm thinking well actually that's exactly what I'm planning to do.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=911s)

So just to interject sorry so obviously your father was withdrawn from so I presume...

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=918s)

No, sorry I should have gone back, yeah. So he so at seven years old when he was withdrawn from, actually he was, he and I, we were all back in within a few days. He was yeah shut up. So I should have gone back.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=936s)

Are they still in?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=936s)

Yes, yes absolutely yeah, yeah. so they were uh, we were, the whole episode of around when I was seven years to my dad being shut up and withdrawn from and then back to shut up and then it was a space of three weeks it was really quick. Yeah, sorry I should have said that so no no that's okay yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're all back together again.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=955s)

But I also, I remember that episode because obviously you and I were in the same interchange and I do remember that and it was also quite peculiar because nobody knew why. We we didn't know what had happened to your father, suddenly the family and there was sort of you know they've been shut up, he's been withdrawn but nobody knew why. We didn't know what was going on and then he was back. Yeah, your father I remember he was a very gentle man, I mean it must have destroyed him emotionally.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=984s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah it did and my mum as well I think you know they just couldn't understand what it was and I remember thinking you know my dad you know wouldn't walk out you know on the crack of a pavement, you know, he was so obedient and it was just the most strangest thing. And of course he was just incredibly grateful to be back. there was no anger, no, you know, he was just you know looking internally as to what on earth he could have done. I think, I think the only thing I can think of is that he was [quest-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1014s) you know he questioned something, everybody was being withdrawn from and shut up with impunity around that. Yeah personalities, yeah, yeah. Was he ever told why? I don't know, I don't know, he it's not something he ever wanted to talk about with with me.

 like I said the only thing and the vague reference to him being quite, him questioning something. how dare he, yeah, yeah, he did he do that, yeah. yeah [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1045s) was, it was just a bit of a strange thing. About the age of 16 now and I my friend Pam, she's now, now, we're both really into music. So I was playing the piano a lot at that time, I was having lessons and I loved, loved music, anything to do with music. And my school friend Pam was recording the top 40 on a Saturday on a chance and they came on. So on the Saturday, if you're in the UK, Radio 1 would play the top 40 hits. So she would record them on a tape. On a Monday, she'd bring the tape to me to school and give it to me and I managed to buy myself some headphones and a little Walkman to put the tape in and listen to it. 

And I would sometimes go into music blocks, there was some brethren children that went to the same school and obviously my my sisters went to the same school so I'd have to be really careful. I'll go into the music block and put my headphones [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1101s) listen or there's a wood next door so sometimes after school I'd take a long way through the woods to get home sometimes like and then at night time if I was, if my sister was absolutely dead asleep I would go under the blankets and put my headphones under the blankets in my bed. I was always really careful about three secret places to hide these and I there was uh one day I came home of course you know eventually they're always going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1131s) be found and then my mum had found them. She said look what I found, this is terrible you know, we found these tapes and cassette, how dare you have this, you know you know you're not allowed to have this. I said yeah, no, but can I have them back they are mine. 

Of course that was not going to happen. So I after dinner I went up to my room. I remember, I remember the day went up to and I'm laying on the bed and thinking you know goodness I'm gonna [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1161s) get ready for the meeting which I didn't want to go to. And all of a sudden I hear this crash crash crash. I look outside my bedroom window and there's my dad and my brother with a hammer and my Walkman and my cassette tapes smashing them to pieces on the patio. And I remember just thinking you know yeah, I thought that was gonna happen, I'm just just see that happening. okay well I'm gonna have to get another one now.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1191s)

Did he tell my dad how to do it? Because my dad made me step on mine until it was crushed.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1199s)

Really? Yeah yeah it must be the thing. Oh wow, so you would have known what that was like, yeah.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1205s)

Yeah, and you...

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1206s)

Look and you just imagine the money going out the window.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1210s)

What a waste.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1211s)

Yeah, I was like you Helen, as soon as I got rid of one I bought another one.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1217s)

Yeah, yeah, it was it was quite fun, yeah. There was actually going back there's actually a really funny thing that happened and with a meeting that I went to with uh James Simonton so he'd come to do a preaching at Barnet. Mr. Simonton was doing a reading or preaching, I can't remember which one it was now, and he'd finished and we were all at that stage a lot of kids my age were [collecting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1247s) autographs. Do you remember that? Yes, it was a thing, wasn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1253s)

I found mine the other day.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1256s)

Are you found yours? I had one of those, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1259s)

Yeah, and afterwards you go around, especially if there was a resident that come from other places, you go around and get your autograph. Well, I think James Simonton knew that, you know, these kids were doing this. So after the meeting he said if it, you know, he made the thing that if anybody wants a sign you know signature you all the kids can queue up and he'll sign his signature. So I thought oh this is good yeah I'll do this so I was collecting them, you know, like stamps at that time. So uh I didn't have my autograph book, I borrowed my notebook from some kid and uh page ripped a [page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1289s) out and off I go to queue up and he comes to mind, I give him my piece of paper to sign except he doesn't sign it he draws me a little pig.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1297s)

No. Have you still got that picture?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1304s)

I still, I still got it, I still got it. And I'm thinking oh that's not what I wanted I wanted his signature. So I'm a bit, I'm a bit you know annoyed about this and I decide that there's only one thing for it, I'm gonna have to go and queue up again and get your signature. So that's what I do I go around and I queue up again to get his signature and when I go I'm thinking you better not draw me a pig, I want his signature and sure enough I get his signature, yeah. Anyway I'm coming out and all these brethren have heard that he's drawn me a pig and I'm walking back and they say let me see you, let me [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1339s) that thing that you drew let me have a look. Oh how wonderful how special. So I'm thinking there's a pig I wasn't gonna do anything with it but my mom stuck it in this little autocgraph and it's in here with with with the signature. Oh, so it was in here and it's there, it's I don't know if you can see there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1360s)

Oh yes yes, we can.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1364s)

Yeah, yeah it's a bit of drawing there's like a felt pen drawing behind it so it's it but anyways the uh the scan picture I've done is much better.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1374s)

Yeah. What that kind of shows though is how much the leaders were almost revered and it's the same now isn't it but I mean I remember in JHS's day you know everything he did and said was revered. So even a drawing of a pig it seemed like a a sacred almost after...

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1398s)

Like what does it mean? Like what does the pig mean for her?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1405s)

Yeah, yeah, and afterwards for weeks afterwards whenever we there was a break or there was a meal you know you you had people around you know for Sunday dinner and you know the pig would come up in conversation and I'd been told to bring the pig out so people could have a look. And you must have a look at the pigs that she's been doing. And [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1435s) I left home, I mean I'm full for when I left home I actually said to my parents I'm going to leave my autograph book here, you you it would mean much more to you. And those you can't possibly, how could you say that? You take that with you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1449s)

That would give you, that would encourage you in years to come, it will give you a measure of protection.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1454s)

Yeah, the pig will give you protection. Yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1464s)

It's just so amazing. Anyway that's a bit of a side story. Yeah, it's a nice story but anyway, I wish I'll share the pig. so then uh I started seeing yeah I had a lot more contact with with with Pam after school. So after school, I'd run home to her house. If I ran, give me more time to be at her house. And she would put on things like Torvill and Dean, you know, the Olympic, their Olympic ice dance, the Bolero, they won gold medal in the [Sarajevo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1494s) Olympics. I think it was early 80s. And she'd recorded. And there were other sort of events, big events around that time that she recorded on video. And I'd go and watch these. And I was just amazed, you know, the whole technology and TV and I became such a bit of a such a TV addict in those days and desperate to go around, put the TV on what's on she said it was just ads, doesn't matter we'll watch the ads.

And she was but she was she was incredible. She was such a patient and so supportive as well of everything I'm doing but the meetings at that stage were feeling like an absolute dirge and I was wanting to, you know, I wanted to stay on. I was having a conflict with my parents. I wanted to stay on at sixth form. And eventually, after going to college and meeting with the tutors there, because my parents said, if you want to stay on at sixth form, at least go and speak to the college. Find out what [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1549s) offering. And I came and I said, okay, I've met them. Don't want them. Now we've signed off and let me go to school. Stay on at school. And that is, you said, okay, all right, okay. I don't know what you're going to do with your A-levels, but there you go. You can do them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1562s)

So that's incredible. If I could backtrack a little bit what the thinking was at that time, at that time when you and I were at school, Helen, it was very much you left school at 16 and you went and learned a trade, didn't you? So for girls, it would be typing and shorthand. I think that was that was about the sum total. Absolutely. For the boys it would be carpentry or brick lane so it was very much you went and you went to college and learned a trade or you went to work at 16 because of course then it wasn't compulsory you could leave education at 16 then you couldn't [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1592s) but to go and do A-levels was if you like really perceived as not allowed back then wasn't it? It was perceived as using your natural brain and it's not a way you want to go and learn a trade. I mean that'd be fair to say wouldn't it when we were.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1607s)

Absolutely right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1608s)

Yeah, so you were bucking the system by wanting to do A-levels.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1612s)

I was definitely bucking the system and I think what helped was although you know our parents loved us equally, there was absolutely no doubt that we all felt loved in equal measure, my mum loved the fact that I was what she was termed quite quick and able to you know do so well at school and she really, actually my parents really encouraged it which maybe it was a bit unusual but out of the four, out of the five of us kids you know to have that support from my parents especially in that [era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1642s) was quite unusual.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1643s)

I mean one thing I wonder, your mum joined from, did she join from outside her parents, your grandmother did. Yeah, yeah, I sometimes wonder because my mother joined from outside whether that just gives that slight element of independent thinking because I had a similar encouragement from my mother who joined. And it's just that slight maybe element of independent thinking that wants to see you do well despite everything.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1671s)

Yeah, and I think it was the same with us. I didn't do my A-levels, but my mum went to university. She was one of the last ones that did. And, yeah, I think it does definitely make a difference. Yeah, it really does.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1686s)

And it's good that they they they chose to not follow everyone else, right, and to allow you to go no matter what everybody else thought.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1693s)

Yeah and I think a lot of the time my parents used to really push things as far as they felt they could allow. I was really into horses I love, I would I wanted to learn to ride horses, I wanted to have horse riding lessons so badly. I bought some horses, I was just horse crazy. And I remember my mum saying you know she said if you could if we could if we were allowed I would allow you to have horse riding lessons and to me that was almost as good as having horse [riding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1723s) lessons to have that acknowledgement. so I'll never forget that. We shouldn't say that a lot of things but I do remember that she knew I'm so into horses and horse riding that that was something that to have her say that was good.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1736s)

That's too bad you missed out because now nowadays I know lots of children and the brethren who have horse riding lessons. Yeah, really, some of my nieces do, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1748s)

Exactly, yeah. You know, the little stare era wasn't it that one Lord turned a corner about horse riding, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1758s)

Yeah, it must be.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1760s)

Early enough, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1761s)

The lord must be dizzy with all the corners things turn.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1765s)

Yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah. so but at that stage as soon as I said you can stay on, well I became incredibly impatient and around wanting to leave and I wanted a life of freedom. I saw my best friend Pam have this amazing life outside and I wanted her life you know I wanted to be be able to meet up with friends, go to a different church, go to the cinema, go do the school trips that I was never allowed to do and [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1796s) know have fun on the weekends.

 I mean I couldn't ever say that we know apart from spend time with family which I really enjoyed but the meetings weren't fun. I mean the whole Sunday, it was never fun, it was not a Sunday fun day. I still wasn't sure what I wanted to quite do you know but I realized I needed to have a plan B, I could not wait till I was 18\. I needed a plan B, I needed to get out there earlier [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1826s) talked to it's over with Pam and she said that's fine and her and her mum both said to me you can come and live with us, come and stay with us, stay with us until you work at what you need to do regarding moving on to the next stage but then you can always come and live with us. And I think having that in the back of my mind thinking okay well maybe I can actually think about going. This was about a month before and this is a picture of my sister and I and we are sitting next to my brother's new car and [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1856s) was, yeah I just wanted to show that because that's probably the closest picture I've got to just before everything the proverbial hit the fan and and I ended up leaving but I love my sister and I, that's one of the pictures I really, it's very very special to me so I'm just going to stop sharing that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1878s)

That's how I remember you Helen, I remember that yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1882s)

Yeah I just want to, I want to go back to your friend Pam at school like it really is so apparent to me that that's why they stopped letting the older children go to go to the regular schools because you got that bond from a young age and she was a true friend who showed you that people in the real world are just as kind and loving and as you say a born-again Christian, somebody honorable and you know kind and it really you know as a child who was raised in the era of brethren schools [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1912s) mean I went to public school until grade six which is now rare, children only go to grade two in public school but it really does create you those bonds and you know it kind of helped you on your on your pathway out, right?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1926s)

Yeah, that's right.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1927s)

And it's so so apparent to me why they had to stop that because they were just leading people out from letting them have contact.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1936s)

Yeah, with the real world completely. Completely agree with you there. I think without me going to a public high school with a non-brethren school I would not have got all this information and maybe my life would have been different, I don't know. I mean I was so adamant and it was such a an in-depth feeling that I was going to leave I don't know if anything would have stopped that but it definitely made things easier.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1961s)

Yeah, and it helped you, helped you understand that the real world is not something to be terrified of, right?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1966s)

Yeah, exactly, exactly. I'll see if I can share it again because I just want to show you something that I've got here and I don't know where this is going. so this is a letter and I found this a few years ago I found this letter so this so I used to do draft letters a lot and this was before for computers obviously so I drafted this letter to them and it was really just saying you know if you're not listening then [maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=1996s) I'll need to write. 

The worst harm you could do to yourselves and to me is forced me to give up the tapes, these are the music tapes I've been given. By doing so I'll probably buy some more not to spite you but because I've no conviction as to what I've done is wrong. At 16 I think I should be able to make my own decisions and then I go on saying that you know I've done, you know, please understand I'm different from my brothers and sisters and then I talk about the you know how I don't want to cause mean you any heartbreak and or anger or upset you, and I don't do any of this on purpose, but it's just, you know, you're forcing me to do things that I don't feel are wrong or that feel are right for me and everything I'm doing, I don't believe I'm doing anything wrong and that I do want to see somebody about this. 

And the second page says, I do want to see somebody about this and tell them, and I'm not afraid of confessing everything to them, saying that, you know, my sister's deeply, you know, shocked and now she's not talking to me and it hurts me but you know and I just finish up by saying that you know please don't think I do not love you because I love you both. So that was a letter and then I wrote that out and uh yeah I did so I wrote that out again that was just a draft with mistakes of things. So then what I would do is I'll write that out in freehand to make sure I don't [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2084s) any mistakes and I gave that to them. I got no response at all to that which at all and but it wasn't too much longer after that that I'll come back out of that again.

 It wasn't too much longer after that that I was thinking what can I do to get myself because it was there was no point in me saying oh I'm going to leave, I'm going to walk out the door because I I wasn't early, I was 16 I you know they could have brought me back at any time. So I was almost having to [force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2115s) the issue and do something to get myself kicked out. And then an opportunity presented itself on a plate to me and I was studying English English literature at school as part of my GCSE exam and they were organizing a play a trip to Stratford-on-Avon to see a Shakespeare play, Merchant of Venice, which I thought perfect I'm gonna go. I probably will get caught and then that would get me [kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2145s) out. I just paid money, I said I'd lost the form sorry my parents didn't sign the form, I've lost it but here's the money. 

They unfortunately they just added me to the list and off I went for the day. I told my mum I was going to be late I was got a music exam and I came home really late and I was very bad, I ran all the way home because I knew my my mum would be so worried and of course she was, she was really worried and also she said I phoned school you were not at school you there was no music exam. I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2175s) know where you were. And I said I'm so sorry. So where have you been? I took a deep breath okay here it goes, I said I've been to the theater with the school. Wow and she just you know absolutely shocked and well that's absolutely terrible and she told my dad and he said you know he said we've tried to hold back, we've tried not to you know involve the priest. He said but this is a step too far, we're going to now have to tell the priest and I remember thinking oh thank goodness for that, [finally.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2205s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2205s)

At last, yeah, here goes.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2214s)

It was, it was it really was and I went I remember going shortly in but there was a bit of a funny period between that happening to actually the priest come to visit me and in the middle in between that they sent me off to Bristol, you know, I think they thought that I'll get some divine inspiration and you know I'd you know see the better of my ways.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2235s)

And so was that one of the Bristol, did you go and stay there or was it one of the monthly meetings sorry?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2241s)

The monthly meetings yes, every month there was there was a big monthly meeting yeah in Bristol where all of the brethren from all over the country and probably maybe Europe as well I think yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2251s)

Yeah, I used to go to those and it was perceived to get a Bristol invite was perceived as an honor, wasn't it? It was yeah it was.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2259s)

Oh it's a huge thing wasn't it, yeah, down there.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2263s)

After after you'd been you were like eagerly awaiting your next invite, weren't you?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2268s)

Yes, yeah because you managed to see a lot of people that you might have seen at other three-day meetings and yes some friends and people. I mean that was good. I was virtually being shunned at that time by it and maybe because I was withdrawing myself and my friends, my my brethren friends and my sister and my family. What year would this have been sort of uh? So this would be 1984 I want to say 1984, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I came I remember [coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2299s) back and just no, at the following day going to another meeting and my mum said you're sitting with me because at 16 you'd often go and see, yeah yeah sit next to one of the brethren brains and yeah you would not be sitting with your mother. Yeah that means you're in trouble.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2318s)

It does, basically. Yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2318s)

Yeah, yeah, I remember a whole Saturday Sunday, the whole following Sunday every single meeting mom said you're sitting next to me. And I'm saying, and I did my at that time I thought I don't care. nobody's talking to me anyway, I haven't got any friends to go and sit next to, so all good, I'm fine with that. And it was on the following Saturday that oh that my dad said you're gonna have priests come around to visit you today. So they came around there were two brethren priests [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2349s) my locality who I've grown up with and so that felt strange. It was in my parents' living room on my own with two male priests, two male priests. Sixteen, yeah, two to three. I grew up with them so they were close in age to you? No they were close the same age as my dad. Oh, okay sorry. One of them yeah so one of them had children like my age and I like I've known them all my life so they've [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2379s) felt really strange and I think even they felt a bit, you know, I don't know what to say to you. and also they...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2386s)

Yeah, very uncomfortable situation isn't it? You're you're sitting there, I had one at a similar age with similar people, two male priests that had grown up at the same age as my parents and it's an incredibly uncomfortable situation. You're 16, you're mid-teens, you're sitting in your lounge with two men who are quizzing you about your sins. Now I'm not talking about anything of a sexual nature here, for me they were quizzing why I turned on a radio that that that was the line of their question. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2417s) imagine yours was similar you know why did you go to the theater why yeah it did is it yeah and do you realize the gravity of what you've done?

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2424s)

And you're thinking absolutely it was yeah. They'd probably done the similar thing two weeks ago yeah probably, yes.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2431s)

Yeah, yeah so it's a case of you know are you sorry for what you've done? no, yes, no, no, no, no, sorry. would you do it again? Yes, I would.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2444s)

And to put it in context we're talking about going to the theater. Yeah, to put it into context.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2453s)

Yeah, I'll go again. was you know is there anything else you want to talk about, anything else you want to confess? No. And so maybe they bring something up you know that was my dad might have said and somebody else might have reported and that's and I just sit there and I just say no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment. So that was and that went on for the for the first two so it's the second Saturday it was almost repeat of the first. they've then [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2483s) to try and make me feel bad by saying oh you know what you're doing is affecting you know Mr. Symington and you just think how terrible your actions are, how bad he would feel, how terrible it is for him to know that there's that you were saying all of this. And then I'm thinking I don't care and then I really didn't care you know to be honest but then they turn it on to my parents. 

They say you do you realize how much suffering you're causing your parents and that will, that hurt. That hurt, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2514s) really did hurt yeah, that will hurt me. And you know and I did acknowledge and I said yeah I do know and that was the only time I think I really sort of thought yeah and I did say to them well yes I do and I don't feel good about that. The third time, third week came, just consecutive weeks on the third week and I remember thinking to myself I cannot keep doing this. but if this is what I can, I need to just relax and just have a bit of you know and just lighten this up a bit because it's just [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2544s) my head in. And also was taking my GCSEs at the time as well so there was all that stress going on as well. 

The third time it was it was very different and I sort of you know talked about my week, talked about my family, talked about things that you know good things that have happened to me and it was just a much more of a light-hearted sort of meeting. And what would happen is after I got done had these priest visit, my dad, I would go [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2574s) and then my dad would come in, they would debrief with him and he would maybe make some comments or not not depending on whether or not he wanted to talk this over with me. On the third time they came and see me and he had his debrief, he came up to me and said ah I said that was so good, he said they were really encouraged by what you said, you did really well, you keep you know you have more conversations like that. He said we'll get through this. He said he's really good Helen, really good. I was thinking oh I've just put set myself back.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2604s)

And if I can just interject there for a moment, I know Cheryl Bawtinheimer said this on podcast before but to people inside that listen, when it comes to these priestly visits you do not have to be on your own. It is in your perfect right to say you want a friend with you and if you're 16 you can have your parents with you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2626s)

If you are on your own you have a right to ask to record it because it is intimidating and you are perfectly within your rights to say I do not want to see two men on my own. And I just want to interject that there for anyone that is perhaps enduring this at the moment. you have a right to say that, don't you? Obviously it's at the time we didn't realize our rights but now, yeah, yeah, you can refuse, you do not have to have, yeah.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2654s)

And also you don't actually have to have the visits at all. No, you can refuse. That is bullying right to say I don't want to. We've never had a priestly visit since we've left because we've said we don't want it. And I mean, a teenager in a vulnerable position, which he knows it's not confidential, as you did, your father got a debrief. So you know what you said your father would know. That's not confidential. That doesn't make somebody feel loved and ready to confess.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2681s)

No, there's no obligation at all, no matter how they make you feel. You can point blank refuse to see them if you emotionally can't cope with it. But I digress but I just think that's quite an important point to make to anyone inside.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2693s)

Absolutely, very important, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2695s)

Or use the “no comment” like Helen. Or I know of somebody else that literally didn't answer they had the strength of character to literally say nothing so the pre...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2705s)

Visits were just nothing. I mean in one of my priestly visits I literally walked out the room and I said look I'm not listening to this anymore yeah I walked out.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2715s)

That would have been the best one. Yeah yeah yeah that's how it told them, well done, yeah that's great and I think refusal and just no comment is a perfect thing to do yeah. but the fourth the fourth week came through and I remember thinking okay I've I've just got to be this home now this is just it's gone on for now three weeks and I cannot give them any fault, I didn't want to give them false hope at all and that's what I felt I'd done, that's what I've been made to believe I'd done on the previous week. 

So I was really direct this time and I was like [no,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2745s) I am not sorry, I will never repent, I will know you'll never get an apology out of me. I have done nothing wrong and you know I had a great time and given the opportunity I would go back never again tomorrow. It was so good I had such a great time at the theatre, I mean it wasn't that great but you know I wasn't going to tell them that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2766s)

Must take an incredible strength of character.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2768s)

It really did because they make you so feels...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2771s)

Yeah, they make you feel you've done wrong, you went to the theater but you feel you've done something absolutely terrible. And to turn around and say what I did was not terrible and I enjoyed it and I'll do it again took incredible strength for character at 16\.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2786s)

Yeah, yeah, but I just felt it was you know it, I had to, it was something I had to go through yeah to get my freedom. And freedom, I was in the pursuit of freedom, I've been in the pursuit of freedom for nine years and I was just about going to get it. I was so close and so I had to just influence us from my point of view. I I I had no other option, I had no other plan to leave, I didn't know how else I was going to [leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2816s) unless I stayed in for another two years and I just couldn't do it. I I mentally I I was just at the end. 

So obviously that didn't go down too well and the following day my mum again would sit next to me at all the meetings on the on the Sunday. And Tuesday I didn't go off so she's got my exams, I was having exams and I was so stressed with everything that was going on [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2847s) the mother came in on on Tuesday night and said just to let you know you've been shut up. And it was just like wow this is, I've done it, I've done it, I've actually done it. Hallelujah. I was like oh my goodness what next, what next. Everything had been leading up to the point of getting kicked out.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2874s)

But and that feeling of relief because I like you I can remember it was a a care meeting. my dad came home from the care meeting, I hadn't gone and he came home he said oh you've been withdrawn from and I was like yes, you know, I've finally done it. Yeah, it's just amazing.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2894s)

But also the impact then that I felt was going to have on the rest of the family because in within 24 hours my brother's, my brother and my two sisters left they're gone. I went to school I came back they're gone. And all of a sudden my bedroom that I shared with my best friend of my youngest sister...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2914s)

So if I could just explain the rationale behind that if for anybody that's non-brethren, if somebody within the family is shut up or restricted, presumably your parents were too, then all the other siblings would not be allowed to live in the same house as this unclean shut up person. So they would have gone to stay with other brethren families overnight wouldn't they? No question. No question, they just move out yeah and that's what happened.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2940s)

Yep, my younger brother stayed, he was only six at the time so he stayed at home and I was really glad of that I think my parents were too. But what happened next was oh god so for then there were some walls that were placed in so I was not allowed to go downstairs, I had to live in my bedroom. So my meals were brought in the tray outside of my room and they put a little table in there and the tray of food would come up to my bedroom door, knock on the door which would seem good to me [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=2970s) food was outside. So I'd go in get my food tray on the table. I spent as little time at home as I could, I spent a lot of time with my friend Pam and my other school friends and other friends from her church.

 I started going to her friend's church which my dad had a big issue with going to a different church. I mean that's probably one of the most simple things I could have ever done. I also got a good a Good News Bible so I had a bible that I was readable. and again that was something that those two things I think he found, yeah my [parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3000s) I think found quite abhorrent. and it's, I was in two weeks I got my ears pierced, I got a Saturday job, I started saving up. I wanted to get my is my haircut or my hair cut off and I remember going to a salon and sitting down with a hairdresser saying well get all my hair cut. So it was just a planning day to get a planning day about my hair and what it would look like. So she said you know you just want a trim. I said no no all off, all.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3030s)

I want it short, yeah sure.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3033s)

But you were like a bird set free. You were just like yeah yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3039s)

And highlights, lowlights and color in my hair and I thought yeah this is. So I went back for my appointment oh so even when my ears pissed I have my long hair I was covering it up, I was pulling my hair just when I went home because I just didn't want, nothing I was ashamed of it but I just didn't want the drama of my parents finding out and then all that you know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3061s)

And think we know it would upset your parents as well, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3065s)

Yeah and it was definitely and none of us want to upset our parents, we we know we do because of the rules but.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3072s)

We don't actually set out to do that, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3074s)

Yeah but I think maybe my 16 year old brain was like you know do the thing, do the thing and then think about it afterwards, get get my ears pierced. It was like oh what do I do now oh how oh what are they going to do when they find out. It's a bit of my hair so finally I went in to get my hair cut and the hairdresser like cut a bit off, she said is that are you sure you want to go. No get it all off all off.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3096s)

And also these things when we do these things it's kind of like saying to ourself I'm not turning back, right? Yes, yes. I got my ears pierced a week after we left and it was like no because this is a visible change and I cannot taking it back, right? Yeah, that's what you were doing, you were you were putting your stamp on yourself.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3117s)

Yeah yeah absolutely. It was it was absolutely like that, you're so true Andrea. And see I got my hair looked amazing, absolutely amazing and I'm walking home and I'm thinking oh I can't hide this, you could always wear a headscarf permanently Helen. I remember walking up the door because I didn't have a key and I would not allow me to have a key so every time I came home I had to knock on the door. I go I was thinking oh my [goodness,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3147s) I knock on the door and I put my head like this and I put my head on my forehead, for those that aren't watching this on video, put my head on my forehead trying to hide my hair.

 And I'm like opens the door and I first thing I say is just let you know I've had my hair cut. Of course she was devastated, she was really upset and I knew you know every time that happened I was you know I just felt really really bad but it was also Andrea as you say it was like a not going back. I knew [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3185s) would never ever be put into a position of humiliation of going back and being humiliated, I'm sorry I'll do it again. And everybody there standing and sitting in judgment of you over these minor infractions and incursions that they felt were you know against you know the teachings of of the great men. And it was nothing other, nothing more than fear and control that they had over you. So I just [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3215s) going to, I was, I was absolutely never ever going to go back once I once I've been shut up and then.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3222s)

Again to put it into context a bit like going to the theater, you had your hair cut and you had your ears pierced. It's something the majority of the population in this world do without even thinking about it but to us, to us in the brethren that was just such a cardinal sin. You weren't allowed to cut your hair, you weren't allowed jewelry and adornments. So the gravity of it when you're in the brethren is completely disproportionate to the majority of people's views isn't it? Yeah, we're not talking something awful sin here [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3252s) it's just having your hair cut, your ears exactly, yeah and especially at such.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3256s)

A young age, you showed, you have shown remarkable clarity like from seven until you're only 16\. Like this is some stuff you know some people realize in their 30s and 40s like yeah you had a clear uh clear view of your how you wanted your life to be and how you saw through the people manipulating you. Amazing.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3275s)

Completely. Yeah so yeah jeans as well, I wanted to buy a pair of jeans, desperate. I've always wanted to wear jeans from when I was, I don't know, five probably. And so that was one of the first things I bought with my fast day money as well as well as saving up to get my hair done was buying a pair of jeans. And what I would do because I I felt that was something I could control and sort of shield my parents. I thought they would be very upset that they wouldn't want me to wear jeans and trousers so I would put them in a bag [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3305s) I'll go out the house and I'll find a public toilet or bathroom somewhere I could change. I'd change in and spend the rest of the day in my jeans and then going home I'd find somewhere I could change back into my skirt so I could go in the house wearing a skirt. 

It brought just to just I think just a shield because there was so much I'd done that you know it was it was really upsetting to my parents. I just felt that this was something that at least I could just sort of shield them from but within about a month, six weeks I remember my mum coming saying give me [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3335s) jeans they need washing. Oh really, she knew, she knew, she found out yeah. So that was that was funny and then about a year to the day my dad came in and said just let you know you were withdrawn from, you've shown no signs of repentance and so he was withdrawn from yesterday and I was absolutely furious. I wasn't relieved, I was furious that they had made that decision without telling me beforehand. I felt like yeah they should have actually let me know beforehand that that's what they were going to do but no it was like oh by the way [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3376s) decided to do that. So they announced to everybody, everybody knew before I did.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3381s)

It's so wrong because like out here you have the right to defense but in there you don't at all.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3389s)

That's right, that's right. It's been, it was quite something. And my dad also said, I was 17 this time, and my dad also said, it's time for you to leave home. And I said, I agree. The year we'd just come to a stage where it was just absolutely intolerable. You know, I was wanting to live my life and my parents it was causing so much pain and anguish to my parents, it was definitely the right thing to do. My friend Pam and her family [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3419s) you know you can come live with us and so that's what I did. I went to live with them and the day that I left her was traumatic. I was, I was crying, my mom was crying and I said you know I wish it wasn't like this, I've never turned my back on you, I will never turn my back on you. 

And she said yeah but you know you don't want our life and we certainly don't want yours so we can't live together like this. My dad put things and everything in my all my belongings in my car in his car and drove me around to Pam, dropped me [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3449s) and helped me you know move everything in and that was it. They really sort of refused to speak to me or have anything to do with me. Sometimes I'd write them letters you know ranting over something rather and they were always very gracious but you know and their their letters became sort of more more minimal and if I phoned up just wanted to speak to my mum to hear my mom's voice she'd say you know I [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3479s) talk to you Helen, I cannot talk to you you know that. And then the the call would end. and this this is no different to how a lot of brethren you know at that sort of time were treated and I think some still treated that way and it's incredibly painful when you have done nothing wrong and you still love your family you still have huge amounts of respect for them. So it's very painful.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3503s)

There's something that again I'd again quite like to say to any insiders, the comments your parents made about you you have your life and we have ours and we don't want your life and you don't want ours what you've chosen. It's a comment we hear quite a lot both when they do press statements and personally and what I want to say to insiders that it's actually okay to have different choices in lives and still have a relationship.

 [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3533s) happens all the time it doesn't it, you know our own children choose different lives from us that we may not but that doesn't mean you cut them off. That's actually okay, okay and it's but when you're in there unless you have the brethren life it isn't okay but what I actually it is okay, it's fine for you to go and have your hair cut and have your ears pierced and want to do your A-levels and it's fine for them to have their brethren life and to believe what they believe but that doesn't should not mean a relationship should end which we all know it does but that's where it goes wrong isn't it?

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3567s)

And that goes back to that that level of fear that they hold over you your whole life. Yes, that that you eventually are raised to think that's you are are going to be in this incredibly hard position if you ever want to have your make your own choices that are different to theirs. Because we are raised that there's one, there's one path for all of us and if you should stray off of it, I don't know quite how to express it but you're going to be, you're going to be put in this impossible position.

 You either lose everyone you love to have your own life or [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3597s) suffer for the rest of your life living a life that you don't believe in. And it's, you know, like for insiders and people who have never heard about this, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, we were raised to think that's normal. Yeah. That if you want to live your own life and make your own decisions, you will inevitably be completely cut off from people that expressly still love you. And you were what, 17 when that happened? Yes.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3624s)

That's right.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3624s)

And your dad literally drove you and said, goodbye, have your own life, I'm gone. Like that is not normal.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3631s)

No, it's not, no. Especially when you've come, your family's really close and you come from a loving family, your parents love you and you love your parents and you love your family. That's what is so heartbreaking and so just destructive. That it's such a destructive feature of the brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3653s)

It also shows the level of control because I knew your family Helen and I know you were a close-knit family but still your father could do that. I don't blame your father for that yeah but the level of control from the the system that he was part of drove him to do that, drove him to drop his 17 year old daughter off and say goodbye and that's it. Yeah, and it's still staggering when you put it in black and white like that isn't [it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3683s) It's because he believed that that's what was right, yes, he believed that was the right thing to do because you were errant, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3692s)

Yes, and like in my case obviously I was still living at home when I was kicked out so my parents actually had to move out the house so we never even got to say goodbye and you know it's yeah and that's the level of control they have. It's like you say it's it's devastating, it really is, yeah, it really is.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3713s)

I completely agree with us. It's it's it's just really sad because all of us you know haven't left because we don't love our families. No, it's not us that have turned our backs on them.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3723s)

No and as a parent, I mean I don't know if you have children Helen but as a parent how could you imagine doing that to your children?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3730s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3731s)

You know, I mean that's something that we're we're doing, we're breaking these generational curses and our children, I mean we're only out a year and a bit. We've got two young daughters and I wanted to leave as soon as we could because I want them to be raised to know that no matter what they choose in their life, beyond obvious evil, which you're going to encounter anywhere, but they can do whatever they want with their life and I will still love them. I am never going to turn my back on them because I've experienced that. We've all experienced that. And it's something that is just, it's incomprehensible. Like, although you know your father loved you so deeply, he had to make that heart-wrenching decision. It's awful. It is. And the church made him think he had to do that.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3777s)

Yeah. Yeah. Shortly before I left, I became really hyper-vigilant of some of the comments that were made, especially towards women. I think even at that stage, me being a teenage girl and being so vocal, you know, being so, I was a vocalist. still quite an introvert but you know being so sure of my own pathway in all of this it was quite unusual the comments I used to hear and used to get so angry about within the brethren. 

So there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3807s) a woman who, a blind sister who had a guide dog and she was made to give up the guide dog because it was a pet. And of course brethren can't have pets so you can't have a guide dog because is a pet. So what they did was in one fell swoop they took away her independence. She then had to rely on everybody else, her husband, to walk anywhere to do anything, she had no independence they just stripped it off. They didn't care, oh it's a pet well you can't have it, can't possibly have that. It's [cruel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3837s) If that was if that was a man would it have been any different? I don't know.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3841s)

Um and that dictation probably came from James Simonton who probably had many farm dogs and farm cats running, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3848s)

Yeah on his farm, yeah. And I remember then being in a break because I've had these down some of these down as well. I was at a break once there was this poor sister whose terminal cancer was in huge amounts of pain, not at the break but there was and I think it was a husband or family member who was talking about her that because I was saying how is she, she said well she's in huge amounts of pain, she's really struggling you know with being in pain and this other brethren man turn around and say well these sisters they don't know what suffering is. And I just thought how dare you, I wish I'd had the courage to say how dare you, how dare you make that comment. These these sisters don't know what suffering is. I just thought wow that's just something else.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3899s)

Yeah, I mean they they make that comment but I mean the biggest burden is put on the sisters isn't it really with all the entertaining and looking after the kids and.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3910s)

Yeah, yeah my blood is boiling right now at that moment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3915s)

I just don't know what to say to that.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3918s)

Yeah, that makes my blood boil.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3920s)

Terrible. And then and then the and then the other comment I've heard others say as well so I've heard this before that it's better off that you know if somebody's going to leave the brethren, well actually it's better if they die because they are. I've heard you know that's been a common one. Yeah, there was also a really sad occasion where there was a uh, I won't name the one here but Jacky would would probably know this this person she was a couple, two, three years older than me and she was quite a rebel. She got caught I think [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3951s) smoking, going to the cinema and maybe even you know doing a few other minor infractions. 

Uh she was shut up and I remember thinking because I used to really admire her, I used to think you know she's you know she's she's got her life together, she's doing all these things, she'll have, she'll get herself kicked out and she'll be on her way. She did get kicked out, she got shut up and then within three or four weeks she was back and I was thinking why would you do that for? But she came back, she ended up getting married and she invited [myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=3981s) and my sister to the reception.

 I think they had a bit of a you know a few bites to eat beforehand for the wedding and back in those days you know they had these little receptions it wasn't like a proper wedding reception in the house but yeah that's right. Yeah and I still got photos actually in my books of this one and so yeah it's a lovely wedding everyone's so happy, everyone said that's so good you know she's got this marriage now because you know she repented and God's you know [provided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4011s) for her and how wonderful. She ended up getting pregnant and had a baby shortly you know another year, very happy for her. And then very sadly her baby died from SIDS within a couple of months. Do you know, do you know, I don't know if you know but...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4028s)

I know exactly who you're talking about, I was very good friends with her. Yeah I was I was at the wedding too Helen.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4034s)

Yeah yeah and then the awful comments that came on afterwards which was oh well you know her baby passed with that, that's judgment because of what she did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4046s)

It was portrayed because of her sins that's why God had taken her baby. I that was shortly before I left and I can because I knew this person pretty well I can remember being I went down to stay with her shortly after the baby died and I can remember being so upset and angry that they were saying that. And it was shortly before I left. Yeah, yeah, I mean it's horrendous isn't it?

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4071s)

Yeah, and this is their forgiving God who had forgiven her and allowed her back into the church, yeah, but she still had to have judgment, yeah, by losing her little baby.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4080s)

They changed the narrative to suit them to keep that fear and control over the members and this is how it's just part of their narratives that keeps people in their places.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4090s)

Yeah and also going back to the sister that had the that was blind and had the guide dog, I was thinking when you were talking you know they require independence because they like you to rely on them, that's one so that you kept in there.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4103s)

Yep. Yep.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4105s)

Exactly.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4106s)

So Helen, how did it go for you the first few years after you moved into your friend's house?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4111s)

So I was only with her for probably less than a year. I got into my second year of A-levels. I did some of my A-levels early, which really helped because I was desperate to actually earn a living. I really felt at that stage, I just needed to get out. I love being with my friend and a family that was so good to me but I also wanted to move on and become a bit more independent have you know earn a bit more money so that I could maybe afford some of my own and I was 18 by this stage as well so I thought about it what should [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4147s) do and I went back to one of my original plans and I joined the army and that's what I did. and I'll see if I can show you some photos because it was how 80s is that. So on the right so I'm still at school at this stage and I've had my hair cut, I've had my ears pierced as you can see but I haven't got many pictures of sort of this era of me but still at school but obviously I'm still shut up at this stage but I've got my hair cut, I don't know what a cut that is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4180s)

Very worldly and amazing. It's a 1980s cut, we had perms Helen.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4187s)

Yeah, this was about a year after I left and I think I was perming my hair too. and then this was me enlisted uh in the army there uh so wow yeah it's so I just finished my training I'll just stop that. I just finished my training and I was in Watford and just spending a weekend in Watford with my with my friend Pam and I was in in the town centre on a Saturday afternoon and [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4221s) to put some rubbish in a bin and by the bin was Pam's cousin who was in the Royal Air Force and he, I'd known him you know for two or three years, he was very close to Pam, they've got on very well they were and so he was often around the house and I got to know him really well. 

We stood talking by that being, I said, I'm in the army now, by the way, so we had a lot more in common. We stayed talking for about two or three hours and we stayed in dresses, let's continue to write. And as soon as I got back to Guilford where I was billeted at the time, in a couple of days there was a letter from him and I got a letter almost every single day. By the end of the week there was a letter saying you know can we start going out, can you know can we meet, can we go on a date and yeah and I'm still married to him now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4276s)

Does he still send letters every day? Maybe text instead, yeah.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4280s)

Yeah yeah so yeah that's so that's really nice so that's sort of kept the connection with with Pam as well but yeah we've we've got married about and I've got left the army then, I only stayed in the army for 18 months and put my notice in to get married and yeah so we've traveled around quite a bit you know we had our kids, we've got three kids. But something happened 2001 and it's in the summer [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4311s) normal Saturday morning the post comes, I'm still in bed, Paul goes and gets a post he says oh there's a letter for you. Let's see the letter, I can see from the postmark it's Watford and I'm thinking oh my mum or my dad has written to me and it's not their handwriting. I open it up and I just shriek, absolutely shriek. It's a letter from my younger brother and his letter says he found my letter in the [filing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4341s) cabinet at home, my dad. 

So every time we'd move house I would write to my parents, so we moved 14, 15 times because Paul was in forces so we'd move every two years, we're constantly moving. Every time we moved I always wanted them to know where I was if they had anything they needed to talk to me about they could contact me so they always have my address and I wrote so they had and I just thought I don't I just had a feeling they just threw the letters away, I had no idea, okay but my dad had kept every single letter I'd ever written and kept them in this [filing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4371s) cabinet and my brother had found my found the letters, found the most recent one with my address and he'd use that to write to me. So that's a top tip to anybody, make sure your family knows where you are.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4386s)

And I would agree with that because I did the same, we didn't move much but I did the same with Andrew's parents, we always told them and I think I've may have said this before but I also sent our children's school photographs to them every year thinking they'll throw them away and after his mother passed away we went to see the family in his house and we found out she'd kept every photo so send one. Yeah, yeah and actually in the back room the latest photographs were out just the very small cameo were [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4416s) with her other grandchildren and that meant so much to us.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4420s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so you're right Helen, do keep telling them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4424s)

Yeah, yeah, our doors aren't shut.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4426s)

No, exactly. But his letter, he said that he didn't believe in what the the brethren stood for anymore, he wanted to leave and he was very unhappy in the brethren and would I help him. He was reaching out to ask if I would help him. I was just absolutely blown away.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4444s)

And what's the age difference between you two?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4446s)

10 years. 10, okay. 10 years younger than me, yeah. So he came, his, the four, there's four of us kids, so [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4454s) very close in ages about a year between us, I think mum had them all four of us in five years or something and then all of a sudden there was a big gap to 10 years and then our youngest brother came on so he was really, he was lovely, he was very spoiled by the last week, absolutely all adored him. so for him to reach out, he was probably the one sibling I didn't really know that well because I only knew him up to the age of six and I didn't know him anymore so all of a sudden now he's like 23 reaching out saying hey can you help [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4484s) leave. So I wrote back to him and I felt confident writing back because even as a child my mom would never ever open anybody's mail, she made a big thing of that saying I will never open mail, she never did. And I never saw her do it apart from my dad's, my mum and dad's mail that seemed to be you know you know their mail and they used to open each other's, that's fine. But it might be a bill, yeah, sorry. 

But as far as the kids never ever ever did she ever open them out. So I felt, but I was still really careful. I didn't post it from the suburb we were living [i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4514s) made sure I was outside of the suburb and then you know and I'm so it was wouldn't have the my postmark so I've reached to meet with him in a cafe in Royston, I think near Cambridge, dating time turned up then I'll be there. And he did and he turned up, he brought some photos, some recent photos with him, that was so good to see. you know we sent photos of my family I hadn't seen any and uh we had a long talk, had you know ate together and drank together. I said well this is a good sign [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4545s) eating and drinking with me so I think he should be okay. And we made the arrange I said okay well we're going to keep in touch we need to think about how we're going to do this in the meantime go and buy a mobile phone.

 And at that stage mobile phones were completely banned by the brethren. They were, they said yes and I'll definitely get one. He bought one within a couple of days and he texted me the number and I said I won't ever phone you or text you on that, you phone me and text me when you can and then I'll respond accordingly. So that's what he did and he keep it kept it very [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4575s) hidden. And so he continued having these conversations thinking about how we could make this work and then 9/11 happened and the whole world was going, felt like it was going a bit crazy and I reached out and said look maybe we just, let's just call things down for a few months and pick things up maybe in a few months. And you know I don't know I've just remember at that time that's what I said to him and it must have been because I think everything was just a bit you know on edge in every sort of facet of life but he [reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4605s) out and said absolutely no, it's almost like me was that at the age of 16\. 

No, I'm on a mission, I'm gonna leave this is what what my what's gonna happen. So I said okay well this is a plan and we concocted this plan together that he would, we would choose a date and it would be on a Saturday. He would say he was sick, he wouldn't go to the meeting, uh there so the rest of the family go to the meeting, he would stay at home, he would leave a note and he would, we would meet him at the house. We'd get [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4635s) pack everything up we'd have only probably about an hour if that but we would make sure we packed everything out, throw everything in our car and his car, he would follow us back, we lived about 130, 140, 40 kilometers, about 80 miles away. And we'd just then have to work things out, you know, with the fallout as it happened. 

So that was going to be our plan. And I wrote it all down in a letter and we picked on a date, picked on the date it would happen. And we'll also sort of set some ground rules about, you know, if you're going to come and live with us, this is what we expect from you too. because as brethren I mean there was just you know he was very very naive and I don't think he might be saying that but you know I wanted to make sure he knew what the boundaries were around us coming to live with us. 

Within two days I sent that off, within two days [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4689s) called me or he texted me and said call me now, call me as soon as you get this. So I called him straight away and he said I got home from work and mum was there, she'd opened my letter. And I was so shocked because that's certainly, why was she, so she knew everything. So the following week and I won't talk too much about because it's his story but I will talk about his story in a way that impact us and what we saw what we were part of. but this [matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4719s) psychological torture that he was put through that week after because obviously they told the priest, they told the brethren who then putting huge undue pressure on him to stay. They would come up they would see him after work at home one by one, in the end he just shut his door barricaded himself inside his bedroom. They would push notes underneath his door and money. They would come and talk through the door and then as soon as one went another one would come talking through the door at him. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4749s) was just absolutely intolerable.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4753s)

Classic love bombing.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4754s)

Yeah, yeah, very very much, very much so. We said okay this is enough. He said I need to leave and I said yes you do. We were working, I was at uni, I was at university at that time and like going to university late in life but I was eventually got to university. so we decided to do it on a Friday evening and obviously he told, he said I'm leaving on Friday evening, I'm I'm I'm leaving I'm I'm getting picked up or Paul's, Paul and Helen are coming down [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4784s) I'm going back with them. He was driving so we weren't actually going to pick him up, he was just going to you know try to follow us back. And so that was that was all planned. 

He knew, he said I think they're going to bring people, bring brethren to the house to stop me from leaving. And I said no they're not, that you know you're not going to be stopped from leaving, I'm going to be there and they're not going to stop you. And that's when Paul sort of stepped in and he said let's just calm this [down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4814s) and he said you know this is, just think about the effect this is having on your parents and I said yeah okay. He said I think just I should go and you stay here. 

Well that was like I can't not go but he was absolutely right, he was right. And I actually decided not to go because there was no doubt I was going to get very very emotional and Paul not having being in the brethren but knowing about the brethren because I've told, he you know told so much about it him about it and he'd so he knew as much as [anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4845s) any other outsider would know. and so he went down there. Now what happened was just absolutely incredible. So Paul decided to go down, he was in the Royal Air Force, he decided to go down wearing army fatigues.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4863s)

Nice, nice.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4866s)

Yeah like it, yeah, strategic move.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4869s)

Yeah, so he goes down there. He goes down, he goes down to the house and my dad and he knows that there's going to be an entourage and he goes to the house that opens the door and ushers him in. And he goes, Paul goes into the living room and there's just peeps that all around, men sat around because obviously the main lead, main lead of the local [locality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4900s) sitting in the biggest chair in the most prominent position. Ollie comes in, Ollie comes and sits right next to Paul and there and then they start and the oldest, the oldest peeb sort of led the way sort of starting off by saying you know how he, you know, my younger brother's turned his back on the JHS and the fellowship and I think it was Hales was in, yeah John, John Hales was in there. Yeah John [Hales,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4930s) as in you know he'd born, you've been born special, you know you're not going to find anything fulfilling. you know you're going to go the way of going to hell and you know don't go and leave, don't go outside the fellowships only death and destruction out there. 

Well Paul was not having any of that he said, so he said don't you talk to me about death and destruction. I've been in war zones all around the world defending events against death [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4960s) destruction. How dare you talk about something you know nothing about, you've got the faintest idea what you're talking about. And there's a complete silence.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4969s)

I can just imagine the room, well done, I can just imagine it and they've got they've got nothing to come back with that have they? No, they're so inexperienced they would be floored by that.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=4980s)

No, nobody ever talks to them like that. Nobody, no, no, and that's what I said to him, they wouldn't have, I was like I wish I'd been there, yeah. so, so then after a bit of silence, the conversation progresses on and a younger brethren brother makes a comment how, well, your sister left for the world, she's walking with evil and all of this, something similar. He was saying some very disparaging comments about me. Again, Paul was absolutely not having that. And he said you know how dare you talk to, how dare you talk about my wife like that in her parents' house, you show some respect, you need to apologize for what you just said. 

And nothing, just absolute silence. You [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5031s) they couldn't possibly do that because they'd lose face with all the other brethren in there if they ever dared, they'd do that. And so he said I've just had enough, I just had enough of hearing you talk about nothing, of talking about nothing that you know about and I'm going. And he's turned around to my brother and said are you coming with me or are you staying with this? And my brother said no I'm, he stood up, he said no I'm leaving, I'm coming with you. So they both walked out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5062s) my mum was obviously very tearful, she'd heard the whole conversation I think he went on for about maybe 45 minutes, 30, 45 minutes and my my hand Paul said to my mum you know we're gonna look after him, we're gonna keep him safe, you know you can talk to him, you know where he is and he'll he'll be okay, we'll make sure that he's okay and she just said no thank you. And so yeah they put everything in their cars and Ollie followed [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5092s) brother followed uh Paul and yeah he came to live with us for about six months and it was, I wouldn't say it was an easy time but it was interesting and there was a lot of learning that he had to do in getting a new job, applying for a job, going for interviews and I think...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5111s)

Again, again to pick up to people inside it is actually even though he's your own flesh and blood and your younger brother it actually is quite draining in a good way having to help somebody adjust if they're on their own. Uh if you say they have no idea how to apply for jobs, they have no idea where things are, we were all there once so we all get it, we all get it. But as you say it's not, you're pleased to do it and would never do any different but it's not easy is it?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5142s)

No, it's not. It's absolutely not.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5145s)

No, no. And and apart from being naive as well, like and I don't mean this in a negative way but we're also very ignorant because we haven't been taught how to adapt to all types of cultures and races and and ways of life. We haven't been taught how to just accept people and how to be ourselves, right? Yeah, we don't know who we are so we don't we don't know what to what to do.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5172s)

Yeah, we also don't know how to act in social situations, yeah, yeah completely completely agree yeah. And it was at that time very soon after because I'm talking 2001 and then 2002 obviously there was uh John Hales died and then Bruce Hales and then it was a review and then all of a sudden I'm hearing that you know brethren are having having some contact with their insiders and that they're allowed now to talk. I was right on the phone to my parents and I said so when are you going to start talking to me then? Because we'd had this bit of contact now with my brother leaving, I was, I felt quite able to now you know because they was because he was just shut up they were having a of contact with him so I was [muscling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5214s) in on that and getting in on the action bit and trying to get you know my you know some face, you know some time with them too. 

Of course they weren't really going that way but I I was then putting pressure on them and I said you know when when you're going to start talking to, my dad said well no that's that's not something we're able to do. I'm sorry, no, you've gone your way, you know, you've gone outside the brethren, you've gone outside the teachings, you've chosen a life of that you're taking. So we know it's not something we're able to do. I was [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5244s) upset about this and then my grandmother, my dad's mother died who's in the brethren, she passed away. And my my brother learned about this, I think he got a letter, he just got a letter from my parents saying just by the way grandmother died, she was buried yesterday day. and he was like you know that's terrible, I wasn't just terrible, I said that is disgraceful, I'm having that out, how dare he do that, how dare he not tell us before [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5274s) could have at least told us before. 

So I did and I really did not hold back and telling my dad how disgraceful I thought that was that he hadn't had the decency to actually let us know that she had passed away and that waited till you're dead and then tell us. And after I calmed down a bit I said well now will you let me know where she's buried so I can at least go and visit her grave? And he said well I'll have a think about that. Wow. Anyway and about [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5304s) week later it's really weird because it was on a Sunday my dad called me.

 He said I'm sending you a letter. He said I've written a little map out for where her grave is so you can go and visit her. I said okay well I'm going to go down next Saturday I'm going to go, I said as soon as I know I will go. So I said we will, I said Paul and I and the kids, we're going to go down next, I can tell you that now. and he said oh well okay well maybe we'll meet you there then. I was what [what,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5334s) do you mean? Wow, yeah, I know. So I was thinking well amazing okay, uh I didn't ask any questions, I didn't really want to know I was going to see them. that was going to be amazing. So sure enough, uh the first time I meet my parents since I left that day to go and live with Pam was in the cemetery car park.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5356s)

And this would have been the first time they'd seen your children then?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5360s)

First time ever, the first time. Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah. And we talked in the car park. It was just really lovely. There was no animosity. There was nothing about, you know, or any comments about me coming back to the brethren or whatever. It was just nice. It was just pleasant. It was friendly. It was, and we walked to the grave. This is where your grandmother is. Okay, it's a plot of land, you know. They hadn't even got the gravestone up yet. And it was a public cemetery and then we walked back and taught taught a long time and then my dad said well maybe would you like to come back to our house for refreshments. 

Yes I would, thank you very much that would be lovely. Wow. And then it was then he uh he looked at the two two kids who I said you know would you like to come back in our car and we can you can [try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5419s) and we'll drive you back to our house. So we went back to uh my parents house and spent another hour with them. obviously they didn't drink with us but they made us a cup of tea, we had refreshments we talked, went through photo albums. It was just lovely, it's just I can't explain just what's amazing afternoon.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5443s)

But this is this is what I would say, why can't that, why can't that's how it would be? Why can't you know you had that relationship with your parents that doesn't mean they can't be brethren. They didn't eat with you, we'll respect that. It does not mean they can't be brethren but they can extend, they can show kindness to you, they can talk to you as parents, they can embrace your children. Yeah, why why can that not be allowed? Why is that compromise? We respect they're not eating, drinking, will respect their Sundays and going to their meetings and to have that moment must have been so precious Helen.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5480s)

Oh it was absolutely incredible and I took a photo of that day and I'll see if I can, I'll share it because it's it's really, it really is special. they allowed us this is it here, so let's see if I can there we go, can you see that now?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5497s)

I'm just oh wow that's so sweet.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5502s)

Yeah so there's two kids, my parents in their house yeah these are the just on the left there I think there's a load of the photos there that we've been going through but that's...

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5510s)

How it could always be. Nobody has to compromise.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5514s)

No, that's such a normal photo isn't it? Yeah, it's two happy grandchildren with their grandparents and isn't that all we ever want? It's nothing to do with faith or belief it's just to families be able to not be split up.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5527s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5528s)

That's an amazing photo. I can see your similarities with your mum Helen.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5531s)

Yeah I remember your mom so well and I remember your parents well.

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5536s)

Yeah. Oh how lovely. But no it was, it was it was yeah, it was uh just amazing.

### [**Andrea Becker (MacKinnon)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5544s)

And your kids seem to seem to be happy there, how did they react because they've never met your parents before?

### [**Helen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5548s)

No they hadn't. I mean our daughter she was quite young, she would have been about three or four, three maybe four. I was actually just pregnant with our youngest okay at that stage and I told my parents we're having another one. And my mom turned around to me she said it'll be different this time, we'll make it different this time. Wow. I remember thinking I've spent so much hope that actually things would be different. And my my oldest son who's that picture would have been [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5581s) would it be now 10, 11 maybe. and he turned around when we got when we left, he turned around and we said mom your parents are so lovely.

 He's something he's so shocked because and I've never said it you know painted them in a bad way it was you know but they were this they were in this terrible religion that was you know not allowed to talk to me and I'd done something so wrong and they must have been so angry with me but he didn't see anger, he just saw loving [grandparents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5612s) who were interested in him and yeah it was a really special day and after that I was like well when can we come again? But you can come next week. And then they came to our house and we saw quite a bit of each other and I remember sort of pushing the envelope a bit and saying well maybe would you like Ben to come and stay with you for you know a couple of nights or oh no we can't do that. Okay I pushed it too far here yeah, yeah [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5642s) I said I've just, I said but I've said to my mom I said I'm just struggling so I don't know what what you can give and what you feel comfort, what your comfort level is. I said my comfort level is I'm open, I I'm free to be as you know give as much contact as possible. I said I'm just guided by you, I said you're not guided by me, I'm guided by you. 

So it's all in your hands I said because when I saw you for the first time I just wanted to see you all the time. And she said [Helen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5672s) I felt the same. Oh, yeah, it's so I I can't, I contact really was really good and she said to me is there anybody else you'd like to see and my dad my parents said is there anybody else you'd like to see. I said well I'd like to see two of my brethren friends my girlfriends that I grew up, I'd love to see them again. They said well we don't think we can make that happen. I said I'd love to see my grandparents in London, I always used to spend my summers with. And they said okay then within a couple of [weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5702s) it's like well when would you like to come and see them? 

I was like well next weekend. It was always on next weekend as soon as I could and so I went to London and I I spent some time with my grandparents and again it was just a lovely, my one of my uncles picked me up from the station and took me there and then at the end another uncle came and drove me back to and dropped me back off at the and station and at all times they were just so open so lovely. And then a few months later my grandmother died, my on my mother's side she passed away and I was [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5732s) glad I had that time a few months before but my dad told me straight away and said you know but your grandmother's passed away and I said well I'd like to go and see her and so they did they allowed me to go up to London and see her and I did say I'd like to also go to the funeral but then my mom said well not even I'm allowed to go to the funeral. 

And then I thought I stepped back I thought okay well she's not, it didn't seem right that I could that I went and I didn't and I chose not to go I just chose not to push that because it didn't seem, I couldn't believe that my [mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSJXacRECek&t=5763s) couldn't go to her own mother's funeral.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
