## Summary

When Martina's parents, Jerry and Alona Lyons, decided to finally leave the toxic cult of the PBCC, she was only 15. Martina shares with us her struggles of finding her feet in the outside world but most of all she shares her incredible life she has now. Martina attended the PBCC school, OneSchool Global (OSG) and suffered horribly on so many levels from the bullying, mistreatment and lack of care that we often hear about. Once she got herself situated in a public school, she excelled in every aspect that OSG had failed her.
Martina's journey extends beyond education. She shares the impact of therapy and the healing process after leaving the cult, emphasizing the importance of seeking support and cutting off negative influences. Martina highlights the value of family support, finding happiness in extracurricular activities and the therapeutic bond with animals. The conversation also delves into Martina's hopes for her future child, the opportunities and freedoms she looks forward to providing, and her embrace of new experiences outside the constraints of her upbringing.
Martina's unwavering spirit reminds us of the power of choice, resilience, and the pursuit of a life filled with love and purpose. Her story is a reminder that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=54s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we are here with Lane and our special guest Martina. Martina is Ilona Lyons' daughter who in May they will have left the PBCC for six years. Welcome Martina. We are so glad that you sent a message and asked to come on as your mom's podcast as you know kind of blew up and within 24 hours had over a thousand [views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=84s) already. So we know that it had an impact in there, so very grateful that you came on here. I'm going to hand the mic over to you and just let the viewers and listeners know where you're from and take us along on your journey.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=95s)

Hi my name is Martina Sharp as Cheryl said I am Jerry and Ilona Lyons's daughter. I'm currently living in Lancaster Minnesota which is about a half hour drive from them so I'm still pretty close to home.

But yeah, I, after seeing my mom's podcast, I kind of realized that there was a lot of stuff that she didn't get to touch on just because our perspectives are so different. So I kind of wanted to show the same story from my point of view.

We left on my 15th birthday. Oh, wow.

So, well, that was kind of, as you probably heard her talk about, that was kind of the day that my dad missed the very last morning meeting. And that was kind of it.

But yeah, so 15 years old is a very tumultuous time for any teenage girl.

So I definitely struggled the most out of all of us kids.

For sure, just because of my age, you know, like you're so delicate at that age. And then to be thrown into a brand new world, it was hard to try and figure out who I was as a person. And then also as a person that's not brethren anymore.

So that was a big, big change. But yeah, I was in the Brethren School from third grade when they brought you in in your little school uniforms up until the last quarter of my ninth grade.

That school is not something I would wish on my worst enemy, to be frank.

It was absolutely the worst experience of my life by far. Um I struggled a lot um with you know being bullied and towards the end of my time there a lot of the kids knew and a lot of you know their parents were talking they knew that we were questioning um so I spent the majority of my days literally sitting and staring at walls I didn't do any of my schoolwork. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=240s) ate lunch by myself.

Yeah. So when I transferred schools, I had a 14% in math class.

Probably I think it was like around 10 to 14% in Spanish, 23% in business class. I was absolutely failing everything. Um, when I finally got transferred over, um, I did one quarter in public school of my ninth grade. And I remember I would wear leggings and a skirt over top and I'd walk into the building. And the first thing I do is run to the bathroom and take that skirt off so fast. Um,and that was, that was pretty crazy, but instantly my grades started going up. It was very clear that it was not anything wrong with me, but with the school.

And obviously, of course, I was feeling a little bit more hopeful. So I was definitely caring and putting some effort into my schoolwork at that point. 

But I ended up graduating high school with high honors and a 3.9 GPA.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=318s)

Wow. Congratulations. That's incredible.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=320s)

Yeah. I, during 10th grade, I found out that most of my credits could not transfer over.

They were fighting with the Brethren School, trying to pull stuff over. They were asking for textbooks so they could at least see what I had learned to try and give me some of my credits.

But the Brethren School wouldn't give them or obviously a lot of the classes didn't even have textbooks. Um so I ended up having to redo my ninth grade year um I did online and I finished it during my senior year. I was doing algebra one and college algebra at the same time just to get everything done so.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=366s)

But so so some of the subjects basically they couldn't even provide the text for it to give you the credits at the new school?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=376s)

They wouldn't provide them um for some reason and I mean they couldn't you know.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=386s)

I wonder if some of them were it was like science and stuff too right which is a big one.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=392s)

Yep that they were trying to to get the textbook for and they wouldn't give it and if I remember right I mean it was like this thick I don't I don't think we ever opened it. And it very clearly, it wasn't up to standards, because they didn't want to give it over.

But yeah, even even my gym class was the credit wouldn't go. So wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=417s)

Wow, that really shows the like how their schools really aren't up to par. One other question I had when you were talking there is, can you tell listeners a little bit too about the differences you probably saw in students being at the Brethren School and then being at a public school?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=436s)

The disrespect is absolutely astonishing. Being in an environment in the public school where the classrooms were quiet and the teachers weren't, you know, getting walked all over. Like that was night and day difference. Um, it was crazy to see. I mean, the students ran the Brethren School. Absolutely. Certain students were a hundred percent in charge. They could do no [wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=466s) The teachers had absolutely no power to stop them. Um, and yeah, being in a, in a public school where the students are respectful, um everybody's quiet you're able to learn and ask questions like that was the hugest difference for sure.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=484s)

Did you find that accountability was different in a public school versus OSG the OneSchool Global of the PBCC?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=491s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=493s)

Yeah, um for sure and when you were struggling with your grades what what kind of things were offered to you to help you?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=507s)

There wasn't anything.

There was one teacher who I absolutely love to this day. She's my favorite teacher that really cared. She would bring my mom in and we'd have our little parent teacher conferences and she would be like, I see what's going on. I know you don't care. Because my thing is I wouldn't even do the assignments. Like I was just, my head was so messed up at that point. I was in such a fog that I just, I didn't care about school one bit. Um, but she would come in and she's like, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=540s) know, I know you don't care whatever. And we would sit there and she would actually pray with us. Um, we do during our parent teacher conferences, but at that point, it was like the only way to really fix it would be to get out. Um, and at that point I was the only one left in the Brethren School. And that's for me when it got very bad.

My brother was transferred over to public school when he was in fifth grade. So I believe I would have been in eighth grade.

And then my little sister did her fifth grade in the public school as well. And that would have been my ninth grade year. So my whole ninth grade, I was the only one of my siblings in the Brethren School.

So I was the only one that had to wear the uniforms. I was the only one that had to go to school till basically July.

And I was the only one that was in there dealing with, you know, everything that they were doing. So that was really hard for me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=604s)

So what do you think was the biggest factor in you not being able to want to be there or finish your assignments? Was it the bullying or was it that there was just no support or was it all of it?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=616s)

It was all of it um for sure the problem was that at this point people knew that there was something off, like they knew um I had definitely said some things you know where we would have conversations about Mr. Hales when we were on you know study hall or whatever and I would say things like, do you seriously believe that? Or like, I'm not listening to that, you know? And then kids started picking up on it. And I remember, I can't remember what I said, but I remember I said something about, you know, why are we all listening to Mr. Hales? You know, something along those [lines,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=657s) the whole room went quiet. And that was when I realized I needed to really keep my mouth shut if I was going to survive.

So after that I kind of shut down completely.

And I just, like I said, I would literally go there.

Their whole school system is based on that self-directed learning.

So basically the teachers were there to give you homework, not really teach you. And then it was mostly study halls like all day. So I wouldn't do the work. Didn't really have anything to try and even teach myself the work. Google was blocked. So yeah, I sat there and I stared at the walls and I didn't talk to anybody because at that point they were really catching on.

And there was, I remember one time I was walking to the printer to get something and I walked through the hallway and all their walls are glass. All the school walls were glass.

And one of the church elders was there. And I walked back to the classroom. He came and he pulled me out and he screamed at me in the middle of the hallway. Everybody could see, you know, everybody could hear. But this was probably a month or two before my parents finally took me out.

And what he was screaming didn't even make sense. I hadn't done anything. All I'd done was walk to the printer, but it turned into like, you need to grow up. You need to act your age. Like he screamed at me until there was tears running down his face. And this is a PBCC leader, elder. Yeah. He was one of the older gentlemen in the church. Um, I just call them elders now because it's the easiest way to explain them. Yeah um but at that point [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=769s) don't even know how he was connected to the school other than he would sometimes come in to be one of the lunch monitors.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=777s)

So in other words in other words you have a random civilian inside an educational institution screaming at children why are the police not called? He's not a teacher, he doesn't have any educational degree, he doesn't probably have pastoral training in any sense.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=795s)

No, no. And it was because at that point they were scared and they knew where my family was going.

And I don't know if it was like some last ditch effort. I don't understand it, but yeah, there was literally tears running down his face and I held myself together to the end of the day, but I came home and I cried and I cried because that was, I mean, number one, it's terrible to just get screamed at, but for everyone to be able to see it and you have like no idea what the heck just happened um yeah that was pretty bad so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=830s)

After that especially at the age that you're at, that's such a delicate age, it is such an age where you're trying to figure out who you are, where you fit in, you're building such a core part of your self-esteem right? My heart breaks for you having to experience that and I mean this isn't the first story where we've heard of these incidents, it's one of our first times we've had someone on here from OSG be able to tell the story of how they were treated in there [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=861s) we appreciate this.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=862s)

Yeah and just to make a point about these schools really quick um is in the normal world what you do is you have an educational institution, a school right, and you educate to a higher degree the people that are teaching the lower education level, right? Like high school or elementary school. So in other words, if you only have elementary school, you probably shouldn't teach elementary school. If you only have [high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=892s) school, you probably shouldn't teach high school, right? You have one up to teach one below. So Brethren members, elders, being involved in OneSchool Global is a high school graduate at most trying to facilitate a high school right they don't have the education to do this they should not be involved in these schools at all they're not smart enough they're not yeah they're uneducated.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=919s)

Yeah and I think that kind of brings up the point of it's hardly a school. I don't think it's hardly there to be a school other than for legal reasons kids are supposed to go to school.

They don't care about what you're learning, especially the girls. Being a female, I mean, your job is to graduate high school, work, get married, have kids.

I mean, you're not there to contribute to the business in any sort of way. You're not, your only contribution is to cook and have babies. So that was, I mean, another part. I remember arguing with my best friend about that. Like I wanted to go to college very badly. And this is when my whole family was questioning things. Um, and she was about the only person that I felt kind of comfortable, at least arguing my point of view with. Um, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=976s) I told her, it was like, I want to go to college. So I don't have to, you know, be a woman in here and cooking and cleaning and having kids like she's like well you can still work and stay brethren and I'm like I don't want to sit in an office all day which ironically is what I do now um but it's my choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYeLM3dGs2Us%26t%3D997s)

Use that exactly it's your choice.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYeLM3dGs2Us%26t%3D999s)

Um and she was like well if you don't want to be in an office you can drive a forklift. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1007s) like there's people I'm like I'm not driving a forklift like I want to do something with my life. Um I don't want to be just a wife and raise kids and stay at home and cook. I hate cooking like I never ever fit the bill to be a Brethren wife ever.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1027s)

In other words you wanted to make your own life instead of having a pre-planned book handed to you like this is your life.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1035s)

Yeah yep I yeah my dreams were way too too high for their standards.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1044s)

But which is good.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1046s)

Yes.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1048s)

So what did they what was the reaction when you said these kind of things you know that you wanted to go on?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1054s)

I do remember saying a lot of bad things about Mr. Hales to her. Um she was the only friend I had left and about probably two months before we actually left um I was told that she couldn't speak to me anymore so um that was a big whole mess. After we left, she wrote this [giant,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1084s) like nine page letter. And my grandma was working at the public school. She gave it to my grandma and my grandma gave it to me. And at the very end, it said, do not contact me unless you want help coming back. And I threw it away. Um, and I did not contact her again, um, ever.

And maybe two, three, three years later, I think I was like the beginning of my senior year, I get an email from her.

And she's like, I'm sorry, all this stuff. I want to apologize. Do you think that I could call you? I was like, we can meet in person because I knew she absolutely wouldn't do that. And of course, yeah, she wouldn't do that.

But yeah, I can't. I think she ended up calling me trying to apologize. It was like too little too late you're not going to try and get me to come back like this isn't going to work. Um and then I blocked every form of communication that she still had with me. Um but yeah that was the last kind of real interaction I've had with any Brethren.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1160s)

It's really painful to interact with them right? Like I've done it over the years you know, like reach back out to my family try and send them emails, try and be nice to them. Um listen you know read their stuff sometimes, not that they sent much but you know talking to some ex-member recently and you know he's like I hate my family it's like I've no love for them anymore and he explained it you know he's 70 years old now and he explained how he's like [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1191s) haven't been a part of his life in so long. Um they don't ever ask how he is or any any kind of thing in his life, so is there any connection? Should he say that he loves them how it's like loving something that someone who's already dead, there's nothing there's no necessarily connection back right?

 Um so when we like sometimes I think about it like this, like sometimes you hear true crime documentaries, right, about terrible things that [happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1221s) to children, right? Or Cheryl, your case, right? Now, let's say it's a family. Now, is it good to stay in touch with that family? Or is it better for that person to be completely separated from an abusive family, right? So sometimes, and it's not always family, it's sometimes members of church or whatever it is, but sometimes your life is really better not having them in it, you know, as hard as that is to say, but really not [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1251s) anything to do with them. Sometimes, not for everybody, but sometimes that is the best thing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1256s)

I think the thing is, is how that cult is set up with the separation rule is that there are no genuine, authentic friendships and relationships, right? They are so trained and indoctrinated to at the first sign of someone not believing or someone questioning there you find out very fast those friendships aren't true even the the connections we have within our family they're not true they're not authentic they are governed. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1286s) what makes this cult a cult is because even your own family even your own best friends are not authentic. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that but I mean like most of us that have gone out here right it's it's just heart wrenching it's heart wrenching having to go through the aftermath of choosing something different.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1309s)

It's it's like rejection right because like in a way they they reject you for who you are uh just on you like not believing like in this case right, like your friend can be your best friend in the world, but if you say, I don't believe in Bruce Hales anymore, they, just like that, right? Like a switch in the brain can just go, I can't even hear those words. Those words, they're just so awful and insane. They can't even be friends [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1339s) you anymore. And in the normal world, if let's say a Jewish person was sitting down with their friend and their friend said, you know, I'm thinking of converting to Christianity. The person would not lose their minds like they do in the Brethren. The Brethren act like you are joining a terrorist organization. When you say, I no longer believe in Bruce Hales, it is like to a normal person saying, I'm going to fight for ISIS, right? I want to go do evil, terrible, wicked things. And it's like, it's ridiculous.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1377s)

Mm-hmm. Yeah. I know my mom mentioned that taking us away from our grandparents and our cousins and our family was one of the hardest parts for her. But honestly, that was not the hardest part. Yes, I did miss them, but I do not anymore. Saying the word grandpa or grandma is so foreign to me.

It's super hard to miss them, honestly. I'm thinking mostly just angry now. Um, but that was definitely not the hardest part for me because it's like, yes, there are family, but, you know,

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1413s)

But they don't feel like it after, after the way they treat you when you change your mind about something.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1419s)

Family doesn't do that, you know? Um, so yeah, for me, that was definitely not the hardest part. I think the hardest part was probably, just, you know, pretty much everything else. Like senior year, I, well, I've, I've was diagnosed with anxiety when I was in kindergarten. So it is something that I've struggled with my entire life. I've been on, I had been on medication from kindergarten up until we left. Um, and then I, around the time we were leaving, and after we left, I also was diagnosed with, you know, severe depression. I was on depression medication up until [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1466s) time we left.

And it was really hard to see like, you know, my mom, she would, I would see her crying and I would be crying, but…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1484s)

How, how did you, how did you get back up on your feet after leaving? Because that's a huge transition for you. That was a massive transition for you, like you said, at that age. Let's try and give some hope to those teenagers in there. I mean, we have teenagers at that age, 15, 16, who are looking at leaving when they reach 18\. What kind of advice would you give to them for making that transition? How did you get through some of those very tough [emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1515s) obstacles?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1518s)

Um honestly therapy. Senior year um I really wanted to go to prom and mom said the only way that you are going to prom is if you agree to go to therapy. Awesome. Reluctantly I said yes. I still go to therapy at least once a month. I still notice when I don't go um but that made the biggest change and even my husband will say that from the time he met me to now like there's a huge difference.

So I highly, highly recommend going to therapy for sure.

Don't even try to interact. Just cut them off.

That was when I really started to heal was when I decided, you know, I'm blocking my grandparents' numbers. They don't want to talk to me. I don't need to talk to them. Nothing healthy is coming from this.

So just kind of making very conscious decisions to cut out the things that are negatively impacting you.

And then finding good friends.

And really, you know, just relying on the people that have your best interests at heart. For sure. For me, it would be my family. Like I stuck close to my family, but these, you know, a lot of them, if they do want to leave at 18, they're probably not going to have that.

So just, you know, I guess another thing you could do is find a good church.

I'm not a huge fan of church. I'm definitely a believer in God, but still stepping through, you know, going to church, hearing all the sounds like I, I can't do it. I was diagnosed with PTSD right after going to therapy.

So for a long time, it was like everything was a trigger. I would sit in school, I'd open my pencil case and I'd be like, whoa, that feels like they're Bibles.

But definitely 100% worth it. Even through every single bad thing that happened there and even afterwards, there was not a single moment where I ever, ever thought, man, I really wish I wouldn't have left. Like that was ever, ever, even ever a thought in my mind.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1668s)

And did you find extracurricular activities helped you? Like, what did you do to, because at that age, that's super important, right? That in the outside world had not been inside a cult coming out, age 15 is a time where you're really discovering a lot of who you are creatively extracurricular activities, social skills, how did you navigate that, what did you jump into?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1694s)

Horses absolutely 100 saved my life. When I was 14 there was some horses right down the road just out of town and I would ride my bike out there and I would pet them. And, you know, one day the owner came out and she's like, you want to brush them? You want to help me feed them? And then I started riding my bike out there every single day. And she taught me so much. And I am forever, forever grateful to that family. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1725s) ended up buying my first horse, which was one of those ones that I was taking care of. I bought her from that girl and I still have her. She's right out my window.

But I am, there is absolutely no way that I would have been able to do this without horses for sure. They were my saving grace, something, the one thing that made me smile. And I remember actually telling my mom that when one day when she told me I couldn't go out there for, I had to probably clean the house or something, but I was like, you're not going to take away the one thing that makes me smile anymore. And I think I probably broke her heart when I said that, but I mean, it was true at that point because we were still in. 

Um, and yeah, I would go and ride my bike if I needed to when I was out there. Cause you know, probably shouldn't be talking to worldly people, but yeah. So they definitely were the one thing that, that pulled me through.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1789s)

And looking back at when you left and to where you are now what do you think is the biggest thing that you feel you've gained from having the courage to leave and be able to do what you're doing and pursuing your dreams what is the biggest thing that like what what would you say to that 15 year old self as she's walking out that door what would you say to her?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1817s)

Um you're gonna find peace. You are going to have everything you ever thought you could ever want. Um and you're gonna be happy. Um I get yeah that's probably the main thing is peace like I'm sitting here I'm wearing pants I'm in my own house I have horses I have dogs.

Um I'm wearing earrings like that's just crazy. Um yeah that's I think the biggest thing I probably gained was peace like my heart was in turmoil for so many years. Um just watching my parents go through it and then you know trying to find myself um trying to learn the real world with a mom that's trying to learn the real world. That was hard [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1873s) she was about the same age as I was, you know, when it comes to real world experience. So she was trying to learn how to parent a teenager without ever having to be a teenager herself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1888s)

And I think that's the message that I want to give to those listeners inside the Brethren still, right like you're just this perfect example that shows how you're able to pick up the trauma from being inside a cult and still make so much of your life right? 

This isn't an easy task, it's not an easy task but with the right tools and the right guidance and the right I mean I understand the [horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1918s) thing I actually worked at a bar and my daughter had a horse and it is the it is is the most magical healer there is out there is being able…animals are such a therapy all in themselves right? And for that to not be a part of their life inside there is such a disgrace to what children need what teenagers need there's nothing like having a bad day [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1949s) you come home and an animal sits on your lap, an animal runs to you, you get to tend to an animal. It just, the regulation that your nervous system gets from it is a regulation that everybody should have a choice to have.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1967s)

Especially when on the flip side, they absolutely discourage getting any sort of mental health help in the first place. So not only do you not really get to rely on therapy or medication, they take away both things, you know. So…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=1989s)

They really damage people like that. Right. Like, I think it's very damaging to not allow interaction with pets. I think that's really weird and twisted trying to say that takes away your love from Jesus. But the pet's actually there. Right. And the other thing they don't allow, too, that I think breaks down some mental health stuff is sports. Right. So there's no team effort in sports [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2019s) sense of belonging to like a small group and things like that. I mean, they got the big group. They got the church. Right. But sportsmanship is a huge thing. And they don't allow that at all.

Competitiveness in sports, athleticism, just completely ignored.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2037s)

Yeah, that's one thing I will probably regret a little bit is that I didn't join any sports when I got into the public school.

I kind of just assumed it was a little too late for me because I didn't even know what basketball hardly was. So to go from not knowing what it was to playing it proficiently in two or three years. It was like, whatever. I've got my horses. I was working at the time too.

But yeah, I know my little sister's in volleyball and it has been absolutely awesome for her. Just the teamwork and getting to do those things and work towards something and see yourself getting better at it. It's so fun to watch her. Um and it makes me sad that they don't get to do that kind of stuff.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2090s)

Yeah yeah what are some of the first things that you tried to you know being a teenager and coming out?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2096s)

Oh boy um I I tried to do the teenager things but at that point my mom was still very much like kind of trying to shelter us because she didn't know how it was gonna work. Um so besides you know the obvious like wearing pants in public and hanging out with friends some but not a lot. UmI don't know and I had already had the horses at that point so…I went to a concert that was a concert. Um, I joined the youth group in town. I actually, I started going before we left. Um, I had one of the girls that went, she would drive through our back alley and I'd sneak out the back door and hop in her car and she'd take me to youth group. Um, so that was fun. I learned a lot at that church.

They would do fundraising and all the kids that were of age to be able to go would fundraise for this week-long youth conference down in Kansas City.

And while they were doing the fundraising, I was going to the youth group, but we weren't out at the time. So I knew I wasn't going to be able to go. And all of their fundraising was like church meals and stuff. Of course, I couldn't be at the church in the broad daylight.

So I didn't get to do any of the fundraising, but we ended up leaving that May. The conference was in July. And so even though we were out, I wasn't going to get to go, but somebody from the church anonymously funded my ticket. So I got to go on that trip. And to this day, I still have no idea who it was, but that trip absolutely changed my life.

I learned so much. I still felt really weird because it was a giant youth group, a nationwide youth group.

I learned a lot about God, but I still felt really weird because it was like a new Bible. And they were so farther advanced than I was. And like knowing about Jesus and God. Like, I mean, it's funny because they call themselves a Christian church, but I didn't know the first thing about it, like at all, you know, like who's Mary? I have no idea. So that was weird, but very, very, very life-changing.

I actually ran out of my anxiety medication on that trip. And when I got back, I never went back on it. Wow that was the end. That's incredible, my doctor actually said he's like I don't think you need medicine I think you just need horses so that was that was the end of that but that trip was incredible and just you know I didn't want to go on it I was really nervous um but [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2288s) very very glad I did. And I'm very, very glad that someone was generous enough to, to put forward that money for me to go because it’s absolutely life-changing.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2302s)

Probably really helped in your transition later, right? To see that there was other normal people out there, normal Christians.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2308s)

It did. It did. Um, it made it, I would say it probably helped a lot because I went with a group of girls um that were in my some of them were in my class they went to the same school as I did so it was also kind of a good way for me to to bond with them and get to know them and then

I think it made school a little easier too but it took me out of my shell a lot at the very beginning because that, I mean that was two months post leaving so it was a big deal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2340s)

Going back to OSG, what would you what would you say to them if you were able to sit down with somebody in OSG and they they actually listen to you what would you, what would you go back and tell them, what would you say to not to the teachers but, okay maybe it is to the teachers, but more so to the brethren that are so governing how the teachers respond to things um to the the bullying that happened in there. What would your advice be going [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2373s) and what would you want to say to them?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2377s)

Um I'd probably say a lot of swear words first um but kind of just like open your eyes you know. Um focus on the kids not so much your businesses, like you know, give them sports, stop segregating the males and females that's the most awful idea ever. Luckily that happened after I was out of there but [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2409s) take advice from a public school like, see how they run things and you know, give them textbooks, yeah they there's a lot of advice that they should be taking.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2420s)

Do you think there can be a properly run school with the hierarchy that runs within the PBCC?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2431s)

No, definitely not.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2432s)

Yeah.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2435s)

There's I mean no, somehow the people that they hire that stick around are, I don't know how to explain it but I know like where our, one of our superintendents was like so buddied up with them he was trying to join the church. Wow. So they hire these people with very similar minds and then they're so easy to just mold and control so unless they're going to college themselves and getting teaching degrees there's I mean there's not really any chance. [Any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2476s) teacher that is a good teacher leaves. Um I know some that were, that worked there that said like I'm gonna stay here for the kids until I cannot physically handle it anymore and they have since left.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2494s)

Um well I feel like these teachers join an education or get an education career because they want to educate children, right? And, you know, like the word misinformation, right? Disinformation. Well, it's miseducation what the Brethren try and make the teachers teach, right? They try and dictate what the teachers are allowed to teach because of their narrow, uneducated views.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2522s)

Yep. It's catastrophic how they run their schools. I worked in with kids for 12 years and it is very near and dear to my heart. I homeschooled my children. It's just, it breaks my heart that they run the schools the way they do. And I mean, they run it because it's their, it fits their mold. But I just think of all the children inside these schools that have dreams and [aspirations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2553s) to be a part of the puzzle that's out here to help heal and fix some of the problems we have here, they're stuck in there and they don't get to get that education to be able to be a part of the bigger puzzle that we're looking for right? To me every human fits a puzzle and yet we have these cults that are created that keep these children completely confined and closed in to becoming their full potential. Yet what if one of those children in there are here [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2584s) bring the next level of healing, say for cancer or for diabetes, or you don't think the geniuses are in there. We've heard the teachers talk about them. The geniuses are in there. And it's just, like I said, it's catastrophic at how they are allowed to legally run the schools that they're running.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2608s)

And it doesn't make sense because, you know, you'd think that if they were the one true chosen church with all the perfect people in it they would just be full of Einsteins and Gandhis and uh you know um Stephen Hawkings and you know what I mean they would just be like overflowing with with the brainiest and smartest people in the world \-  but I haven't heard of an invention coming out of the peebs, other than pyramid scams, ever.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2634s)

Yeah that's you know there is Einsteins in there and there is um I was talking to a woman that taught there and she's she mentioned one particular girl she's like she absolutely has every bit of potential in her to be like a doctor a brain surgeon like she's incredible. Um but yeah she's gonna just graduate and go to work for a few years and get married and have kids and cook..

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2664s)

And that's whyI hope if there's some teenagers in there, they're listening to Martina's story today and realizing that, you know, there's a life outside and it's much happier. And you don't have to grow up to be, you know, just a stay at home wife that has Brethren babies, you know, that is not the top of your potential. And neither is a Brethren boy thinking that he has to run a business, you know, in his [future,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2694s) that is not the top of your potential. There is so many more millions of things that you can do in your life, right? Listen to this story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2702s)

I'm going back to the bullying that you encountered. What, what attempts did you guys do to try and conquer the bullying or to address the bullying?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2714s)

Um, I didn't do anything.

When it came down to it, they turned it around and I was the bully. I was actually terrorizing people, according to one of the teachers. Well, actually, no, she was the principal. She emailed my mom and I was terrorizing a student. And my mom's like, can you please give me some examples?

And I'd have to find the email again, but it was something along the lines of saying no, I don't think that's right to a particular student. And not doing things the way she wants them done.

And there's, you know, your example of the students kind of run the situation. So…

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2761s)

And that's terrible for those students because life's going to punch them right in the face later, right? Like, it's just going to really, really hurt later in life when you grow up in a school thinking that you just run the shit, right? And that things bend into your way.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2779s)

Oh boy.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2780s)

I feel bad for them.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2783s)

Yeah. Nope. And this, this teacher that I was talking to, I mean, she said that, that girl that I was terrorizing, um, ran the school up until she graduated, which I a hundred percent believe. Um, but yeah, so I was so low on the totem pole, um that I mean towards the end since I wasn't really talking there was nobody that was really giving me crap other than the guy that came in and screamed at me to grow up and act my age. I don't know apparently whatever I did at the printer was terrible.

But yeah I mean I just kind of hid.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2830s)

Did you ever come across anybody who had been sexually abused throughout your school or no?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2837s)

I knew of some things. Um I

I encountered a little bit of it when I was really little. Um, but I've heard more since I've left about what's been going on in the school since then, just from teachers and stuff. And a lot of it is like, even like incest, like siblings and yeah. Gross.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2877s)

But I mean when you segregate males and females that much they don't know how to act. So well and the teachings aren't there in the education system too right right.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2890s)

Yeah like those particular, this before um we didn't have a science textbook, we had one where the whole biology section was just taped off I mean you didn't you couldn't read it \-  they they covered it up. Um.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2905s)

All of biology but that's a whole. Learning about science you can't just delete biology.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2913s)

Yeah you I mean like the the whole female reproduction system nothing you know the sperm and the egg it didn't exist like you didn't learn about any of that. Um I remember we would go on field trips pretty often and we went to um a I think it was like a human rights museum which I think is hilarious now thinking about it you take a cult to a human rights museum.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2942s)

Very ironic.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2943s)

Yes but they actually they brought chaperones just to stand in front of the gay section so no kids would walk in there you know, like the gay rights they took, they had chaperones stand in front of there so no one would walk in.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2957s)

We heard about this, it is mind-blowing that you have to be that ignorant to not be in a human's rights museum and then be like I'm not allowed to look at part of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2973s)

Like yeah something's wrong there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=2975s)

And I hope again here's another point I just want to point out to the listeners inside there is the absolute ironic behavior of that you're at a human rights museum but not allowing the rights of a human to be seen, right? It just doesn't make sense. It's such hypocrisy of… you know I just I really think that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3005s) school system within there.

 I mean they are trying, I've heard they've brought an anti-bullying system since we've brought out these podcasts there's like these safeguarding um things every household had to do but they're very very vague they're very check the box and it's more for um a show for the government to keep their schools going versus it actually having a purpose and dealing with an issue. And that's what is sad about all of this [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3036s) that their solutions are never to deal with an issue their solutions are always how do we cover this up, how do we keep this so we're government, the government is still funding, how do we keep our charity status? Everything is always for show versus it being a solution.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3054s)

Oh absolutely like I don't know whether to laugh or be really mad when I see things like RRT posting their kids dressed up in Santa costumes. Like, what is that? Or celebrating Halloween. Yeah. Yes. Like that's a hundred percent for show like that. It's crazy. It's mind blowing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3075s)

So you're talking about how you had seen other things that were different perception with your mom. What else was there that was different that you viewed than your, than your mom viewed?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3085s)

She talked about um you know crying being really depressed um I saw that I saw all of it. I didn't see her go downstairs to a room we never used and she would just sit and cry and at that point I was probably maybe 12 or maybe even younger um and I just remember just feeling so bad and I didn't understand any of it.

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

This is before you guys left then?

**Martina Sharp**

 Yep yep this would be before I left and this was when she was definitely questioning it. I [always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3116s) knew that she was questioning it.

And she would, she would always say like, you know, what they just said in that meeting, do not listen to it. Or she'd be getting us ready for the meetings. And she'd be like, just don't even listen.

So I think I was pretty lucky. I would say I didn't really get brainwashed because of her being proactive and kind of, you know, telling us things like that.

But I remember when they really started trying to make an effort into getting the ball rolling so we could leave. I was working at the grocery store, so I would have been 14\.

And I, at this point, was pretty involved with everything that was happening. And she had told me that dad might be able to get a job. And if he was able to get this job, it could mean, it would mean that we were going to leave.

And I remember it was like the day where we were going to hear, and I was working at the grocery store just you know beeping things and um she texted me and she said that the job fell through and I was devastated I 100 percent thought we had absolutely missed our chance and we were never going to get out, like that was our one shot and we missed it. Um I was really mad that we couldn't just like leave, because I didn't understand the whole like money aspect of it, you know like having to have your finances in order all that stuff like all I knew is I wanted to be out.

Um so that was kind of like now I understand it and I wish that I wouldn't have been so angry at her sometimes you know when we couldn't just leave.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3241s)

So you were like 15 you know when you laugh like it's I mean what 15 year old that's been inside a cult understands a process and the responsibilities that a mother is going through you wouldn't understand it you know.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3254s)

No but that was I was I was old enough to like be involved in the decisions but I wasn't old enough to really understand why they were being made so I was I was very upset and I remember I was like trying not to cry and there was people coming in and I was like trying not to cry as I was checking them out and that that was a very very hard day. Um but everything ended up working out and we actually got to leave pretty quickly [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3284s) that um with this new job and yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3291s)

Did any relatives besides your grandparents try and reach out to you after?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3296s)

Um no my uncle would come to our house occasionally before my parents were actually finally kicked out.

He did tell me I should work at the post office.

And I was like, there is no way in hell you're going to come in here and tell me to work a government job when you're not even allowed to work a government job. Like, or he one day told me I should be a nurse. I'm like, buddy, you can't even go to college.

Why are you telling me what to do with my life, like you can have some sort of opinion when you decide you're actually gonna be in it, like so yeah I was really mad, I think that was the first day or the maybe the only time I've ever actually like raised my voice at him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3351s)

Um you know that's a real trait a very misogynistic trait the men from the PBCC have in and out I think it's a hard trait to leave is, I mean, we talk to a lot of insiders in there and I do, I find sometimes the men very hard to talk to. They don't realize how misogynistic they're being towards comments that they make to me. Right. And it is very triggering for me. I've had to take breaks because they don't, they don't understand when [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3381s) are telling you to do something, or this is the way that they, you should do it it comes across so misogynistic it just doesn't have any ounce of a variable for your own choice in it right? 

It just comes across as like well this is just what you should do and it does, it just steers through your body and you're like oh man I forgot, you just, you forget how the men are just in control in there.

 

**Martina Sharp**

[Absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3412s) yeah yeah.

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

But I mean I I think it's it's a it's a behavior and a trait for any of the men that have left or are in there that you need to learn how to listen to yourself listen to like, am I giving this female or am I giving this woman that I'm speaking to an opportunity, am I saying in a way that gives this woman an opportunity to still have her own choice. That's what it comes down to is that you are not above us, right?

A man is not above a female. And I will say that very firmly that that is the one thing that needs to change. We are equals. We walk hand in hand. I have a 50% of a voice, just like you have 50% of a voice. And I think if we're going to get anywhere in this movement, we have to understand that we've got to realize that females have just as much of a say as a man does.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3472s)

I think it's deeply ingrained in the very deep misogyny and like we are,like just that saying alone grinds my gears “head of a household” what is that? What is that the decider like  I'm sorry I hate that term. The brethren were all about that, my dad would say that all the time “I'm the head of the household I make the shots in here” why what point did you like exactly right the women's [pants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3502s) but in the brethren it's just so prevalent. And didn't they say recently in a video or something that “oh brethren can, female members can own businesses.” And it's like what? There's two you know.

Would you say Martina that that's one of the things that you are very grateful for is having your own voice? And maybe I mean you're married you're expecting you're in this whole new world, what is that like being in a relationship and a marriage outside of the PBCC after watching what your parents went through?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3546s)

It feels absolutely I mean light years different obviously I was never married in in the brethren, um but just like I mean I got married in Vegas like.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3561s)

That's awesome.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3562s)

You know and I I mean we had talked about when we had talked about our wedding we had talked about you know if we were gonna do something for the family and I was like, I don't have any family to come, so um the only time I thought about my grandma was after we had just gotten married and I was like I wonder what she'd think if she knew I got married in Sin City like the biggest like F you. Um but I mean yeah you just I get to make choices I got to [marry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3592s) who I wanted. Um um it's, I mean the difference in the men is crazy like he is the most loving kind helpful.

Like you don't see those traits in the Brethren men at all I mean he would never ever ever ever tell me “I'm the head of the household” like I would laugh if he did honestly like it's just it's never worked like that. We've always been very 50-50. Yeah. I actually bought this house before we were engaged or [anything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3634s)

So it was my house. I asked him to move in with me. I mean, so that was very empowering too. Like, you know, to be able to own my own property. And, you know, that's not something that a lot of brethren women would get to say, especially at 20 years old.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3656s)

Yeah, that's a very good point. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3660s)

And when is your baby due?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3665s)

We are due February 29th. It's a leap day.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3670s)

Wow. Congratulations.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYeLM3dGs2Us%26t%3D3671s)

Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3672s)

And what, sitting back and looking at the gifts that you're going to, and the opportunities you're going to be able to give this child, like what would, what are the biggest moments you're looking forward to and being grateful for leaving the PBCC now that you're pregnant?

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3693s)

I am very, very, very grateful that I will be able to give my child two wonderful sets of grandparents that will never, ever not be in her life. That is a huge thing. She's going to have family.

She's going to get to wear pants. Very excited for that. I'm so excited to do things like celebrate Christmas um things like that I mean that's it's super exciting. I'm very excited for her to be able to have everything that I could not have as a child because of that. A dog, that's awesome, I'm gonna have a dog.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3733s)

And that's the biggest thing that we as mothers like I found the same thing and what I was able to give my children, and you just you look at these babies and you're like wow the gratitude when that baby is placed in your arms of being able to give it everything that you didn't get makes it that much sweeter. 

Oh well thank you so much [Martina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3763s) for coming on we really appreciate you sharing your stories and being able to open up a door of opportunities to those that are listening from inside because we know that they're going to be listening to this. Your mom's podcast absolutely hit the fan inside there. And I think it's really important that they hear your story coming from the age of 15 and being able to [overcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3793s) what you overcame because most of our issues stem from being inside such an isolated indoctrinated cult that when you finally get out and you get the therapy, I'm a huge huge advocate of therapy. I still go every two weeks.Iit is possible these opportunities, you have the ability to be able to shake it off and gain the tools to be able to create a magnificent life [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3824s) here. And you are the perfect example of someone who left at 15 being able to get married, get a house, you know, find the things that light your soul on fire and to live what we're supposed to be living on this planet. This is what it's all about. This is, you could you still believe in God. I mean, you might not be going to church every Sunday, but it hasn't affected your faith in the sense that you still are who you are. You just get to be the brighter [picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3854s) of who you are.

Thank you for coming on. We really appreciate it.

### [**Martina Sharp**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYeLM3dGs2Us%26t%3D3859s)

Thank you for having me.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3861s)

Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeLM3dGs2Us&t=3861s)

Take care, everyone. Until next time, much love to everybody.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
