## Summary

Dr. Richard Marsh had a stellar career starting as an engineer on the famous Concorde supersonic aircraft, moving on to found a pioneering robotic submersibles business, then moving on to sonar technology. Now retired, he lives in a beautiful 1765 red granite “laird’s house” in the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland, owns a small fleet of vintage cars, hosts the annual Lonach Highland Games on his estate, and enjoys occasional visits from King Charles III who lives nearby at Balmoral.
This successful and fulfilling life had a most tragic and unpromising start when at 17 young Richard was ejected from his parent’s house and forced to fend for himself in a caravan (travel trailer) – due to the cruel edicts of JT Jr – his only crime being that he disagreed with the doctrine of separation.
The brethren’s cruel mistreatment of Richard continues right up to the present time, when the PBCC only thought to notify him of his brother’s death AFTER the burial…
An inspiring and thought-provoking interview with a truly remarkable man.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGxPbN6IWH30%26t%3D55s)

Good evening everybody and welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here with Ann and Ross and we're joined by Richard Marsh Jr. and Richard Marsh Sr., who is Richard Marsh Jr.'s uncle.

Richard Sr., thank you very much for joining us. Perhaps you could just start right at the beginning and tell us about your life in the Brethren and why you left?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=84s)

I didn't actually leave, I never joined but I was kicked out.

The whole Jim Taylor Jr. separation, not eating with people thing, really bubbled up between 1959 and 1961, I think. In 1959 I was 15 years old, and so it was a period of two years where these crazy meetings, everybody was whispering in corners. I was asked to break bread, I'd accept this, this not eating with the egregious sinners outside, and I couldn't.

After [lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=120s) of heavy sessions with my father, a fanatical brother, not Richard's father, the other brother, I just couldn't make any sense of it. I just decided this was not Christianity as I knew it. And then my famous thing that Richard has already said many times, I remember saying to my brother, "Are you telling me," his name is Gordon, "Are you telling me Gordon that it's a mortal sin to have a cup of tea with the local vicar who presumably was a Christian?" He said, "Yes it is, you mustn't do that." I said, "Well I'm sorry, I want no part of that."

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=151s) it got quite nasty after that. I got a lot of, quite a lot of abuse and I was, I was 16 by now I suppose, I was put in a very cold caravan in a field outside Cambridge and really had to make my way in life ever since. I think Richard told me the other day or last year that I've got 65-70 nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews, and apart from Richard, I've never met any of them. Totally cut off.

Richard's mother, I tried to phone her a year or two ago, she just put [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=181s) phone down. It's a cruel, inhuman, certainly it's not Christian, it's the most appalling abuse. So I've got an entire family that I know nothing of. I've just had to marry my wife and have my own children and that's my family now, along with Richard Jr.

I remember being told by my brother that of course I was destined for poverty, penury and all sorts of horrible things. I wouldn't have a career, I wouldn't get anywhere and it was ridiculous trying to make my way in the big bad world. I'm pleased to say I did very well in the big bad world and everything's gone swimmingly, but that's…

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=218s)

Just to put it into context for perhaps viewers that don't understand that big change that happened around the late 50s, try and explain how it was in the Brethren prior to the eating rule and why and how the eating rule came in and the impact it had. Obviously on you it had a huge impact, but on the Brethren generally.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=240s)

A total character change, a shift in everything. Up until 1958-59, the Brethren were, yes, it was, I was going to say, let's finish one sentence before I start the next. The Brethren were a happy, cheerful bunch, a lot of socializing, a lot of people coming to our house in Cambridge. We had a big house in Cambridge and we had all the undergraduates from Cambridge colleges coming to see us who were Brethren. We had tennis courts and it was great fun.

The only downside was I couldn't join the combined cadet force at school and I had to pretend I had a television. I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=270s) have a television at home. Other than that, it was a very relaxed, happy, natural family life. Then Jim Taylor Jr. ruined all that and ruined several people's lives in the process ever since. So yes, the change in character of the Brethren today, who are a closed, suspicious cult, compared with the happy evangelical people I used to know, is remarkable.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=295s)

And at that stage, so we're talking sort of mid-late 50s I imagine, what was the commitment to going to the meetings or the church services like? Was it particularly heavy of a week or?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=308s)

Well I suppose being brought up in it, one took it for granted. So you were three meetings on Sunday, and Monday evenings, and Thursday evenings. So yes, it was four or five, six meetings a week. I was bored stiff, I must confess. I sat at the back reading books I shouldn't be reading.

But I just took it as part of life and I had lots of happy things going on, lots of friends in and out of the Brethren. I was sent to a very good school. And so, I just accepted that there was a bit eccentric, that I had to explain to my closest friends that I got some mad parents, but I could live with it. We could live with it today. It was a, as I say, it was a warm, evangelical, happy atmosphere. Now it's a suspicious, closed, cruel, nasty, mendacious atmosphere.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=355s)

Yeah, very much so. And presumably through your school days, although you were part of this church, you still mixed and ate and drank with other school children and there was no changes there. So this introduction of no eating, it was Jim Taylor Jr. wasn't it, that said what he was, I mean, was it he said you wouldn't eat with anybody you didn't break bread with? Was that the kind of edict that he...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=384s)

Yes, that's right. He, yeah, is it 2 Timothy 2 verse 19 or something? There's something about not eating with unbelievers, yes. And he jumped onto it and just applied it rigorously and fanatically, and have done ever since. And it's just destroyed families, destroyed so much.

And children not being able to go to university is one of my particular bugbears. I'm with you there. Utterly cruel and inhuman. The fact they have a charitable commission status with the UK government drives me bonkers. Absolutely [ridiculous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=414s). So yes, it all began with not eating with sinners, in inverted commas, and that then the separation has got more and more fanatical ever since.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=426s)

That's okay. We were just talking about how things changed in '59 and the eating, but then you were saying that it was an edict that you didn't feel was right and that led to your expulsion from the family home, from the church, from your friends.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=443s)

And the prospect of going to a decent university and everything else, yes. I mean it was brutal, but I just couldn't accept it. I just thought this is absolute nonsense. I was only 17, I think, when I was put out of the house. 17\. Yeah. I thought if I don't do this, my life is going to be terrible in the Brethren. It's just going to constrain, restrict me. I'm not going to see the world, I'm not going to get a decent career. No, thank you.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=474s) I didn't have any conscience. I just absolutely fundamentally knew in the core of my soul that it is not Christian, totally a non-Christian edict. You can't have a cup of tea with a local vicar, it's just nonsense. It still makes me angry.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=490s)

Yes, yes, I can appreciate that. So were you still at school at this point, in the latter years of your school?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=496s)

Yes, I left, yes I was, yes.

And I went off and I managed to earn some money working for a local architect when I was 18\. I managed to get myself down to London, to the London Polytechnic as it was, and I managed to get a degree in aeronautical engineering. From then on I went and did wonderful things with Concorde and all sorts of other things, but no thanks to my family, I have to say, sadly.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=524s)

No, no. And just out of interest, hi, yeah, just out of interest, how did your parents, especially your mother, react to you being, you know, there must have been some emotion there.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=538s)

Yeah, they were heartbroken. I mean, to be fair to them, it hurt them more than I think it hurt me. They were almost in tears, but they just said they had no option. I had to leave the home. They bought a pretty grotty caravan about six miles out in the country in a field and that's where I had to go on a bicycle so I could get back to town.

And yes, even my fanatical brother, certainly Richard's father David, who was a much softer, kinder, more intelligent man, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=569s) were clearly very upset at what they were doing to me. As I say, more upset than I was. So it was, I, it sounds awfully pompous, but I absolutely forgave them. They just believed they had to do it. I felt no resentment to them at all. I just resented the system, I resented Jim Taylor, but my immediate family I loved dearly and wouldn't have a bad word to say about them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=591s)

I often think that it's almost harder for those left behind because I've got freedom. My five children haven't, my parents haven't. And you know, the heartbreak for them. Yeah, just interested to know how your mother reacted because my own grandmother did the same thing to two of her sons in '59.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=618s)

And it's not only the heartache is it, there's a stigma attached to those that are left in, that they've got somebody that's left, and it's a stigma that carries with them.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=631s)

You mean a stigma of those who remain in?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=637s)

They have an errant son. You know, there's a stigma attached to them because of that.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=645s)

Well, I can't apologize for that. They frankly deserve it, but there we go.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=650s)

It reminds me very much, it's stirring a childhood memory. I have an uncle who left at a similar time to yourself, Richard. I never knew him. I was born in the Brethren after he left. I burst into his life much later in life.

And I remember being at his parents' house, my grandparents' house, one day. I must have been about eight or nine, and we were looking through some family photos, and my grandmother found a photo of my uncle. And she welled up and said, I think that's cruel.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=690s)

That shows how weird their mindset is, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=695s)

Doesn't it just?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=696s)

Their mindset is absolutely abnormal. They do nothing wrong. They're all absolutely right. And anybody who says anything against them is totally wrong.

In the 21st century, for families to split up because you don't believe you could have a cup of tea with somebody is unbelievable. But we kind of all accept it. But just think about it, it's a most ridiculous proposition. And I say, I've got this 60 or 70 people in Cambridge that I'm never going to see, never will see, and take no interest in me. And frankly, I could take no interest in them. And that is meant to be Christianity.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=736s)

It's just nonsense, absolutely. It's not a good advert for it, really, is it? It's not a good advert for humanity.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=741s)

It's a cult. It's a groupthink cult. And the more you attack it, the more it strengthens its groupthink and the more they draw together barriers around themselves. And how on earth we ever get into them and then get the thing to sort of splinter from inside, I have no idea. Richard's doing some very clever things there, but it's very difficult.

There's so many cults. Nazism was a cult. The SNP here in Scotland, I oppose literally, I don't like the Nats that’s in Holyrood, that that's a cult. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=772s) mean it's frightening. It's a weakness of the human psyche and character that people get these things, believe them completely, and nothing, but nothing, all the logic on the planet will not alter them because that's their truth. And their truth is the absolute truth, and it's the only truth. It is, of course, rubbish.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=792s)

And it's fascinating because there must be plenty of people still in the Brethren, like Anne's parents, that can remember the times in the 50s, for example. I mean, my mother joined the Brethren in the 50s and said exactly like you, Richard, that it was a happy, evangelical church and she felt very comfortable and very welcome going in as an outsider, sitting down, just being part of the church.

And also had to face the change around the '59, '60 time and then tell her parents that, "Sorry, I can't have anything to do with you anymore," and so on. You wonder how people that can remember that actually manage to reconcile that in their heads, or do they not allow themselves to reconcile it in their heads? Do they just not think like that?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=844s)

Do you mean the Brethren who are in the Brethren?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=846s)

In there, who could perhaps remember a freer time.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=849s)

Yes, yeah, that's a good question. I think they thought they were all too sloppy, loose and undisciplined. And they justified by saying, "We're now right, we're now on the right path. We weren't then. We let people in and have cups of tea at the kitchen table, quite wrong. And now we've got it right."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=870s)

Yes, I think you're right. If they think about it at all, one can only imagine that's how they think. So you left in your late teens and you did go on and get yourself well educated and married and had a family and had a happy life, I trust. Yes. One day you got a phone call from a member of your family or something, didn't you?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=894s)

Well, my son got it first. This is Richard Marsh. And my son Jonathan said, "No, you don't sound like my father." And he said, "No, no, I'm your cousin." And at first, apparently, Richard will tell the story, apparently Richard didn't ring us for a long time because he thought we'd reject him and not speak to him or something.

And it was delightful. I met him at Aberdeen airport a month after the phone call, I suppose. And he's just the dead spit of his father. And he thought I was a dead spit of his grandfather. So we did, and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=924s) been a great joy to us. He’s in Canada of all places, but it's been lovely to have him around.

He's family. He was put through unholy hell, if you'll forgive the language, by the Brethren. I mean, just the way they withdrew bail on him and chased him. And you know, probably, I don't know, Richard, people keep me under the table if I'm saying something wrong, but the whole business of putting private detectives on him in Canada and so on and so forth. What were they trying to do to him? It's very sinister, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=955s) dark and evil, and it worries me a lot. I hope he's free of all that now. By exposing what the games they're playing, of course, that was the best thing to do. It stopped them, stopped them misbehaving.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=966s)

Yes, by keeping him in the public eye as a measure of protection.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=970s)

That's the only way to protect him, yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=972s)

Yeah, yeah. So over the years, I mean it's obviously been some years now, and you haven't had, apart from Richard and your family in your life, what contact have you had, if any, with your brothers and your parents when they passed away? What has happened on that front for you?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=992s)

I gate-crashed my parents a couple of times in Cambridge and sort of embarrassed them into letting us in the house. And my brothers came to see us in a hotel once in Cambridge about 10-15 years ago. And of course, you may or may not know that both Richard's father and my other brother Gordon died at Christmas and the Brethren made absolutely sure we knew nothing about it so we couldn't go to the funeral. So yes, it's been very, very, very limited contact [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1022s) over what is it now, 60 years or something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1027s)

Yeah. So did you, and I'm trying to think of it because, did you contact your parents say, when you had your children or did you not feel that that was something you could do because it wouldn't be well received?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1039s)

I try to obey the sort of normal rules, you know, when you, family rules. Normal societal rules. When you have a baby, it wasn't me, it was my wife, you ring the grandparents to say, "Hello, you've got a grandson, another grandson, another granddaughter." Of course you do. And they'd make sort of polite utterings on the phone and put the phone down.

As far as any interest in the children, there was none. I mean, I told them, they knew it. And I took both my children along to see them in Cambridge, I think twice over 30 years, [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1076s) certainly once. And they made all the right noises, but nothing more. I mean, the family's severed, the split is broken.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1086s)

Yeah, yeah, the relationship goes, doesn't it? It's a formality, there's no relationship.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1094s)

And I'm far fonder of my gardener, my housekeeper, and my local shopkeeper than I am of my family. They mean more to me than any of my nieces, nephews, and now dead parents and brothers because they threw me out and that was that. And it's really difficult to get emotionally involved when you're treated like that.

How did you cope with that as a 17-year-old? I got interested in lots of things, some I shouldn't have done. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1124s) know, girlfriends, going to the pub, going to the cinema, which had been banned. I felt very guilty doing it, but I was jolly well going to do it now.

And then I got a fairly high-powered job in Bristol, so that preoccupied me a lot and it distracted me from all the distress. Psychology is a wonderful thing. I kind of blanked it all off. It's painful and hurtful now to talk about it, but after this podcast is over, something [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1155s) switch off and I'll forget that half of that bit of my life existed. I'll be back to my current life. So there's a sort of protection mechanism that stops you going bonkers, because when I think about it and what they did and why they've done it, I get very, very angry. That's not healthy, that just eats me up inside, so I've got to stop that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1175s)

Well, I think that's quite an interesting point actually, because a lot of ex-members have been treated, yourself included, so abysmally, it's hard sometimes to manage that anger and hurt, isn't it?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1190s)

Yes, it is. And the self-righteous, priggish, "we're all correct and you're this evil sinner," it makes it even worse, of course, because they do impose upon you a sort of guilt, a mantle of guilt. It's all your fault and you're wrong. You've got your entire family telling you you're wrong, and everybody they know, and all the people you know socially telling you you're wrong. It's pretty tough to decide you're not [wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1220s). Arrogance or stupidity or lack of intelligence, I don't know, but I had to keep fighting this incessant barrage from everybody.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1229s)

Yeah, and I think that's actually quite an important message to anybody who is struggling with having left or who is inside and struggling. The ethos that comes out of the Brethren, if you're struggling, it's because you're not right with the Lord, or you know, you need to get clear or whatever they say. But actually, it's often, and I'm sure those who have left more recently can give testament to this, it's often the environment you're in that's perhaps [causing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1260s) the problem. And although leaving that environment is tough and very sad, how you feel once you're out of it is entirely different.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1268s)

Absolutely right. Yeah, there's a big weight off your shoulders. You can focus on different things, different priorities. I did, I focused on family and career and just had to put that aside. I just decided I was unfortunate enough to be born into an extraordinary mad system.

But had it carried on pre-1959 mode, who knows, I might still be there because there's nothing really wrong with that. It was just an evangelical, pleasant, happy community. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1298s) just went completely nuts when this eating separation business came in, and people got more and more fanatical, more and more cultish, more and more dug in, and ever more cruelties and awful things happening to people.

I remember in a meeting in Cambridge when the whole business of not going to university was on, one of the leading brothers looked at some young country graduates and said, "What college are you at in Cambridge?" He said, "Corpus Christi, Body of Christ, evil, you've got to go." "What college are you at?" "[I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1328s) Jesus, blasphemy, you've got to leave." And so on. Just because of the name of the colleges, these poor young people who worked all their life to get to Cambridge University were kicked out. Just astonishing. Just the name of the university. Clearly, I remember them saying Corpus Christi, that's evil, you can't call a college after the body of Christ, you must leave tomorrow. He did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1350s)

And he did.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1351s)

Yeah. Well, why do you think that is, that people just obey like that? I don't understand the psychology of cults, but that's what it is. I mean, why did the Nazis do what the Nazis did? Why did the SNP do what they do? Why does any groupthink group do it? It's because their peer group do it and they think they've got to behave the same way. And they convince themselves that's the ultimate and only truth, and all sorts of hell descends upon us when that happens.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1386s)

So to go back to when you actually sort of voiced that you didn't agree with not eating and drinking with people you wanted to eat and drink with, and you say your parents bought a caravan so that you had to live separately from the rest of the family, how long did that go on for?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1405s)

Three or four years. Oh God. And then I met my current wife in Cambridge and she had a flat, so I was able to get rid of the caravan and we got married shortly afterwards. About three or four years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1418s)

And in that three or four years, what was your relationship with your parents like? I mean, were you still allowed back into the house or would they... I'm just trying to sort of understand what it was like.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1432s)

I had to go back in to revise for my A-levels or something and I said, "I want to come in, in my bedroom are all my books and I can't carry them on my bicycle out to the caravan."

I wasn't allowed in, and lunch was served on the landing outside my door. So I revised for an hour or two, then somebody knocked on the door and said, "Your lunch is here," and they scuttled off downstairs. I picked up my lunch from the landing and ate it, and that was it. It was astonishing. As if they would spend eternity in hell opening the door and saying, "Hello Richard, here's your lunch."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1472s)

"Lunch is on the table, come and join us."

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1475s)

So just to clarify, if I remember rightly, the caravan initially was in the front of the house, that's right. And then someone suggested this was a compromise and you needed to be further away, which was when they towed it off at a safe five miles distance. Is that right?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1497s)

I've forgotten that, but you're absolutely right. Yeah, it was, I was still too close. I was on the premises, on the property in a caravan, and then some wise guy pointed out that a hardboard wall and a brick wall aren't really very different, so the caravan was towed away.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1514s)

How utterly, it's what's utterly astonishing, because we are all ex-members and we know how they think, but to anybody who has never heard of behavior like that, they would be absolutely jaw-dropped, wouldn't they, that you would do that to your teenage son.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1535s)

My friends up here in Aberdeenshire have asked me about my history, of course, my family history. I haven't had a mother or a brother or anybody else around apart from Richard. And so I tell them the story openly and honestly, and their jaws do drop and they say, "No, that can't be true."

And you see that particularly when they knew that my father was a brilliant Cambridge physicist with two PhDs, and Richard's father was a brilliant Cambridge physicist. Highly, highly intelligent people, are [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1565s) sort of numb skulls. Seriously intelligent people, right at the top of the intellectual scale, believe this complete nonsense and put it into action.

That was very difficult for me, that somebody so clever, so that I'm the sick one in the family, that my very clever older brothers and parents could actually believe this. So again, it makes you think, are you right? Have you got this right? Everybody you know and your super well-educated parents all are telling you something, and [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1597s) I just couldn't accept it. But you do go through heartaches and a lot of pain, a lot of misery.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1602s)

Yeah, and it must have taken considerable strength of mind because it would have been far easier just to have sort of keeled over and said, "Yeah, I accept I'm wrong, I'll just have to go along with it." But it must have taken considerable strength of mind at the time.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1616s)

Well, it was quite tough at times, yeah. But I just applied my logic to the situation and said, "This is not Christian, this is not right, this is going to affect the rest of my life. I'm only 18, 19, 20 years old. If I go along with this, I'm stuck in this nonsense forevermore. I can't do it." I owed it to myself not to accept it because I don't believe a word of it. And that helps, you know, that's what gave me the strength to break away and [find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1647s) my own way in life.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1647s)

And the other interesting point, obviously your children were not born in the Brethren, they didn't know the system, but they must have realized that they didn't have grandparents on one side of their family. How did they find it once they kind of understood the scenario?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1667s)

Yes, they were very upset by it all, wondering why they couldn't go to Cambridge and see all their cousins and second cousins and grandparents. I explained it to them, I suppose, when they were young teenagers, or perhaps earlier than that, especially through teenage years. And they came to accept that I had done absolutely the right thing and thanked me for not staying in so they weren't Brethren themselves.

You see, my daughter went on to become a urogynecologist, she'd never be able to do that in the Brethren. My son [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1697s) a brilliant degree in engineering computing science and uses that all the time. That annoys me or upsets me, I think, more than anything, is the bright young children. Mine are fine because I was out, but so many are trapped and limited in life, and their life is chopped off at the age of 16 or whatever it is.

And goodness knows what they've been taught at Brethren schools. I don't know whether creationism or something is taught these days. But it's, it should be, literally should be a law against this [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1727s) of young people. They should be allowed to go to university, and the fact families, a religious cult, bans them, I think some politician with some backbone should jolly well do something about that. It's absolutely wrong. I totally agree, there'll be a law against these children being banned from universities, absolutely black and white. And I actually spoke to my MP about it, but he doesn't want to get involved and he says religion is too difficult for me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1754s)

Yeah.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1755s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1755s)

That happened, you had that, didn't you Anne?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1758s)

So many of them say that and it's just so frustrating. "Oh, we can't get into that because of freedom of religion and all this." What about freedom of human spirit? And if God gave us an intellect, these Brethren people don't allow you to develop it. So it's an abuse of the scriptures right away. You're made as you are, you've got ability. You're saying about, there's something in the Bible about the [talents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1788s) or something.

It's absolutely wrong to curtail people at the age of 16 from any further education. Totally. It should be illegal. One of the things we can all do is keep repeating that and make it, hopefully, become illegal fairly soon.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1805s)

Yes, and the problem is, sometimes, it's a little bit devil's advocate, is the Brethren stance. I totally agree with you, Richard, by the way, about going to university. And not even going to university, it's the fact the Brethren children have no choice about their careers. There are some children that are not suited to university but would make superb plumbers. They're not even allowed to do that. You know, there is no choice about their careers.

The Brethren's argument to the university bit is that, "Well, our children choose not to go to university because they realize..." Yeah, right. Let's discuss that one for a little bit. Richard Jr., I see you laughing. But that would be their argument, wouldn't it?

Let's ask Richard Jr. because he could certainly have got a first-class honours doing anything he chose to do. I'm sure he could. Being denied that, Richard Jr.? 

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1853s)

PhD in stirring shit, probably.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1868s)

I think you've got that already, Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1873s)

Yeah, well the choice, I mean this is something that landed in the Brethren's lap almost by accident because they started off as a system that denied the idea of having ordained ministers or any kind of church official. So that nominally they're all on the level and they've got no titles.

Which they then found very advantageous because it meant that when they screwed up badly, they could always blame the individual and it didn't reflect on the system. I mean, if your church vicar does something wrong, then you can blame the church. But when it's just this flat system where everyone's nominally or legally just a participant, then it gives them this get-out-of-jail-free card. And they use that all the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1926s).

And of course, very notably, they say, "Oh, we don't break up families, it's entirely down to the family members if they want to continue contact with persons who've left." Now, what they don't say is that if the family chose to continue contact with the person that was left, then they in turn would be withdrawn from. So it's all dishonest and a lie.

But then of course, when the Charity Commission matter came up, they decided [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1956s) they would incorporate as a church, which then put quite a considerable legal onus on the trustees of the individual trust and on Bruce Hales as being officially the leader of the church. Which of course completely contravenes J.N.D.'s original idea about not having the notion of clergyman and all that.

But now it does mean that they are increasingly vulnerable to being sued as an organization and [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=1986s) to take responsibility for things as an organization. So a lot of this stuff is coming home to roost. But one of the things that's positive is that like in these podcasts, we now have so many witnesses, so many testimonies, so many affidavits, if you like, of the way they do break up families. Their argument is becoming untenable. It is really quite obvious that this is a centrally controlled, highly [centrally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2016s) controlled organization and that individual members in it do not have a choice as to whether or not they continue to have fellowship with persons who have left. So, slowly the perceptions are changing, and I think if a case came to court today, like ones that maybe came up 10, 20, 30 years ago, you would have a different outcome.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2040s)

Yeah, and I think too, it comes down to ultimately fighting, and I think it might take a few years for a change in the law in which, I mean in the UK we're fortunate enough to have the coercive control laws, but at the moment they only apply in a close personal relationship. And there is a strong movement to try and change that to incorporate that coercive control can happen from a group. Because [although](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2071s) it's a group, the behavior and the outcome is exactly the same as coercive control in a close relationship, but that hasn't yet happened legally, has it?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2083s)

No, I mean that would be a huge step forward, but things are moving in the right direction. I mean globally, there's less and less tolerance for the more extreme acts of bizarre religious groups. I mean the Jehovah's Witnesses lost a case in Belgium, wasn't it, whereby shunning was deemed to be, I don't know what the exact outcome was, but yes, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2113s) mean they were successfully sued, I believe, for their activity in shunning people. And then they lost government support in Norway over the same issue.

But the shunning that Jehovah's Witnesses do is exactly the same as the Brethren's withdrawing from, same thing. The Brethren are far more extreme, I would think, in general. So that's a precedent that must have had them shaking in their shoes. So yeah, there's a change in the tide, there's a long-term trend, particularly with the world becoming increasingly secular. There's just less tolerance for a lot of this nonsense.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2156s)

Yeah, there is. I think with the Jehovah's Witness case, it absolutely was that the ruling was that you can't condemn a group for having quirky rules and for saying if you don't abide by those rules, you can't be part of our group. So anybody's entitled to do that, but what they're not entitled to do is order everybody to cut you off because of that.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2183s)

Yeah, yeah, because there's no problem with the Brethren expelling people from the church, no problem at all. The problem is cutting them off from their families. I mean, people get expelled from churches all the time for good reasons or bad, but it doesn't mean that they can't come home and have a meal or sleep in the same bed. It doesn't mean they have to lose their job. Nothing wrong with excommunication, it's the rest of it that's the problem.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2213s)

Yeah, and I think that was the crux of the Jehovah's Witness ruling which, yes, would have the Brethren quaking in their shoes. And that it wasn't the expelling that was a problem, it was the aftermath of it. And I think that's probably how we would all feel.

For you, Richard Senior, the fact you didn't agree with a stupid rule they brought in was one thing, and if that meant you couldn't go to their church, so be it. But to lose your family in the way you did is just diabolical, isn't it?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2242s)

I think so, yes. But it's all interesting. I just asked Richard, "Richard, when you and your peer group realized you couldn't go to university, you're all very bright, did you resent that? Did you argue about it? Or did you just accept it meekly and think it was absolutely okay not to go to university?" What was your reaction when that happened?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2264s)

That was all history by the time I came along. So you were just sort of brought up where you didn't go to university. So the question never arose. I do know my oldest brother Robert, who was exceptionally, exceptionally bright.

He was doing his A-levels when he was 15 and they just couldn't keep his mind occupied. I know that my parents were called into the school and had quite an argument with the headmaster who was just insisting, much in the same terms as you would, that it was a terrible waste for this very talented young man not to go to university, because he obviously would have gone right to the top. I also know that...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2312s)

Sorry, did Robert mind that? I mean, did Robert react? Did Robert want to go to university?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2319s)

No, no, I don't think so. I mean, he was, in spite of being very intelligent, he was also very deeply indoctrinated. He never fought against it.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2329s)

Yes, yes.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2332s)

But my parents got into big trouble for having him do A-levels. I mean, Roy Norman, who you'll remember, who is also my uncle, he was very upset that Robert was doing A-levels.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2348s)

Roy Norman went to Cambridge for goodness sake. Well he did, yes. The hypocrisy is appalling.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2355s)

And when the edict came up, he literally took his degree and put it in the can and peed on it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2363s)

That's what they were urged to do.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2366s)

But I remember when I was a child, I was exploring in the attic of our house and there was an old earthenware jar right in the corner and it contained my parents' love letters, which I found very interesting, but also contained my father's university degree, which showed no signs of water stains. So, rather rebelliously concealed it up there, maybe in hopes the law would change.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2391s)

Yes, good. But I can remember, I can remember when I was at school, this is my whole argument about the university. When the Brethren say, I don't know how Ross and Anne you felt, but when the Brethren say, "Our children choose not to go to university," you could almost say yes, they do, but it is not even in our psyche, in our thinking, that that is an option.

I mean, I went through school and left at 16 and it wasn't even in my thinking [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2422s) that was an option. And it's a very weird thing to explain. Even had I been capable of it, well I did eventually in my 30s go to university, but had I even been capable of it, I don't know if you felt the same. Ann, you're a little bit younger, aren't you? But I don't know if you two felt it wasn't in your mindset.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2440s)

No, it wasn't. But interestingly, Natasha, my daughter, when she was living with me after I left, she said, well, they would watch documentaries with me on television. And she said to me one day on the way to school, she said, "I'd love to be a paramedic or join the army." And I said, "Well, you know, you can't do that if you stay where [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2470s) are." And she said, "Do you think they'd let me be a forklift driver?"

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2479s)

Yeah, and that's what I mean. It's not just the university, so it's a waste of exceptional talent that might be in there. It's the fact you can't even be a paramedic. I mean, my choice of career would have been to have been a nurse. I would have loved to have gone into nursing at 18 and done that. That was not even an option.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2497s)

Isn't the logical sequence of that, that when the Brethren need an orthopedic surgeon or an obstetrician or something, they shouldn't really go to them because they don't approve of the fact they've been educated to that level. If they don't get their own children, they should, I believe in more, if they never went to a doctor, never went to a surgeon in their lives. But of course, they'll be the first there, privately paid for.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2521s)

Absolutely. I think that's why you didn't stay in the Brethren, you're far too logical, Richard.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2528s)

I'm going to go off on a bit of a rant here. The Brethren say that the young ones going to university, it might lead them astray and they might leave the faith, but they don't think anything of splitting up families and chucking young kids out for doing basically, you know, well, stamping on a bible for instance, we've heard of people withdrawn from for that.

And then also, you know, they say, "Oh well, we get around it because we have [tertiary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2558s) study." Well, what they don't say is that all that tertiary study is things like business studies. It's not anything that could be used if somebody wanted to leave. It couldn't be used in the outside world, and it's not a choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2573s)

And it's not, no, there are certain courses they could do, but there's very limited choice. Yeah. It's interesting because if you have time on your hands and read through the full Charity Commission report when they had those issues, the Brethren's answer to the university education, which was one of the concerns the Charity Commission raised, was, "We would allow our young people to go to university should they wish, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2603s) they would have to leave the Brethren for the duration of the time they're at the university and they would of course be free to rejoin once they're finished." And it actually says, that's not the actual words, but it actually says words to that effect.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2621s)

It's just incredibly illogical, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2623s)

Sorry, I'm on a bit of a tangent there. But no, you're absolutely right. There's nothing logical about it. No. I think you're right. That's one of the arguments they use as well, is that our young people do do postgraduate education, they call it, but they don't really specify.

It would lead anybody in authority to believe it's fine, they allow their young teenagers to do post-18 education, I'm meaning, you know, sort of after school age, but without really specifying or looking at what it is they can do.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2669s)

And the other thing is, I think we've heard stories of people who have done this education and then they've left and they've shown the qualifications to people outside and basically they're not really worth the paper they're written on. They're not recognized grades, really.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2692s)

Recognized outside of the Brethren, so they're only useful if you're working for a Brethren business.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2698s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, the way I understand that they structure these courses, the courses are usually online and you pay for them. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. For example, I know that the AAT, which is the accounting technicians course, is something that's available to them. And if you've got your level four AAT, you are fully qualified to do accounts, but you can't sign them off. You need a chartered [accountant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2728s) to actually put a signature on them.

So the AAT would enable a lot of Brethren, if they'd got their level four, to draft accounts and then they'd have to get an accountant to rubber stamp them. But they have to, as I understand it, purchase the AAT through a Brethren company. I believe it's UBT, but Richard's nodding his head, I'm making sure I'm getting my facts correct here. And they purchase it off an external company. So they [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2758s) even sort of, oh, my daughter actually did the AAT and did it as an apprentice through the local college and it was a very good way for her to train, but they can't even do that. They still have to do that and buy it off the Brethren UBT company.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2774s)

With its markup, no doubt.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2776s)

With its markup, no doubt. Yes.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2780s)

No doubt.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2780s)

Yeah. So Richard, when you mentioned earlier, Richard Sr., you mentioned earlier about losing your two brothers. I know Richard lost his father. How did you find out ultimately that they'd passed away? Did you get a phone call from the Brethren or...?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2800s)

Richard, remind me how he found out. It was an...

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2804s)

Email from my brother Peter asking if he could, telling you that my father had passed and asking if you could let me know.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2817s)

That's right. And when I went back to ask what the funeral arrangements were and could I come down, there was a long, stony silence. And I discovered later that he'd long since been buried. He died and was buried within three days, allegedly, which I find extraordinary. And then I heard through the grapevine my other brother died a couple of months or a month or so later.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2841s)

They didn't contact you at all about that. I had an inside contact and I told you.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2845s)

That's right, that's right. The email dated December 4th, 2022 reads: "Uncle, the Lord took Father on Friday. He was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's and also had a water infection that had hospitalized him for a brief period. He was restful when he went. Mother is sustained. Please could you let my brother know. I tried to email him yesterday, but the emails bounced back. Peter Marsh."

The reply, December 4th is: "Peter, thank you for letting me know. I am very deeply saddened [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2880s) that, even though we could see it was clearly only a matter of time when we last saw him. Alzheimer's is the cruelest of afflictions, particularly for one who had a first-class brain. What are the funeral arrangements, please? I'm wondering what to do about that. Love to all, Uncle Richard."

December 4th, 2022 again: "Uncle, the burial was yesterday. Peter." Note, the email was sent the day after the burial.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2910s)

Presumably they've been buried in a Brethren graveyard as well.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2914s)

Yes, no doubt. There's graveyards around the meeting rooms, are there Richard, nowadays in Cambridge?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2920s)

Yes, that's right. Yeah, they have their own plot.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2925s)

Better not get into the discussion of graveyards.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2929s)

There was a rather poignant pause there, wasn't there? How long have we got? So do you feel, Richard Senior, that that was a deliberate ploy? They felt they had to tell you because that was the right thing to do, but their timing of telling you was very deliberate.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2952s)

So you know about it. They were determined I wasn't going to go to the funeral, so they told me afterwards. Yeah, because they were horrified when I turned up at my father's funeral, my mother's funeral. They all looked, well Richard, you were there, you looked at me as if I was some oddball from outer space, didn't you?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2967s)

You did rather stand out. I mean, I was, because I distinctly remember Aunt Pamela because she was wearing a hat, which was very, very odd to me because I was just used to headscarves. So, and you of course had a nice formal suit and tie on, and the Brethren again...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2992s)

Open neck shirt.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=2995s)

No ties. When did no ties come in anyway? The Brethren are in sort of semi-casual dress which they adopted as a uniform for no particular reason. So yes, I do remember seeing you there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3008s)

And where, to your parents' burials, did you go to the meeting or just the graveside? What at that point were you as an outsider allowed to go to?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3020s)

Just the graveside.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3025s)

Yes, yeah, but not the meeting service.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3029s)

Didn't really want to go to meetings. I think a lot of being there when the coffin came along to the cemetery.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3035s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then when Richard came into your life, how did it, I know we sort of touched on this before, but is it for you, I mean, you'd left, you were married, you had your family, you had your life and a very fulfilling and happy life it seems to be, but did it almost open up wounds for you in a way?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3060s)

It did two things. It certainly opened up wounds that there's so many people I hadn't seen or would never see or never know. And also, there was still a lingering guilt in my soul that I was wrong and they were all right. So it was very nice to have an ally who came out and said everything I thought. Because Richard, I think he will tell you that up until he exposed this awful company that was fiddling the NHS, Richard, I think, believed it all and was [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3091s) regular meeting-going member. And so to see his conversion, his non-conversion, was very good for my morale.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3102s)

Yeah, and it's interesting, isn't it? Because I think that lingering feeling, okay, I'm out, I left at quite a young age, married, had children, married another ex-Brethren actually, and had children and got on with our lives and that was past, that was then, that didn't matter. And probably, yeah, I was wrong to leave, but it's okay. And it takes a long time sometimes for that to go. I don't know how those, if you've left much more recently, Ann, than I did, [Richard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3133s) as well, but do you find the same?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3136s)

Sometimes, well for me, my past sort of catches up with me a little bit. People talk about moving on, and maybe it is like as a young person leaving, but when you've got children in there, no Richard, it's not about moving on. No, I mean, there is a way to learn to live with it. Yeah, but unless somebody does something, well for me it feels like I'm giving up on my kids if I don't do something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3168s)

Yeah, no, I get that totally. I don't know, how do you feel? Do you still feel, have that lingering, "Maybe I was wrong," because it takes, I just want to try to reassure people that are perhaps struggling with that or people who are in who overtly perhaps listen to these podcasts and are thinking, "Well, I must be wrong because actually I'm hearing some sense here and doubting it."

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3195s)

Yeah, I mean for me, it's the homosexual aspect really. I still think it's wrong to be who I am. Is that because that's what's been ingrained in you? And I hate myself for who I am quite a lot of the time. Yeah, because it's been ingrained into you for so many years. And it's just wrong.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3224s)

People are who they are, aren't they? They are who they are. So just seeing you, to sort of go back, if the Brethren, do you think, and this is a question I've often asked myself apropos my parents and my mother joining, do you think there could ever be anything that could happen that could encourage the Brethren to, and I don't want to say go back to how they were, because that's very unrealistic perhaps, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3258s) what do you think would perhaps encourage some sort of realization and change? Or do you think it's impossible?

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3266s)

I fear it might be impossible. But if somebody would expose Bruce Hales's money-making schemes, and there's a lot of sexual abuse of children I believe, and I think we've got, you know, somebody needs to point out the bad news. And somebody also needs to tell the younger people the world outside isn't evil and sinful, it's full of wonderful people and wonderful jobs and opportunities.

You've got to have a two or three-pronged attack. How you get that information into the heart of the system, I'm not sure. Hopefully they're looking at iPads and things [under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3296s) their blankets and can read. Well, we hope so.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3298s)

Which Richard Jr. is nodding.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3302s)

We mustn't go over the top because that actually, as I said earlier, I think a cult, if it's attacked, closes ranks and gets more fanatical. So we've got to sow doubt. We've got to go softly, softly catchy monkey here. So we point out the evils, we point out how good the world is outside. They never see a positive case for the world outside the Brethren. Nobody ever makes it to them, and they certainly don't make it, they make the reverse argument.

And it's going to be a long process. I mean, we're not going to, the Brethren aren't going to fall apart at the seams for another 20, 30, 40 years in my view. It will eventually. I mean, even, you know, come another couple of hundred years, I cannot believe there'll be a Brethren. And it's our job to start that splintering and disintegration now. But it's not going to be quick, it's going to take time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3351s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree. I mean, when you look at the length of time it's taken any entrenched regime to break down, look at apartheid for example, it took quite a few years for that, and there's probably some elements of it still there. But it takes quite a few years.

But what I do think is the strongest way to break it down is dissent from within it, or showing those within that out here isn't a [bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3381s) place. And also, a big testament to people who have left more recently than I have, like Anne and Ross and Richard, showing people that even though there's been huge heartache, actually you can still smile and you can still have a good life on a day-to-day basis. You don't forget that heartache and the kids and your mother, but you can have a good life.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3401s)

A much better life because you and your family can develop full potential, and that's important. And only by developing your full potential do you have any satisfaction in life. We've got to get in somehow into the young people in there, and Richard is more expert than I am on that. But when it does start to disintegrate, I think it'll fall apart very quickly. I actually think if we could start something going within [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3431s) Brethren, we would grow exponentially and we might just see it all falling apart quite soon. But I'll live in hope of that, it may not be the case.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3443s)

But I think in a sense, we all do. There's also the slight caveat that if it disintegrated, if the system disintegrated quickly overnight, I think there would be a lot of casualties, which would be tragic. As in, your parents and people that have invested their whole life, if they suddenly had to realize, I don't know if it'd be possible for some people, which is why I say that if almost [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3473s) could allow people to say to people, "It's actually okay to go to meetings and to break bread in your way and to keep morally, not physically, separate from evil because that's what you claim you do, but you can still see your family that are not in the Brethren." You know, it is okay to start behaving like a mainstream church...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3497s)

If enough could start to do thatiIt would start to fall apart, what it is now, it would fall apart then, wouldn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3502s)

Yeah, it would start to fall apart because I think the control would go, wouldn't it? But that's almost what you want to happen, but slowly, slowly, because you don't want people to suddenly realize that 70 years of their life has been invested in something and they don't know what to do.

Well, Richard Senior, thank you very much. It's been very, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3532s) interesting talking to you. And for me, what's been, and I think for others, and I hope for our listeners and those inside too, what has been most interesting is perhaps the transition you saw in the late 50s, early 60s that led to your expulsion from the Brethren, and how you could see that was going there. I don't think you were the only one at that point.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3553s)

No, no, I think I was the only one in Cambridge as far as I remember. So it was, yeah. But it's the best, and I have to tell you, forgive me, it's the best thing I ever did. I mean, as I grew older and had a career and had a family, I just realized what, how life would have been so limited, so stunted, if I stayed there. And then Richard appearing in my life was a great joy. So yes, I don't regret a minute of it, but I'm very [angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3584s) and upset by the behavior of the Brethren. I think it's not Christian.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3588s)

No, yeah, totally not Christian. Yeah. Richard Jr., your uncle's very pleased to have you in his life?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3597s)

Well, that goes both ways. I mean, when he was talking about how, when we met, it helped him to face up to those lingering doubts, of course, very much more so for me, because having left the Brethren, I was kind of paralyzed as to how I was going to make my way in the world.

And you know, having that father figure there and, you know, practical lived experience of how to go from being dumped in a caravan at 17 to being very successful was very inspiring. So I haven't risen to the same height, but yes, I've made my way. I'm comfortable, I'm happy, and it's hugely important for anyone that's leaving. You need a mentor, you need a friend, you need a mentor, and I was very lucky to have that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3685s)

Out of interest, Richard Jr., why did you not contact your uncle Richard?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3691s)

That is a good question. It wasn't actually that I thought he would reject me. It was that deeply ingrained inhibition because you're taught that people who've gone out are especially evil. In the Brethren kind of hierarchy of humanity, there's the Brethren at the top, and then there's worldly Christians who there's something good about them, [maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3721s), and then there's ordinary people who are just dirty. But then there's the people who've left the Brethren, a particular kind of evil.

And I don't think it was that I consciously thought that, it was just an inhibition. Just like when you first go to the cinema, you get that awful guilty feeling. Or when you first eat a meal with non-Brethren, you get that guilty feeling. There was just something, I just wasn't ready to take that jump. And it was just [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3751s) inhibition. So, you know, I apologize, uncle, for my doubts.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3758s)

I appreciate that. It was just the way we thought, wasn't it? The left were much more evil than the person in the street.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3767s)

I mean, if you're brought up a Muslim and believe that it was a terrible sin to eat pork and then you convert to a Christian, the first time you eat a piece of bacon, you're still going to feel bad because it's just kind of instinctual.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3780s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's interesting. And he didn't end up being bad at all, did he, Richard Jr.?

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3787s)

He's a little, a little dubious, but...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3791s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3792s)

Yeah, yeah. But I think you're right, there's probably, he was this uncle who you never knew. Because I had an uncle who I never knew who had left before I was born, and they were kind of a shadowy, I don't know quite, it's very difficult to explain, isn't it? They were a sort of a shadowy...

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3816s)

The family ghost, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3820s)

Yes, that's a good way to put it, the family ghost.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3823s)

I can fully relate to that because it took me a long time to see my cousins. Yeah, because I thought, you know, like yourselves, well, it was their dad that left. So again, it was like, "Oh, he's bad, you know, I can't be in touch with them because we left," sort of thing. It took me probably four or five years to get in touch with them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3851s)

And I bet when you did, they were quite pleased to hear from you.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3854s)

Yeah, they were.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3855s)

Really pleased. Yeah. And I think the last thing I'd want to say is I think in a way, the story of Richard Senior leaving and making his life and just kind of having to forget about the immediate family he left behind, and then suddenly having a member of that family come into his life, should give everybody hope. I really do. I bet you never thought you would have that close a relative to you, Richard, until Richard Jr. came [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3885s). You had an immediate family and your wife's family, but...

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3888s)

It was wonderful. That's probably the best thing that ever happened.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3895s)

Yeah, yeah. So I think that should give others hope. You just never know. You just never know what's going on and what might happen and when you might suddenly find you've got a family member you did know you have and would love to have back in your life. Absolutely.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3913s)

They mightn't reach out straight away.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3915s)

No, no, give them time.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3918s)

Give them time. I suppose, don't push it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3921s)

Yeah, it's got to be on their time, hasn't it? Which we totally understand. I think we all understand that, don't we, as ex-members.

### [**Richard Marsh Jr.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3929s)

Thawing process. Put them in the microwave.  Five minutes at low power.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3935s)

But yeah, no, I wanted to say, Richard Senior, thank you very much, because I do think the story you've told, I don't think a lot has changed. I'm not sure they quite buy caravans now. I think what they do with errant teenagers is put them in an empty house that's owned by some brother who hasn't yet married. Isn't that what they do? So they've upgraded from caravans now, but the principle is just the same. You're errant, you know, you're not agreeing, so [essentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3965s) their behavior, I don't think, has changed in all those years, just the various aspects of it.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3971s)

No, I was unfortunate to get right at the start of it, so of course it's affected my entire life from a teenager onwards.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3977s)

Yeah, but it's also good to know that you have had a very fulfilling life because you managed to get out so young and have time ahead of you to be able to do those things.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=3987s)

That's why I'm so angry for all the other young people. And for young people that are thinking of leaving, if they're listening to this, it is important to maybe get an education if that's what you want to do. There's many that come out and go off the rails because they don't go and seek out a job. So it is important to try and get some structure in your life early on. And [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4018s) any young Brethren are listening to this, they're very welcome to talk to me and I'll tell them about life outside and all the positives.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4023s)

And how good it is. Yeah. And on the score of education, you don't have to be young to get it. I mean, I went back to university at the grand old age of 33\. And the story behind that was, I mentioned that I would quite like to have been a nurse and it wasn't an option, but I was allowed to get a job as a dental nurse. And as a dental nurse at the age of 16, you didn't have to qualify, but there was an option to do an exam and be a qualified dental [nurse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4053s).

And it was an evening class that you did around your full-time job. And I can remember quite clearly, it was free because I was under 18, and I can remember quite clearly saying to my mother, "Well, I can't do that, it's evenings, I'll miss the Monday night prayer meeting." And my mother's reply was, "Blow the prayer meeting, you're doing that." If she hadn't done that, I would not have been able to go on and qualify subsequently. So yeah, I'll just say that by way of, to say to young [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4083s), you know, it's never too late. You've got to want to do it and there are usually avenues. But yes, my mother was a bit of a rebel.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4092s)

Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4092s)

Yeah. Richard, thank you very much for your time and for sharing your story with us and for joining us on the podcast. And I look forward to keeping in touch.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxPbN6IWH30&t=4104s)

Yes. Yeah. I like seeing the emails that go back and forwards between you all. And yes, thank you very much. Thank you. Keep up the great work. It's a crusade. We must not give up. We must keep at it. Yeah. Yeah, we will. Thank you. Good for you, Jacky. Thank you. Goodbye, nephew. Goodbye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
