### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3Da4Nl3ftLStU%26t%3D22s)

Yes. This. Thank you. That's like a normal Christian church. Like, it's okay if you stop going to the same church as someone. They'll still talk to you.

Yeah, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, they claim to be a mainstream Christian church. No.

Mainstream Christian churches do not shun people. They do not kick people out simply because they chose to stop going to said church.

It's ridiculous thank you for this comment because yes you apparently go to a normal church not a cult congratulations seriously oh yeah the PBCC is sad and messed up.

Hey everybody, so for my PBCC video today I am going to talk about the PBCC and politics. I don't know if you guys are aware, but here in the United States there's a presidential election going on. I know you might have missed it. It's easy to miss.

The Brethren, they are not allowed to vote.

I'm not really sure why. I'm sure they have some scriptural reference, but I never really was that good at paying attention to that stuff. So I'm not really sure why they can't vote, but they're not allowed to vote. Not in local, state, national, any sort of elections. Nope, not allowed.

However, don't let that fool you into thinking they don't care about politics.

Have I mentioned they have a lot of money?

Yeah. And money is super important to them?

Yeah. They like to throw it at campaigns.

As well, we often had to have special prayer meetings to pray that certain laws wouldn't take effect or would, depending on. To pray that certain candidates got in or didn't depending on.

I can remember like I was a teenager I don't remember which election it was but like I remember it being recommended that in Minnesota which is where I am from we make phone calls like cold calls to people asking them to vote for a certain like senate candidate and my older sister did it I was like absolutely not I will not be doing that thank you very much can you imagine what do you say like so you're talking to someone saying like you really need to vote [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=188s) so and so and they're like oh is that who you're voting for no I'm not allowed to vote because the call time in won't let me.

I don't remember that being part of the script but you know in my mind that's what probably would have happened and it would have been really awkward. So yeah. Now I think they just spend a lot of money throwing it at campaigns but doing shady ways around it. Shady things. I don't know what I'm saying but you know what I'm saying.

Everything's shady with them.

Yeah so currently this time around they are throwing their support behind Donald Trump but don't let that fool you. That has not been the case every time. I don't remember in 2020 who they went for, but in 2016, it was very much not Donald Trump. They did not like him.

It was actually recommended, like, to try and drum up support for Hillary Clinton instead.

So, you know, another one of those things the Lord probably turned a corner on for them.

Weird how that only happens for them, right?

Yeah, so no voting allowed.

But they'll still be involved. So there you go. PBCC and politics.

So for today's video, I'm going to talk about the PBCC and their huge Sunday meals. So if you've been following me for a while, I did a video a while ago on their Sundays, which are intense, to say the least. I mean, these are the people that go to meeting every single day of the week. So Sunday, they're going to take it to the next level. It's great.

Three to four, sometimes five meetings a day. No problem. But on Sunday, at their big main meeting, you would have like multiple localities of brethren would attend one meeting. So like where I was, that was like five or 600 people would be present and so you weren't allowed to eat out like at restaurants or something food made by unclean hands are you crazy can't be doing that [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=322s) that meant that whatever locality was quote unquote hosting the meeting the people that lived there had a lot of people to entertain.

So, like, my dad and mom when I was younger had a table that seated like 16, I think, and we were a family of six, which meant we could have like 10 guests, maybe 12 if like a couple of us kids sat in the kitchen.

Well that wasn't enough. So then we started eating buffet style, which meant everyone sat in the living room and women passed the food around and then grabbed a plate in the kitchen, scurried around, passed it around again so everybody could have seconds. And we were talking like 22 guests, give or take. Well then the cool thing became the Amish dining room tables. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, let me explain. The Amish tables are like beautiful wood tables with 89 million. okay I might be exaggerating a little, leaves. So when it was [small,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=390s) it was very small, like just maybe six feet across, but you could extend that sucker out to be like 30 feet long.

You think I'm kidding and I'm not. Someday I'm going to find a picture of one.

Yeah, so my parents got their hands on one of those.

So the plus was at least then we could all sit down and eat the meal together like you might still be on an uncomfortable chair but at least you could sit down but the amount of work that went into these meals was huge like you couldn't just feed these people a hot dish no no no no this needed to be like a full like turkey mashed potatoes stuffing multiple vegetables salads rolls, dessert.

Yeah.

Yep. Lots of work. Yeah. And of course, alcohol. Can't forget that. The women did all of it. The men, well, they served the alcohol, I guess.

And oh and they said grace yeah they blessed the food.

And yeah I think that's all that oh they greeted the company when they arrived at your house told them to come in.

I don't think I missed anything yeah we cleaned we cooked we cooked some more we served the food, we cleared the table, we did the dishes.

Yeah, Sundays were a real hoot.

Zero stars.

Nope.

Anyway, there you go. Sundays.

Fun day\!

Hey everybody, so today for my PBCC video, I don't know it's so much as a fact as it's more of a I'm just sharing some stories kind of trying to give you guys some insight into the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

So I've talked a little bit about from the time I was eight until I was almost 12 my parents were in trouble with the cult and so they were kicked out. And me and my siblings were sent to live with other Brethren members because, quote, the only right place for us is with the Brethren.

Not so much. That's another story.

But I was recently reminded of something that happened. And it was towards the end of this time period, actually. So it was the spring of 1998, and it sticks very strongly in my head.

So my brother, who was eight years older than me, so he would have been, what, about 19 at the time, give or take? and another brethren guy about the same age as him did something extremely wicked.

They decided to attend a graduation party for a couple worldly girls. I know, can you imagine?

Ugh, terrible.

But to the brethren it was. It was literally a huge deal.

So this happened on a Sunday afternoon evening, because that's when this party was.

And of course, I was still young, living with my uncle and aunt, which also happened to be where my brother was living too.

And it was a huge deal and I remember all day that Monday there was like priestly visits with my brother, like the priests, the local priests came over and talked to him and like it was this huge deal and there was talk that he might get kicked out he might be confined at the very least. And for me, who at that point was 11 years old, it was unthinkable. I was so scared for him. Like, can you imagine being kicked out of the Brethren?

And I can remember that Monday night. It was like a local little meeting night, which someday I'll do a video on all their different meetings because that's a whole other topic. But anyway, the meeting room was just down the street, like maybe two blocks. And I can remember walking to meeting by myself and, and, because it was a, you know, late May night and I was just so upset about this. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=705s) my brother wasn't allowed to go to meeting that night.

And on my way home, I can see it so clearly. I was walking down the sidewalk and I was just bawling my eyes out.

I felt so alone because I didn't have my parents. My two other siblings didn't live with us. They were staying at other brethren's homes. I didn't have my brother to talk to because I couldn't talk him because he was in trouble and all I could imagine was I'm losing my brother.

It was terrifying and it's something I really struggle with now like I have been out of the Brethren for 17 years and it's the one thing that makes me super sad and obviously a little bit emotional is I just remember how terrified I was at the thought of him being out of the Brethren [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=775s) I feel terrible imagining that this is what my family thinks of me they're genuinely scared for me because they are that brainwashed like they they genuinely when they believe that I have lost my way. I am not saved. I'm going to hell. I'm evil.

And that makes me sad for them because they're so misled.

I have to remind myself that I'm doing what I know is right for me.

But I also hate knowing how much pain it causes my family.

And it's, if I'm being honest, one of the reasons why I kind of took a break from doing these videos for a while is because I know that the more I do these videos and word gets back to my family, I'm hurting them. Because to them I'm doing the most wicked thing of all. and that is talking against the brethren.

But I have to hope that some time, some way, something I say is going to sink in.

I have to hope that because if I lose that hope, then I've lost everything.

I worry a lot about my parents. I know especially my mom her health isn't 100% and I'm scared that I'm contributing to some of this.

It's hard and I miss them so much.

Anyway, that's what I got for today.

Okay, so you're thinking you should maybe leave.

You're in this religious cult and you're thinking, hmm, I don't know. I think I want to leave. What do you need to know?

Where do I start? And honestly, this is a really hard question to answer because I think it's really different for everyone.

So I will just say a couple little things and then I'll say, please send me a message, comment on one of my posts, something.

I'm more than happy to talk more.

But the first thing I'll tell you is in the Brethren, they will constantly tell you that people that leave are choosing an easier way. That's why they want to leave. They're just choosing an easier way.

Well, I'm here to tell you that could not be more of a lie. It would be so much easier to just stay in the brethren, following blindly along, doing what you're told, living where you're told to live, marrying who you're told you can marry, yeah you have a job, make lots of money because they pay other brethren lots of money you don't have to make any decisions you're just told what to do, easy peasy yeah. Leaving the brethren? [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1000s)

I think it's something that has caused a lot of people to struggle when they leave. And it's caused some to go back and forth. And it's because they don't have a plan. And they don't realize that when you leave the Brethren and you lose your family, your home, your job, your friends, everything.

You and only you are responsible for yourself.

Yes, there might be people who are there to help you along the way, but you can't rely on that, because at the end of the day, we're all just doing the best we can. And when you leave the brethren, you're in charge of figuring out your livelihood, your home, all of these things. No one's gonna tell you what to do.

You have to have a plan and figure it out.

So that is kind of a big learning curve, I think, for people that leave the brethren.

I've definitely heard from a number, you know, I've learned to be a little bit discerning in accepting messages from people because I want to help anyone that wants to leave the brethren. But with that said, you have to understand that you have to help yourself too.

And that's, that's complicated. And if you just want to leave the brethren because you're annoyed with some little thing, like you can't go to the movies, just hang in there. The Lord will probably turn a corner again and you'll be able to do that soon.

I'm sorry, that sounded a little cynical, didn't it? But really, if you're serious, if you genuinely have a problem with the brainwashing, the covering up of abuse, the shunning of people that choose to go to a different church, if you seriously want to get away from that, then you should leave, make a plan, figure out what you're going to do financially, [figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1131s) out where you're going to live. All these things are things you really do need to think about. But along with the practical side of things like that is, and I don't know if there's a way to mentally prepare yourself, but try and think about what it's going to be like.

When you can't just hang out with your friends, your family, you're the last person to know that a loved one is going through a medical treatment.

It's harder than you'd think. And you tell yourself, oh, I can handle it.

But in the moment, it's hard. And I remind myself constantly when I'm in that situation, this is the price I'm paying for stepping away. It's not right.

Just because I choose to go to a different church doesn't mean that I should be the last person to know that my mom is undergoing an open heart surgery. But it's the way it is. And you have to prepare yourself for that.

So those are just a couple things to really think hard about. Make sure that you are mentally strong enough, that you are physically strong enough, and plan and think. And something else, you're taught that worldly people are pretty much all bad. And there are some bad worldly people. You do have to be very careful who you trust. But there are so many very, very, very, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1236s) good people.

And then there's those of us wicked ones that have left. Don't be afraid to reach out to us. We're actually not quite as evil as they probably made us sound. So feel free to reach out. I'm happy to talk.

So quick follow up to yesterday's video about so you're thinking of leaving the religious cult. So over the years, I've had a handful of people ask me, do you have any regrets about leaving? Have you ever considered going back? And I can say with 100% certainty that no, I have not one time ever considered going back. I can't even imagine a situation where I would ever consider such a [thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1284s) Especially not after having had the freedom to think for myself and make my own decisions.

No.

As for regrets, no. I don't regret leaving. I've never regretted leaving. I regret that I was so naive. I genuinely didn't understand the depths of the distance that would be put between me and my family because of me leaving.

But I don't know if I can even call that a regret because it really isn't something I could have changed.

I couldn't have seen that coming. And I just have to live with it. It is what it is. And I have to accept that this is the price I pay for freedom from the cult. freedom from being brainwashed, told what to do, where to live, how to think, who to marry.

Yeah.

And as much as it hurts, because it does, I miss my family so, so much.

But I have said a thousand times that I have gained so, so much more.

I have so many true real relationships and friendships that I would never have experienced and then to me the very biggest thing of all is my faith.

I don't think that in the Brethren I really understood having a relationship with Jesus And it's funny because it's a religious cult. Like you would think that that would be the key part, but it's not. I have a much deeper faith than I ever did when I was in the Brethren. And to me, that's worth everything.

So, no. Zero regrets.

Good morning. So for today's PBCC video, I'm going to do a little dive into the Plymouth Brethren's website. Yeah. Yeah.

PlymouthBrethrenChristianChurch.org.

So nice.

So accurate.

Every time I look at it, it kind of makes me want to throw up in my mouth a little bit, but just for you guys, I'm delving into it again.

Now, for those of you that have been around a while, are familiar with the brethren you're probably saying hmm I remember when like computers were evil technology was terrible they couldn't have radios tvs computers cell phones you name it technology was just generally bad well you must have missed it, the lord turned a corner.

You know the way he does.

Yeah “the Lord turning a corner” is basically code for brethren leadership need to change the rules to make it easier for their businesses or something and so they just tell the nice good members that the Lord turned a corner so now they can do those things so convenient the way that works anyway.

Anyway, under their frequently asked questions, they have a few gems. You know, my favorite is, are the Plymouth Brethren a cult?

Now, in my personal opinion, if you have to list that as one of your frequently asked questions, you're probably a cult.

Just thinking. But for today, I'm going to focus on another one. Do the Plymouth Brethren break up families?

No. I will read you exactly what their website says. 

“The incidence of marriage breakup amongst the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is fortunately very rare and well below societal norms. Any breakdown of relationships within a family is always tragic, and every effort is expended to prevent this occurring or to try and bring in reconciliation if it does.”

Oh, isn't that nice? Yeah, of course marriage breakup is unlikely. You're not allowed to get divorced. Sorry, turns out that your husband is an abusive jerk? Too bad, you're married to him. You only met him like three times before you got married? Too bad. You're stuck with him.

Best of luck to you.

Oh, turns out your husband was like someone that sexually abused children? Well, you better just live with that. The brethren forgave him. You should too. It's fine. Everything's fine.

As for the breakdown of relationships within a family, It's always tragic and every effort is expended to prevent this. Really? Is it? Because, you know, some of us that have left would go out on a limb and say, it doesn't really feel like you're expending that much effort at all.

In fact, you, like, actively try and avoid interacting with us. So, yeah. Yeah, every effort might include like, you know, actually talking to us. But what do I know?

Anyway, I've got so much more to share about the Plymouth Brethren website. It is a thing of beauty.

So today I decided I should continue my deep dive into the delight that is the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church website. I'm not sure why I'm calling it a deep dive because I didn't have to dive very deep at all for this one. It's literally right at the top of their homepage. The very first thing there's like a slideshow of four and they're just such charming points representing what warm and caring people [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1681s) are.

The first one says, 

“We endeavor to live in the generous and caring spirit of Christ our Savior.”

Yes, we don't kick people out for not agreeing with us and never talk to them again. 

“We care.”

We don't support people that have been abused in our church. We support their abusers, but we care. Isn't that nice? I thought it was nice. Yeah. And then let me just go to the next one here.

“Through our faith, we are inspired to be good and caring neighbors.”

I don't really know what to say about that one because like, you're not really that neighborly.

Like I always laugh when I hear people say, oh no, they've been really good neighbors. like they helped when there was a flood going on they helped fight the flood mm \-hmm yeah because like it didn't save their businesses or homes oh wait kind of did yeah if you actually look at the things they support and the things they do they're always getting a benefit too.

It's not a totally selfless thing ever, but it looks good on the website, doesn't it? Okay, next. Number three of four. Oh, this is my favorite one. 

“Family is at the heart of everything we believe and everything we do.”

That one really really just got me in the feels you know.

Yeah I'm kind of calling bull on that one because like it's at the heart of everything we believe in everything we do right up until a member of our family like leaves, then “Bye.”

Yeah so then final one, four of four;

“ For everyone whosoever who shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

That one I have zero problem with ,actually like very good point. I mean they also believe that they're saved to a higher level than everyone else but I mean at least the rest of us have a shot.

 I mean except for me because I had the privilege of being brethren and chose to leave, so doubtful if there's much hope for me, but [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=1852s) hypocrisy knows no bounds.

I'm sure I'll find more to discuss about their website tomorrow. Can't wait.

Hey everybody, so today for my PBCC video I decided I'd dive back into my favorite website, PlymouthBretherenChristianChurch.org. By the way, I did double check because I had mentioned that they have another website called TogetherWeAre Brethren. That one doesn't seem to have as much information, but I did chuckle a little bit because it references that the reason they created this website was, although they're believers in the Holy Bible, unlike other believers, they're very misunderstood.

Aw, did someone's feelers get a little hurt? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'll stop now and pretend to be mature for one second. And anyway, in my favorite section, you know, the frequently asked questions, you know, that area that starts with

“Are the PBCC a cult?”

I'm going to just let you guys determine that for yourself.

Just come to your own conclusions.

Yeah.

So, the question I am going to go to today is a really good one that I've wanted to know the answer to for a long time.

It goes something like this. Oh shoot, now my tablet just locked up. Okay, hold please, I'm not that tech-savvy. I grew up in a cult, remember?

“Are there specific rules that the PBCC must follow?”

Are there?

Sorry, I'll get to the answer now.

“There are no specific rules.”

You heard it here first, people.

“Brethren universally maintain beliefs and a lifestyle that is based on the Holy Scriptures, and we are genuine in our endeavors to secure a sustainable structure of family life for the enduring happiness of our members, however diverse in character, capacity, and cultural diversity.”

That was a lot of words.

But I'm going to start with that first sentence.

There are no specific rules. Wow\!

I had no idea. Yeah, so then why did I have to wear a scarf all the time or a token?

And I couldn't cut my hair or color it or wear makeup or jewelry? Couldn't wear sleeveless shirts or tank tops to meeting?

I had to wear skirts or dresses, couldn't wear pants. Had to wear pantyhose to meeting because, you know, protecting my modesty.

I think that's phenomenal news.

I mean, I guess now they can just live where they want to live, work for who they want to work for, marry who they want to marry, if they want to go to college and become doctors, lawyers.

No problem. They can vote. There are no specific roles.

For any of you PBCC members that are watching this, like, it's right on your website. I mean, just send me a message if you want a link to it, but it shouldn't be hard to find because it's right on your website. There are no specific rules.

So you do you, okay?

The next and final sentence, because yes, that last one is a long one.

I kind of read through this and tried to unpack exactly what all those words meant.

And I finally decided that we are genuine in our endeavors to secure a sustainable structure of family life for the enduring happiness of our members, that must be where they, you know, cover up, like, abusive children and spouses and things, and you just shut your mouth and deal with it. That must contribute to the enduring happiness, right?

Asking for a friend.

Anyways, and then there's the “however diverse in character capacity and cultural diversity” yeah because the brethren have always been known for their diversity.

I'm like, character capacity and cultural diversity, so however diverse they are in character is that like basically saying if you're not that great of a person it's okay as long as you’re brethren, and we got you? Capacity is that like the size of your family, your physical size, size of your bank account? I'm leaning towards that one.

Cultural diversity yeah yeah no no that's not really ever been their thing. So as near as I can tell this paragraph was kind of an amazing mishmash of words by some seriously talented publicist.

And what I'm thinking probably happened is the question was, are there specific rules that the PBCC must follow? And the answer was probably there are all the rules, all of them. And the publicist was like no no no no no we can't put that out there are you kidding and so they came up with there are no specific rules.

It looks good on the website I think but anyway now you guys know and me too, no rules so you guys they could be talking to me there's no rule against it  \- so maybe it's just that they don't like me.

Oh, what a shame.

Okay, see you tomorrow.

Hey everybody, so for today's PBCC video, I thought I might as well continue on this wild ride. Checking out the PBCC website, I mean it's been a hoot so far.

I've got my tablet ready to go. It's unlocked today and everything. It's a big day.

Okay, so today's frequently asked question.

“ What is the PBCC lifestyle actually like?”

Wow\! I mean I don't know why they didn't ask my input. I could totally have nailed this one but let me share;

“Brethren universally maintain beliefs and a lifestyle that is based on the holy scriptures and we are genuine in our endeavors to secure a sustainable structured family life for the…”

Wait a minute this sounds a lot like the last one I did. You don't you don't think they copied and pasted? I’ll keep reading;

“...to secure a sustainable structured family life for the enduring happiness of our members however diverse in character capacity and cultural diversity.”

 [Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=2348s) that's pretty much the identical answer yep.

Word for word to the one I covered yesterday?

Are there specific rules that the PBCC must follow? They literally put the same answer.

So the PBCC lifestyle, it's about, if you want to know what it's actually like, apparently this is the answer. The Brethren universally maintain beliefs in a lifestyle that is based on the Holy Scriptures, and their genuine in their endeavors to secure a sustainable structure of family life, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 

Yeah, no, you know what it's actually like? It's actually like you're told what to do and what to think and where to live and where to work, where to send your children to school and who you can marry and what you can wear. Did I say that one already? I probably did.

Yeah, and if you're a woman, you're never, no matter what, going to be as important as a man. So, good try, but you will be in the back of the meeting room because you're not as important.

That's a little more accurate.

It's a little blurb. They really, I wonder how many other places they used it. Huh.

Maybe that publicist shouldn't have gotten paid so much.

Can't believe they do something like that.

Anyway, you want to actually know more about their lifestyle? Well, send me a message. Ask me a question. Don't go to this nonsensical website.

Because you'll read about the happiness of their members, however diverse they are in character capacity and cultural diversity.

Blah, blah, blah.

Right, there you have it. Hey, everybody. So today's video on the PBCC, I am going to talk about their housing rules. So I have no idea why their rules are what they are. And I'm sure they've probably changed over the years. They've probably even changed since I left, but this is the way it was when I left.

For some reason, mobile homes, trailer homes, those are bad. but manufactured homes okay like a prefab no problem apartments and townhomes bad can't be sharing walls with worldly people I guess the contamination can maybe just flow through the walls or the floors or something makes total sense.

So it needs to be a freestanding home. Now one thing that I know for sure has changed is so at my dad and mom's house they had a garage that was not attached to their house.

There was just a sidewalk between the house and garage very narrow area and it was actually covered by this little roof I mean it would have taken nothing to connect them and I remember saying to my dad like why don't we just like build a breezeway like wouldn't it be so nice to just duck from the house to the garage without having to go out in a 40 below weather in January.

And no we couldn't do that because back in the day Mr. Symington, who would have been Jim Symington one of their leaders, he died like the year after I was born so I don't really remember him but what he said still went but he had had a problem with attached garages apparently they were bad.

So like 20 years later yeah my dad still wouldn't attach his garage because Mr Symington said it was wicked. So that must have been one of those things that the Lord turned a corner on too because now they all seem to have attached garages like it's no big deal at all. I mean, how can you really have a giant mansion without an attached garage? I mean, that would be just weird, right?

Whatever.

Anyways, also, you know, there's different people, especially in small towns, I've had say to me like, oh, I'm trying to sell my house. Like, what can I do to make it more appealing to Brethren? Dining room, dining room, dining room, dining room, dining room, must have a giant dining room.

That's it. That's really the most important thing. Although again, anymore, they pretty much are going to gut it and do a giant addition anyways. So whatever. I would just put it up for sale and see what happens. I mean, yeah who knows also another little tidbit about the living arrangements that I forgot to mention when I was talking about if you're confined so say you still live at home with your parents you've been a naughty young girl and you have been confined.

Your parents might not be confined or your other siblings might not be confined so then you can like live in the basement but you can't eat with them because they haven't been confined but you have. 

This also goes for like say a family where the husband did something, maybe he got a DUI maybe he broke some who knows what kind of rule yeah, so of course they're not going to [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=2730s) separated but he can't keep living with his family, so then he's going to live in the basement.

 He's on his own for like meals and things but the wife and kids can still go to meeting and still live in the house with him.

So they can still share a roof and walls, but yeah, it's confusing.

Anyway, there you have it. Little tidbit on their housing. 

Hey, everybody. So today for my PBCC video, I thought I'd just quickly talk about something, I don't know, that I kind of think is cool. So obviously I've been out of the Brethren for quite a few years and I sometimes wonder is there ever gonna come a day when I don't like feel kind of a a joy, a thrill, when I'm doing something that if I was still Brethren I wouldn't be able to do.

I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever feel that. And it can be the simplest thing. You know, listening to a different song on the radio, watching a different TV show. This weekend it was going to a farmer's market out of town that it occurs during their meeting time. So they would never be able to make it to this particular farmer's market.

And I mean it might be traveling somewhere different it might be going camping there's a million little things and they're just boring day-to-day life things but yet they're special because we have that option. And I was thinking about it more because obviously [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=2854s) I was digging around in their website and found that very special little note about “There are no specific rules”. I would say I have no words but by now you guys know me, I always have words.

It's such a bunch of nonsense. There are so many little rules for so many things. Everything has a rule.

And so I am sure I am not the only ex-brethren that feels this way. That like right now, for example, I'm at a work conference. I'm staying overnight in a place where there are no brethren, thankfully.

And it's so cool. It's like, this is wild.

Not a big deal, but yet it's the biggest deal.

Yeah.

Anyway just a simple little thought we do appreciate the life we get to live now I think.

And this is why I could never in a million years go back to it because you're giving up the freedom to just enjoy living.

Just enjoy life.

Anyway, that's all I got for you tonight. 

Good morning, friends. I thought I would quickly do my PBCC video. I am at conference this week, and like I could live with this view in the background.

I mean, but then would I enjoy it this much when I got to come and visit?

Probably.

Anyway, so today for my PBCC video, I thought I'd talk a little bit about women in the Brethren. So I think I've touched on it before. there's no question women are not as important as men there's just, it's just the simple facts.

Right on my favorite website the PlymouthBrethrenChristianChurch.org under their frequently asked questions where it says 

“What is the role of women in the church?” 

They try and say something along the lines of like 

“Women play an important role; they provide influence and they choose the songs, the hymns at every gathering.”

That's it.

There's no mention of the fact that they also run the campus and co stores that they are the you know pseudo school bus drivers running kids back and forth to school all the time that they are entertaining 20 to 30 people in their homes on a regular basis that they might have overnight guests for long periods of time sometimes only three or four days [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3061s) sometimes longer they're basically running hotels, restaurants, stores, school bus drivers, and they get to sit in the back rows of the meeting. Yeah, women do not sit with the men. They're relegated to the back.

They subscribe very strongly to the scripture that talks about a wife submitting to her husband and that seems to be their general doctrine and there's no question in my mind that it's where a lot of the abuse comes from in the Brethren, is from a young age boys are definitely taught that women are not [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3117s) valuable and it's sad, it's sad you know.

 I remember my mom saying that you know Eleanor Roosevelt was just not a good person because she was a major Women's Libber and it's like well, would you think that if you weren't trapped in the brethren?

I don't know. Everybody has their own viewpoints.

I feel like there's a bug on my glasses. Sorry, people.

Nature. It's not always my friend. Anyway, sorry. Lost my train of thought there. But yeah, women, I think they do a lot. I think behind the scenes, the women are an integral part of things, but they're not treated as such at all. Their opinions are definitely not valued.

And it's just kind of sad. So, anyway, here's my little thought for the day on the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

 Hi, everybody. So for my PBCC video today, I was recently asked in a comment on another one of my posts, like what goes on at these meetings? Like, is it a sermon by a priest or how does how does that work?

And I was like, yes, I've been meaning to do like specific videos on each meeting and I keep forgetting that I want to do that. So this was a great reminder and I'm going to kick that off now. But, I have to introduce it with every week at the Lord's Supper, or their communion, the announcements for the week were made by a specific brother. In my case, at my little [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3238s) or my attendant, it was my Uncle John. And it was, I guess, so you knew what meetings were when, even though they really generally didn't change.

But it would be like, I feel like it usually happened pretty early on in the Lord's Supper. It would be like time for the announcements, and he'd pick up the mic and be like, we'll have a reading this morning at 10 a.m., followed by preaching of the gospel.

Then this afternoon, we'll have another preaching of the gospel at 2:30, followed by an additional preaching of the gospel at 5 p.m. in Neche.

We'll have prayer meeting Monday night, ministry meeting Tuesday night, reading Wednesday night, reading Thursday night in Neche, meeting Friday night, Saturday morning meeting at 10 a.m., or if it was care meeting, which was, you know, when they give away their money, then it would be care meeting 6 a.m. Weeknight meetings to be held at 7:45 or something like that. 

I mean, kind of unsettled by how clearly I remember that, I guess. hearing it every week for the first 21 years of your life will do that to you? I don't know.

Anyways, so as far as is it a sermon by a priest, no. Brethren meetings are kind of hard to explain, but so how a Sunday would work is, so in each Brethren locality, you'd have like a couple priests and one would be like a more important priest and one would be a slightly less important priest.

But as I've said before, the Brethren meeting rooms are very much set up with a hierarchy and the closer to the center of the room you were, the more important you were. So if you were on the front row, very important. Second row, a little less important and back from there with women of course at the back of course so on a Sunday you'd have like the main leader of the locality [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3372s) you were where I grew up.

Brethren meeting rooms have all these small handheld microphones along with one big one. So he would pick up like a small microphone that was in front of him and he would say to another important brother on the front row, Mr. So-and-so, would you be willing to read the scriptures for us today? And Mr. So-and-so, because he's very humble, would always say, no, I wouldn't feel up to that.

And this would go on for sometimes, honestly, like 15 to 20 minutes at a time and it was like oh my gosh someone just read the scriptures like you're not all that humble we know you're not. The only time it happened faster is if someone had recently been in contact with Mr Hales or the “great man” whatever because then [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3435s) would have wisdom to impart to the rest of us. Because, I mean, they'd all but been in touch with God at that point.

So then it was a sure thing. It was pretty much guaranteed. I mean, if you'd been in touch with him in the last week or two, you're set. You're taking the meeting.

So then the big mike gets put in front of Mr. So-and-so. He's seated by the way. They remain seated for the reading. And he reads a few scriptures that he just happened to come up with on the fly because, of course, he wasn't prepared to do this.

You're sitting on the front row, dude. The front row dudes, always prepared.

Yeah. I mean, all very humble and not ready to do this, but always prepared.

Anyway, he'd read his scriptures. He'd kind of do a dialogue. I should say monologue, I guess. Got to work on my English here.

For about 10 minutes, and then he would say, would you have something to add, Mr. So-and-so? And he'd quite often go back to like the original leader guy that had asked him to take the meeting. And then it was kind of like a back and forth between like a bunch of front row dudes. Sometimes second row guys contributed, maybe even some third row, but unlikely. Once you got past about the second row, you were probably not contributing. You weren't that [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3536s) at that point. So, then, after that was done, that would usually last like, hmm, half hour, 45 minutes, depending on if they were long-winded or not. Then, it would be time for a preaching of the gospel. And that, on Sunday, was predetermined. So, like, three guys were asked to preach. Totally random.

You would usually get a call on, like, Saturday night. I remember thinking like, thank goodness, I'm a girl and this will never happen to me because like, cool, could I please stand up in front of like 500 people?

Oh, you know, me being so shy and stuff. How would I ever do that?

Anyways, these three guys would all preach the gospel. And that was definitely more like Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, or what they would read from and preach from. And I guess that was to save us, although, I mean, we're brethren, so we were saved. So, I'm not really sure. Good morning.

So, when I left off last time, I was talking about the brethren meetings. So, I had told you a little bit about their big Sunday meeting, the main meeting. But I realized afterwards the part I forgot was I should have mentioned that so during the readings the guy like taking the meeting stays seated, but during the preachings then they're standing up, so the mic, the big mic gets adjusted and they stand and that is just like one guy talking, there's no other input from someone else and when he's done the next guy hops up, says his thing. When he's done, the last guy gets up, says his thing. And then a hymn is given out, you know, by the women, because they're very important.

And then it's very specific at the end of the meeting. So there's always a hymn and a prayer at the end of the meeting. And the prayer has to be by the last guy that preached.

I don't have any idea what the significance of that was but it had to be. Nobody else could pray at the end of the meeting. Just that guy.

So then you'd go have your huge Sunday meals and when you're all full of food and alcohol and feeling fully peppy and ready to go for the day time for another meeting and I remember it being just like on a hot summer day you're dressed up of course as I've said [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3722s) women had to wear pantyhose you know protect their modesty and it was like it's hot I just want to be in like comfy clothes.

No. Brethren, especially the women's clothes, don't exactly scream comfort.

So back you'd go to meeting and it would be another preaching. Again, pre-selected guys. And I don't know, it was kind of weird.

Usually there was someone like selected in the locality, not necessarily one of the priests, that would like choose who was preaching. Again, you'd call up the guy the night before, usually Saturday night, and be like, hey, we'd like you to preach at this meeting. And when I was younger, they were like broken up into, again, the small local meeting rooms within a locality.

But then that kind of changed and went back to like, everyone got back together as a locality. So like Pembina as a whole was at theirs at 2:30, Neche would go back to theirs at 2:30, etc, etc. And then at five o'clock, that's when they sometimes switched up and like, so if meeting had been in Pembina for the big meeting, then it was in Neche for the last gospel of the day, or vice versa. 

[It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3807s) was actually sometimes really hard to keep track of like where are we supposed to be so I guess that's why they did the announcements at you know the Lord's Supper so you knew where you were supposed to be and you were not supposed to miss it.

So then at about 5:45 Sunday night you were finally done with meetings, so then the next meeting you attended would be Monday night and Monday night was again broken [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3837s) the small little meeting rooms within a locality. So if you live in one of these small Brethren towns, like you've probably seen these other little meeting rooms. They're like usually small windowless buildings. It seems like in the last few years they put up signs that say Plymouth Brethren Christian Church on them so you know.

And that's where like a small group of Brethren within that locality will go to that meeting room for like the Lord's Supper and prayer meeting.

And prayer meeting is exactly what it sounds like. That's all that happens there. And so you get there, and again, the men are in the front, women are in the back, but the difference is because it's such a small group, there was just like one circle of men and one circle of women. So the men were in the front row, women were in the second row.

And of course it would start out with a woman, in all her importance, choosing the hymn we were going to sing. We'd sing the hymn and then all of the men and boys took a turn praying. Stand up, holding a mic, and say a prayer.

And like the older you were the longer the prayer it seemed like you know everybody without question prayed for Mr. Hales the leader that was usually the first thing you know you'd start off the prayer and it was always pray for Mr. Hales and his family and then you'd pray for usually a lot of other like great men in the brethren, you know other current leaders which you have to kind of keep track, because sometimes they would [suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3945s) lose their seat of power and Oopsie\! Somebody just awkwardly prayed for a guy that got kicked out last night in Australia.

That's embarrassing\! 

Aren't supposed to be praying for him anymore, and there might be things like you know they're praying for other great men, they might be praying for or against a current law that's being looked at, elections, like there was a lot of things they would pray [for.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=3975s) 

So there was no set order. It was just everyone, male, took a turn right down to like as young as they could. Usually like young boys, like three years old, were taught how to do this. So all boys and men did this. It was finished up by one more song by a very important woman. And then that was it. You were done. And Monday nights [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4005s) pretty quick. Like it was usually maybe 20 minutes tops and you were out of there.

So I always quite enjoyed it. So then Tuesday nights were the next one. And I will tell you more about them tomorrow.

Hey everybody. So to continue my discussion about the PBCC meetings, I thought, hey, I should probably show you guys what the inside of a Brethren meeting room looks like. So this is what a Brethren meeting room looks like inside. So it's kind of hard to tell in this picture. I don't know, the angle is just a little different, but you can see it's kind of that dish shape. and yes they pretty much all have that disturbing [green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4054s) carpet. Some of the newer rooms have a little darker shade at least.

And yep those three doors open into like a big open foyer and that's where people like stand before and after meeting. The fluorescent lights made me laugh because in pretty much every meeting I ever attended I spent plenty of time counting the fluorescent lights that occupied my time. It's just a non-stop thrill ride.

Anyway, you can kind of see down there in the center the little freestanding mics that I'm talking about and then off to the left side there's like that taller one standing there and that was kind of what I was talking about when I said they'd use the small mics versus the big mic and yes, men in the front, women in the back. I can almost picture those button-down shirts and big scarves and yeah anyway, so [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4115s) I left off I had told you about Monday nights the prayer meetings so Tuesday night which was called their ministry meeting.

 I don't know why I don't I don't know what the significance was why it was called the ministry meeting. But anyways, Tuesday was also the only day you could get married on. So how the ministry meeting worked is, as usual, once everyone was there, the door was locked. I might have [forgotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4145s) to mention that the door always had to be locked. Once all the saints were in, you wouldn't want someone accidentally coming in.

So, you know, a very important woman would give out a hymn, say a number, we'd sing it, someone would stand up and pray, a man of course. And then ministry meeting was a little different. So the mic would be standing in the center of that front circle and it was always a little bit of a waiting game on Tuesday night because there was no set agenda. You just had to wait for someone to be [moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4184s) to speak to those of us blessed to be there and I can remember it being so excruciating, like sometimes someone would be motivated to hop up right away and like get the show on the road and sometimes you would sit there forever and ever and ever.

And I can remember actually like I never wanted my dad to be the one to speak [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4214s) I don't know why it was just awkward and weird but I can remember like a Tuesday night or two or possibly 29, sitting across from him, obviously Tuesday night was just a smaller local night so he would be in the front row then like most married men would be, and I was across the room sitting next to my mom in about row four or five and I can remember trying frantically to catch his eye, and if I did to like look at the mic, like get up [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4245s) say something, let's go. It never worked, not once, but I sure tried because come on, like, we just want to be done, we just want to go home.

Anyways one would go, sit down, and then the wait would begin again for the second brother to feel moved to speak and then you get to listen to them and they basically like get up, read a few scriptures [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4275s) speak on those scriptures for a little while.

It was just a monologue, a general ,it wasn't a preaching it was just kind of a general sermon usually didn't last more than like 10 minutes tops, it was pretty short and yeah once those two were done you'd have another hymn a prayer and you were done.

So Tuesday nights could be really fast if somebody like actually got up and got the show on the road [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4306s) you could sit there forever. It was great, anyway there you have it.

Hey everybody sorry I've been a little MIA but I'm getting back on track here.

 So when I left off, I was telling you about their specific meetings. So I'd finished up with Tuesday meeting, which I told you was the ministry meeting. And I had forgotten some of my other ex-Peeb friends reminded me. It was where they talk a lot about the current ministry from their leader. And I had forgotten that. Yes, that was why it was a ministry [meeting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4345s) So then Wednesday and Thursday night were actually very similar. They were both just called a “reading of the scriptures.” The only difference for me where I grew up was Wednesday night was held in Pembina and the brethren from Nieche, which was a town about 20 minutes away, would come there. And on Thursday nights, it was the exact opposite. The brethren from Pembina would [travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4376s) to Neche. So other than that, they were identical.

So basically how a reading worked was everyone's sitting down, obviously important men in the front row, less important as you go back, of course, putting women and young children in the far back.

So the leader of the brethren in that specific locality so like the leader in Pembina on Wednesday night would pick up one of the little mics and he would basically ask another brother or two or three you know,, would you be willing to read the scriptures for us tonight. Would you read the scriptures for us tonight, Mr. So-and-so. 

And it was super, like, [awkward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4430s) looking back on it now. I mean, it was awkward at the time, but when I look at it now, I just laugh because it was like, oh, once again, a show of how humble we all are. And like, no, no, I wouldn't feel up to it tonight. No, I wouldn't feel up to it tonight either. And back and forth they would go. and it was like, oh come on you're all just dying to do this and we know it, but whatever, so eventually some very humble man would decide that he could step up and do this so he would read a few [scriptures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4467s) that you know he just thought up on the fly because he certainly wasn't planning to do this.

And again it was kind of a like he would do a little monologue about it for five ten minutes and then turn to someone else and say, what are your thoughts on this Mr. So-and-so, and then it would kind of turn into a bit more of a dialogue .

The guy that was kind of leading the show would ask others to contribute or others would just contribute and usually it was just front row man. Once in a [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4502s) while someone in the second row would contribute, but that was about as far back as he went. And those lasted usually about 45 minutes, sometimes pushed an hour, and that got really long. 

Didn't like that at all.

 Again, a reading started with a hymn, you know, the very important action by the women and then a prayer by whoever male felt like they wanted to and ended the same way as soon as that brother that was taking the meeting pushed the big mic away from his face, boom, someone would [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4546s) out a hymn we'd sing, someone would pray and then we were done. And like I say, Wednesday and Thursday nights were exactly the same. So there you have it. More meetings.

Hey everyone, to continue my little saga on meetings in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, we're up to Friday night. So Friday nights were one of my favorite nights. If I was going to have a favorite, it would be Friday. And I think it was because if there was going to be a short meeting it would be Friday and it's the end of the week and it's Friday, it's Friday, everyone loves Friday.

But [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4589s) Friday meetings were kind of a wild card you never really knew what you get.

So they always started off the same way, you know, hymn, prayer and then the leader would pick up the mic and start asking different people, you know, to take the reading. And so you might have a reading Friday night, which was always a real letdown for me because readings tended to be a little bit longer, more similar to like a Wednesday night or Thursday night, just kind of a drag.

But you might, and me and my sisters always pushed my dad hard to suggest this, you might have some guy suggest we could have addresses if no one is willing to take the meeting and you're saying addresses? Where did she pull this term from?

No it wasn't where we started discussing where people lived.

This would be where, so say my dad was the one that said,

“Since it doesn't seem like anyone you know wants to take the reading maybe we should have addresses tonight.” 

So then the leader guy would be like, 

“Oh yeah we could do that Roger, you know who did you have in mind?”

And my dad would probably be like,

“ I didn't really have anyone in mind but you know who do you think?”

 So then randomly three [guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4685s) with no warning at all would get picked to address the group. So it would be a standing thing again, kind of like Tuesday night. The big mike would be standing in the middle of the circle and these three guys, you know, you, you, and you are picked to give an address. 

And so you could decline but like you weren't gonna get out of it odds were. I mean you just weren't. It's too bad, so sad \-  and so they might say, say the first one, the guy that was supposed to give the first one he might say like;

”Just bear with me, I need a few minutes.”

Because like you have to quickly come up with something you're gonna say on the fly. So then he would stand up, he'd read a few [scriptures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4736s) and he would say some words about these scriptures, and this is why they tended to be so short is like nobody had time to prepare, so it's not like you really had a plan of what you were going to talk about. 

So like a lot of times, unless it was like some older guy that spent all his time reading ministry and wanted to share with us the latest things he had read that Bruce Hales said, like odds were the addresses were going to be short and once those three were done [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4766s) hymn, prayer, boom, done and Friday nights could be over in like 20 minutes and it was fantastic.

 So that was always my goal on Friday nights was to strongly suggest addresses would be the way to go. And like the general celebration among like young unmarried people, you could just see the joy when addresses were suggested because we all felt the same way. Like just get us out of [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4796s) We just were ready to be done. So anyway, Friday nights in the cult.

Good morning friends. And so, sorry I've been MIA lately. Life is kind of busy and, yeah, busy. Anyway, when I left off, I was talking about the meetings and the only day of the week I had left was Saturday, I think.

So, Saturdays were kind of a weird day. You could either have the early morning meeting, which was, you know, white envelope day, 6 a.m. meeting. and it was always so annoying to me because my mom always made me and my sisters attend that one and hardly any women and children did, like there would maybe usually be like 20 of us there and I was always like, really mom it's not like we contribute, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4850s) we're not allowed to have an opinion. 

So we're just sitting here at the crack of dawn or before dawn when we could be at home sleeping. Anyway, there we were. So the rest of the time, if it wasn't that one, like the care-meeting Saturday, then it was just like a regular reading and you'd have like, sometimes another locality would attend. In fact, I feel like usually there was a couple localities, and so it was kind of very much along the lines of like a Wednesday night, and that would be held a little later in the day, 9, 10 o'clock. So that was kind of how Saturdays went. So you never got a free day. Actually, that was the only good thing about care-meeting Saturday was you sort of had a free day because you were out of meeting by 7am [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4905s) then you had the rest of the day to actually like have a life for a second.

So anyway, there's the last little bit on meetings. 

Hey everybody, I just wanted to take the time to answer a couple questions I've gotten about meetings in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. So one of the questions I got was, what happens if you miss a meeting? So this one is kind of funny to me because it directly relates to how I got [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4941s) of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

.So my mom bless her heart actually felt like it was too much to expect us girls to get up ,go to work, come home, supper, shower, go to meeting, come home, go to bed, get up do it all again, over and over and over with zero time to like recharge or just relax. And it was true she kind of came to this when my oldest sister had gotten sick, like really sick with like I think mono or something like that, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=4987s) my mom was basically like, you know what this is, just too harsh of a schedule, so she started allowing us girls to miss one night of meeting a week we could choose.

And generally speaking I would choose Wednesday or Thursday night because they were the longest meetings of the week and so you had your most time on your own if you will, and initially when we started it was like all three of us girls would miss and then it went to you know, what we all kind of just took a different night because we realized that hey, it was really nice to just have some peace and quiet, some time [100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5035s) by yourself because I mean you still live at home with mom and dad there's no alone time, like there's no time you are 100 on your own unless you want to sit in your bedroom with the door shut.

But even then you're gonna have maybe an hour and then it's time to go to meeting or you know there's there was just zero time to just recharge on your own. 

So that actually is how I got away was it was the [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5066s) night that I chose to miss meeting which wasn't an unusual thing, and I left, so I often think back and wonder if my mom wishes she wouldn't have allowed us to do that.

I have to think that God would have figured out another way for me to get out of there. Because he knew it was what I needed. But it sure worked out good for me.

But as far as other people missing meetings, so like very, very much not okay for like a head of household to miss meetings. So like for my dad to miss meeting, not recommended.

If he did, it wouldn't be at all unusual for someone after meeting to like ask one of us girls or my mom like, so is Roger okay? You know, to just miss meeting for the sake of missing meeting? No, he needed to be like sick, unwell.

And for both my parents to miss meeting at the same time like one better be hospitalized like it just it just wasn't allowed, like you just didn't do that. So generally like if my dad truly was sick and could not get to meeting then my mom and us girls would still go, if my mom was sick my dad and us girls would still ago, if us girls were [sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5162s) it depended on the age, like when I was young obviously my mom would stay home with one of us but once we got to be about you know mid-teens absolutely not, you're on your own which is fine, like usually if you're truly sick you're you're in bed.

The one meeting that really was frowned upon to miss was the Lord's supper so like I always chuckled, I'm like you were home sick with a cold, cough, flu all week [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5192s) yes you should attend the one meeting where you're like sharing a cup with everyone else ,sticking your hands in a loaf of bread that everyone else is gonna touch ,yum, awesome\!

So yes kids were a little more, like there was a little more flexibility, like grace I should say like if you missed a meeting, it was kind of like well [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5222s) you shouldn't, meeting is the most important part of your day but there was a little more grace allowed \-  but the heads of household no, and even the woman you know, no, not as bad as the guy but men needed to be at meeting so there you go, that's what happens if you miss meeting. 

Yep the door is actually locked yeah no windows, because [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5253s) wouldn't want the distractions of the outside world to come into meeting and yes there is a designated like, usually it's a unmarried guy that's like in his late teens early 20s and he is the designated like door locker for lack of better word, and he stands out there in the entryway until as far as he can tell everyone [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5283s) there.

So like you'll see him come and like lurk in the doorway between the foyer and the actual meeting room and he's kind of looking around to see if it looks like everyone's there, and if he thinks they are then he locks the door.

And so like in Pembina our meeting room was a little bit newer and so it had a doorbell so if you were late you could ring the doorbell and then someone would get up [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5313s) and let you in.

But in Neche, their meeting room was a million years old. I mean, not quite, but it was old. And so you had to bang on the door. And I do mean like bang on the door. And then someone would come and let you in.

And once in a great while, some like, I was gonna say, unknowing individual Jill would knock on the door or ring the doorbell, but honestly, sometimes it was like worldly people just wanting to mess with the brethren, and I think, and would come and knock on the door. 

And then it was like quite this like kerfuffle. Oh my goodness. Like someone was trying to get in. Oh, yeah. Door is locked. 

And this is something that I just think, you know, they're deemed a church and get church tax status but the door is locked, it is not a public place of worship and in fact if you want to attend a meeting you can talk to a brother an individual and there's like one meeting on Sunday that they will allow an outsider to come, but like you have to sit [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5388s) way in the back and like they don't just allow you to just come you have to like have shown an interest in wanting to join the Brethren and gone through a lot of steps.

It's not like just random Joe off the street can be like, hey, I'd like to observe this one time. No, no, no. You have to like basically prove that you're wanting to join the Brethren and then you can maybe come and sit in the back. And I literally remember hearing about this happening twice in my life. I've never witnessed it. So that shows you how often that actually takes place. 

So yeah, not exactly a [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5430s) place of worship, but yeah, doors are locked, no windows, wouldn't want any distractions from the outside world. So there you have it. So another question that I got about meetings in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church was at what age does a young boy move from sitting in the back with the women and children to sitting in the front with the men? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5461s) so just to kind of give you a visual I thought I'd show you this picture. So all those white shirts are men. Now this one is a little deceiving this picture because it is clearly of like special meetings so that's why there's even more men than usual. Usually it's not quite that extreme, although there is usually more men than women. But yep, you can clearly see men in the white shirts in the center and the women are on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5491s) outside. They're giant colorful scarves.

Anyways, so if you have a young boy, eventually he needs to go and sit in the boys section and there's really no exact set age this has to happen although usually like three is kind of the oldest a boy would be sitting back with his mom it could be as young as like nine months old that the dad will take the son kind of the biggest factor is how important is dad? Is dad a front row guy? Because if dad's a front row guy, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5535s) that kid needs to be somewhat well behaved because we wouldn't want him to be a distraction because some people might be more interested in watching the antics of a young kid than listening to the meeting, and by some people I mean me. I was some people.

I would always rather watch a funny little kid than listen to a meeting, just saying. So anyways, it could be, like I say, as young as nine months old, it could be a little bit older, but eventually dad would start taking care of the boy. And boys would sit with their dads until usually 11 or 12 years old, and then they could go and sit in other rows with other young men. [Whereas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5586s) girls generally continued to sit with their mom until they got married. So you still went and sat by your mom until you got married, and then you would go... If you moved away to another locality then you would go and sit with your mother-in-law but even if you didn't move to another locality say you married a guy that was like local you would still go from sitting with your mom to now you would [generally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5616s) sit with your mother-in-law.

Once in a while you had some crazy person that still continued to sit with their mom even after they were married and like, whoo\! talk about breaking protocol\! wild\! 

anyway the other thing that used to cause quite the stir is once in a great while say you had a young married couple that like maybe they had a couple little kids and say mom is [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5646s) sick with one or you know the other kid is sick so mom's home with them and dad brings the one little girl to meeting and dad might be allowed to have the little girl sit with him, obviously again not on the front row, but that always caused quite a stir because then you had like a little girl sitting in the guy's ranks.

Wild\! Yeah.

Did not happen very often, but it was allowed occasionally. Like if say, like I said, mom was home with a sick kid, maybe grandma was like not at meeting because otherwise dad would give the little girl to grandma to look after.

But once in a while, the one and only time in your life, a girl could possibly be sitting in those center rows. And that like never over the age of like three or four. I don't even know three. Three might be exceeding it. Yeah, big stuff.

Hey everyone, so I just wanted to share. The Plymouth Brethren have this new series, I mean new-ish, on YouTube, and I guess it's an attempt to show how non-cult-y they are.

Well, I'll just jump right into it. Ta-da\!

Our Neighbors, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, right under Living Our Beliefs. Mm-hmm.

Yeah. Isn't that adorable?

So, yeah, I guess to just read the caption under most of them is very similar to slight variations, but the main gist is;

“Some people incorrectly call us the exclusive brethren, but the truth is that we are very much part of the neighborhood where we live, work, and worship and have for over 200 years.”

But are you though? Are you?

Yeah. So they have a handful of these videos, our neighbors, and they all seem to be focused in Orange Australia.

And I really wish they had put out a general call because I think there's a lot of neighbors that might not have been quite as you know pleasant in their videos.

But yeah, my next question is so asking for a friend here [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5837s) you're in a church like part of a congregation, has your church ever come to you and said, hey, can you have your neighbors who aren't part of this church do a video saying what good people you are because you're part of this church?

I'm just curious.

Because I feel like that's not like a normal thing to do, but what do I know? I was raised in a cult. I don't always know what normal is. I mean, these people will not sit down and have a meal with you. They aren't going to come and sit around a fire pit in the backyard and have a drink. They aren't going to come over and have coffee on the deck some nice summer morning.

Their kids are not going to come into your house and play, and your kids are not going to be invited into their house to play.

Most people often complain they actually aren't good neighbors. They drive too fast. They have little regard for people's properties.

And it's actually funny because I was showing one of my friends one of these videos and I was just like, oh, like, look at this. It's so embarrassing. Like, it's just trying too hard. And she was immediately like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. She's like, why wasn't I asked?

Silly me I kind of forgot she's literally like surrounded by brethren and properties, like she has brethren live in the property behind, her next to her like a mega mansion is going up and she's like, my video would probably say something like they're literally doing construction until midnight 1 a.m. there's no regard for their neighbors whatsoever as far as like crank up the music and, you know, air nailers, air [compressors,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=5971s) you name it, going until whatever time of day. She's like, they happily walk all over my property without asking if it's okay or they park on my property.

Yeah, great neighbors.

I don't know.

So, this whole thing just kind of reeks of desperation, but they sure are trying to show us what good people they are, aren't they?

I wonder who they're trying to convince, us or themselves?

Just curious.

Good morning, everyone. So for today's PBCC video, I thought I would talk a little bit about one of the joys, if we want to call it that, that comes with talking publicly about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

And it's one of the things that kind of slows me down sometimes and pushes me off track.

I, like a lot of other humans, have my mental health struggles and sometimes messages and comments can suck the life right out of you.

And I remember learning once, it's years ago now, that your brain is literally trained to remember the bad and forget the good. And I've never heard anything so accurate in my life, because for every bad message or comment I get, I probably get 50 good. But boy, those bad ones, they tend to hit a little harder.

And 90% of the time they are what I consider to be bought accounts I'm sure by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. A lot of them have similar names, biblical, and a lot of the time it's private messages. Occasionally it will be direct comments. Usually that's on my Instagram posts. And I've blocked a lot of [accounts,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=6123s) but they always reappear as something else. And because I have my Plymouth Brethren Christian Church posts set as public, anyone can see them. And I realize that's a risk I'm willing to take. I put it out there because I want everyone to see it. I don't want it to be just limited to my friends because you already know the story. I'm trying to reach more [people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Nl3ftLStU&t=6153s) But it's just a very real fact of speaking out about the Brethren, and it's one more reason why to me, you know, they claim to be a mainstream Christian church.

I don't know about you, but I am familiar with a lot of mainstream Christian churches and I don't know any that the members of a church actively attack and say ugly, horrible things about someone just because they're choosing to not go to said church anymore.

That just doesn't happen, generally speaking. But it is a reality with the Brethren. So I just thought I would put it out there. When I go MIA for a while, sometimes it's, I just kind of need to reset from some of those. And I'm sorry, because I should be stronger. I should be used to this by now.

And I should not take it so seriously. But boy, it seems like sometimes they really know exactly what button to push with me. So yeah, it's a fun struggle that I think any and all of us that have spoken out against the Brethren deal with.

I know personally of a lot of others that deal with it as well. So anyway, I just thought I'd share.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
