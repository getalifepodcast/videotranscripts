## Summary

Tina Nystrom walks us through her families journey when they decided together to leave the PBCC. Tina has been extremely effective in holding the PBCC to account in Sweden. Numerous newspaper articles and TV programs have exposed the ugly mysogeny and homophobia that OneSchool Global has tried to hide from the Swedish public - taxpayers who are unwillingly funding this cult school - despite the fact that the PBCC businesses are extremely wealthy, and the brethren live in grand mansions in the most exclusive suburbs.  Tina has accomplished all this on her own - with only about 700 brethren in Sweden, the number of ex-members is also very small. We salute her courage and invite her to join our international team of truth-tellers! We also hope her families success in gaining freedom inspires others inside to know they can walk away as a strong family unit.

This is the Get A Life podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=7s)

Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode of Get A Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. Our guest today comes all the way from Sweden, a former member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, Tina Nystrom, who's done some excellent work in exposing them in that cold and distant country. So without further ado, Tina, please start off just by introducing yourself and telling us a little bit about your history [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=37s) the PBCC.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=39s)

Yeah, sure. I was born in Bristol, actually. My father was Bristolian and my mother Swedish. So we moved to Sweden in 1970 and we moved to Stockholm. So I was in a Stockholm church, Stockholm congregation.

And we were only four families there. It was us and then it was two brothers and another family. So it was a very, very small group of people.

And we also, the biggest meetings in Sweden is in Smålandstenar or in Ljungby and nowadays they also have them in Gothenburg. We had them in Gothenburg also but it's much bigger than now.

And well, just to fast forward, we, the whole family decided to leave in 1990\.

We had had enough. We, me, I used to work for a company, a worldly company as I call it. And I had a computer as a, I work with computers, of course, like everybody else did.

And so did my father and my sister but they were kind of, yeah, they were pushing us to to leave the businesses and start to work for the brethren instead.

And yeah, and both me and my sister thought that that was no, we don't want to go back. I mean, it was just moving backwards and going back to typewriters and stuff instead of going forwards with computers. So for us it was really, really, no, we don't want to go backwards in our, in the hour, yeah. So for us it was kind of weird, and, well my dad was [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=164s) a fantastic man. He was, yeah, from Bristol and he was very, very, very well respected of a lot of brethren. But we had a hard time anyway. I think that he was treated a bit unfairly of a lot of the brethren. And well, there's a lot of small things that made us decide that one day now this is enough. We've had enough. We're going to leave. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=195s) it was actually just a Monday, just before the Monday meeting, Dad collected us in a, he said, come talk to us in the kitchen. So we were all talking in the kitchen and said, what should we do?

And he said, shall I just call him and say that we're done? And we all said, yeah, let's do that. I have three siblings. So it was six of us. Wow. Yeah.

And all of us, none of us were married, so we were all single and so we left as a family. And I think that made a big impact in Sweden. Nobody had left voluntarily at all since I was born. And I think it was kind of Aberdeen that people left.

In 1970, that was the last time that people voluntarily left the Plymouth Brethren. So I think it made a big impact because we noticed later that a lot of brethren had to move to Stockholm. So that was kind of interesting. All of a sudden a lot of brethren moved to Stockholm just to fill in the gaps.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=272s)

Kind of, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=275s)

Yeah, so how old were you when you actually left the UK?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=282s)

Oh, the UK, I was two when we left the UK.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=285s)

So you don't have too many memories of it, yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=288s)

No, no, I don't. No, not at all.

But, yeah, so I'm Swedish more or less, but, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=298s)

I mean, I have, I know a little bit about Stockholm because it would be, I mean I was born in Cambridge, lived in Cambridge for like 40 years and my father was a very clever, well engineer, but physicist really, but he was good at building, engineering and he built the, he effectively built the Cambridge city [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=328s) room and he was also got very involved in in the Stockholm meeting room and that would all have been around the 1990s. Now what was the Stockholm, did they build their new city room before or after you you left?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=342s)

After.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=342s)

Okay, so you're probably, it's probably just after you'd gone. My father spent quite a lot of time in Stockholm staying with Freddie Lidbeck. And so we knew Freddie quite well. I didn't go, but Freddie also came and visited us in the UK. So, you know, I'm quite familiar with the Stockholm situation, how few brethren there were there.

And I know most of the people and, you know, I remember the Bundys kind of being referred to in some kind of negative connection at that time. I don't remember the detail, but I guess that was the fallout from you leaving. I mean, it's very unusual for a whole family just to decide to leave like that. Most of the people we speak to, families have been divided and there's been a lot of ill feeling.

Would the very smallness of the kind of congregation there, would that have been made it more difficult for you? I mean, we tend to find that in very small congregations, there you get a lot of personal feeling and there's this kind of what I call cabin fever. You've got these very small number of people and they are only social interaction with each other and that can lead to a lot of stress. Was that the kind of thing you experienced?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=423s)

Definitely, because the other two families were brothers.

They had the connection there. Then we were the outsiders, they're from England. So yeah, definitely. And then the big thing also, I think, was that we were working for worldly companies. Yes. So we were kind of worldly, they would say.

And especially my sister and I, we worked for companies that do forklift trucks. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And that was kind of boyish kind of thing. So all the guys in Smålandstenar, they used to talk to us about these forklift trucks and so on. And I think that was kind of the Bundy girls, they're kind of worldly and they're not so Christian and so I would say modest female sisters. They were not that type.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=481s)

No, you didn't conform to the stereotype of being meek and submissive.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=489s)

No, not really.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=492s)

I suspect you probably never will.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=496s)

No, no. And seeing, I mean, working for a worldly company, we had a completely different way of speaking and thinking and also that we used to go in normal public schools. And I mean, from there, we got all the impressions from the world. So.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=517s)

Yeah. I mean that's a really important subject because as you, I mean a lot of the focus of what you've been doing has been exposing their schooling system and for our generation where we did go to public schools that was really our salvation in the sense that we understood from a quite a young age that people out there are not actually different from us and they're no better or worse, we're not actually a super race.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=546s)

No, and there's a choice. There is a choice. You can choose to live another way. But I mean, today they don't have the choice, these kids.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=557s)

No, they don't. They don't even know the choice exists, let alone have it.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=565s)

Exactly. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=566s)

So tell us a little bit more about what was the aftermath of leaving for the family.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=573s)

Yeah, well actually speaking about the brethren, I don't know too much actually what went on. I just know that there was a lot of talk about what we had done and how worldly we were. We had been to the movies and we had done stuff like that. It never happened. We had never ever done anything like that. But I guess that's their way of, yeah, how to say, just to make sure that we were so worldly, that was why [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=603s) were leaving. Yeah, we had to condemn you in some way. Exactly, exactly. So and and that really pissed me off actually because my daddy wasn't worth that talk actually. Yes. So yeah, so that wasn't, yeah but it's their way of doing it and it's their way of making sure that nobody else will leave. 

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=630s)

Because, yeah, we have to justify it in their minds, because the idea that someone would just happily make that decision is just too much for their mind to consider. But, what did you like, what did your family use, uh, to build your social circle after? Like what did you guys, you know, go to events to try and meet people and to make family friends or did you use your business?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=651s)

We used our businesses. See, we were actually all of us working for worldly companies, we had the network at our offices. So that was easy. And my youngest brother, he went back to school. So he went back to high school. Yeah, he did. So he's an engineer today.

And my mother started working, which was good for her.

And yeah, that was our way to, so it was kind of easy actually for us seeing we already had a business, work in worldly companies. But it was strange because it was kind of from one day to another at work. We suddenly could sit and eat with everybody. And it was kind of, what's this? Of course, we have done it a little bit before, but not in the same way as we did then. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=708s) also we could go to after works and people were like, are you going to come?

So that was kind of weird. And then suddenly I had a haircut and everybody's noticed that it's kind of like cut your hair. What's happened?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=723s)

That's amazing.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=725s)

Yes, it is. It is. So it was noticeable for them also that something had happened. So, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=736s)

The one thing that was a little shocking, I think, is that after all the money and effort have been put into building a new meeting hall in Stockholm, the whole meeting there gets closed down and all the brethren move out. Did you kind of know anything about that? Did sort of rumors about that leak to the outside?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=757s)

No, and actually I live on the opposite side of Stockholm, so I've kind of, I don't want to see them and I don't want to hear anything about them for many, many years. I mean, this is actually now that I feel free to speak about them and to do these things, because I haven't really, I just wanted to put that side of my life away. So I haven't actually been listening to what has been said or, but as I gather it, it was that they wanted everybody [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=788s) and about the schools for the kids. Yes. It was too far for the kids to travel from Stockholm to Smålandstenar for the school.

That was one of the reasons I think.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=800s)

Yeah, I suspected that that was the underlying reason. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=805s)

So in spite of having a relatively easy departure in the sense of going out as a family, you still feel there's quite a lot of trauma associated with your time in the church that you've taken a long time to process.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=820s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, we were all living at home when we left. My brother was 30, I was 22, 23 and it was, we didn't want to live in with our parents. It was kind of, okay, how do we do now? We need to find apartments  and when I moved out from my parents when I was 24 perhaps into my own apartment and it was great for say six months but I had to move home again because it was so [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=851s), it was so weird and I couldn't handle it actually. 

So I had to move back home and not having people around and being alone and in this world it was it was just too much and that was kind of traumatic actually. It was, it's not, it was, yeah, it was hard. And then all the stuff with dating and you know, stuff like that, it's not easy when you when [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=881s) come from this world, but as I said, we had, we had, we were kind of used to guys and I think we worked in the company with a lot of guys, so I wasn't very afraid of speaking to men but I know that there are a lot of women that leave that are afraid to speak to men. So it's, I guess situations that are weird.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=905s)

Yes. Is Sweden quite a secular country or is there a kind of a Swedish national church that a lot of people belong to? I mean how's Christianity generally regarded in Sweden?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=918s)

No, it's not a lot of, no people don't usually go to church here, it's not, no. There's a lot, we have a lot of, I would say mosques, is that what you call them? Yes, yeah. And there are the Jehovah's Witnesses, I don't know what they're called. Yes, same. It's at Jehovah's, yeah. But it's not a country where people generally go to church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=947s)

Right. So how did you, would you have said there was a certain amount of what I call religious trauma associated with having been in the brethren? I mean, was that something you had to process as well, trying to sort out in your mind, you know, all the kind of hellfire and damnation side of things?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=968s)

Yeah, well, that was, I, I had to sort that out during my whole life, actually, since I was a kid. I remember going to school and thinking we were taught about the Buddhism and all the other religions. And I was just thinking to myself, how come that we, we are three families in Stockholm? How come that we are those that are on the right? And how can it, is it only space for us up with Jesus and not all these? And it was so weird for [me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=998s) I couldn't figure it out.

And as you said, all this with damnation and stuff, that was terrifying when we left. I had a lot of problems with that because I thought that as soon as I do something that is worldly, something's going to happen. Yeah. Yes. When I went to the movies the first time, it took about six months before I dared to even go into the movie theater. And I remember sitting there and just thinking, I was looking around thinking, okay, what's going to happen? Is it going to burn? Is it going to be a fire? [Is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1032s) it going to be earthquake? What's going to happen? Because something bad will happen now.

Nothing happened. And I can't remember what film we saw. I have no idea. Because I couldn't enjoy it at the one because I was so scared that something was gonna happen.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1047s)

Yeah, it's hard to explain to outsiders how strong that fear is. Yeah, that fear is not of death, which you know is normal people's ultimate fear. It's of eternal torture, right? Like, like going to a place that's just gonna burn you forever. Like it's, it's a serious fear.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1067s)

And that is that what I keep telling people or the journalists that I talk to because they can't understand this fear. But I tell them that is what it's all about. It's fear that if you're not doing, if you don't away and do what they say, you're going to go to hell. So that's what everything is about in this with the brethren. And they kind of, okay, so you've been living in fear all your life. And I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1097s), yeah, that's exactly what I've been doing. Fear of coming, going to hell.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1103s)

I recently was talking to an insider and they were showing me the Connect app and all the pictures. And I saw pictures of people I knew and they look 40 years older than they should. All of them. And I personally, this is my own opinion, I think that there is a consequence physically to the body to living your entire life in fear, in constant fear of [committing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1133s) a sin, yeah. Their fear, it ages them and makes them sick. That's my personal belief.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1139s)

Yeah, I mean, look at the color of their faces and everything. They're just gray. They're, they're large, they're big, all of them of course, but they will look as you say, they look 40 years older. I've seen pictures of, people of brothers and sisters the same age as me, mostly brothers, I see them on a company. And I was kind of, seriously, he's that young person, looks like he's 70\. But it's so interesting to see and I'm kind of, [thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1169s) God I didn't get married.

I was so thankful when I saw this, I was quite keen on him and I look at him now, no thank you.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1185s)

I think it's a consequence of not loving yourself, and they're constantly taught to hate themselves, which is very, very detrimental. And the constant fear, fear of sinning and making a mistake, even though the rules are very, very gray. You know, it's, and that turns into sicknesses and, I don't know, just makes them look very old.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1213s)

They don't realize, that's the thing is they don't realize the fear that they're under, right? No, because it's so brainwashed into them that they have no clue that they're living inside this bubble of fear until you get out, right? When you get out and then it's like you're looking at this whole world and then you realize what is stuffed inside you and then you've got to learn how to unpack it, right? 

It's for me, that was therapy. I had to do therapy. I had to be able to sit with somebody that didn't know [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1243s) and allow me, they had to, it was almost like they were witnessing me talking and then being able to give a perspective that I needed to be able to break through that brainwashing and grasp that piece of me.  I firmly believe that every person has a piece of them that's intangible. It's, it's in there. It's in there. I mean, you can connect that to whatever you want, but I firmly believe that every person alive has a piece of them that is, it's untouchable, but you have to be able to willing to [shed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1273s) the layers to get back to that part of you. And that's hard when you've been brainwashed from birth.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1279s)

Yeah.

And the thing that you should, you shouldn't think that you are anybody. I mean, the thing that you're nobody, that is also kind of a thing that I've really struggled with. The constant, especially as a woman, you don't think that you know anything, you're nothing. I mean just sit back and be quiet. For me that doesn't come natural to me.

I'm really sorry but it doesn't. And I think it's so really, I think it's that for a lot of women but they actually have to push it back.

And yeah, it's anyway, all of this with the journalist and that started because I posted, I did a post on LinkedIn, where I actually just thanked my, my bosses, my managers, that they believed in me that much that they gave me a manager position. And I've managed over six people, both men and women. So I just posted thank you for believing in me and for all the managers that I've had backwards in my career. And I said that this was not what was planned for me. This was definitely not what my future looked like for when I was a kid.

I was supposed to be married and I was supposed to just be a housewife but I'm not. So I'm here now and that I think that post was seen by I think 27,000 people on LinkedIn. Absolutely amazing. And I had so many comments and people were just kind of, what's this? And wow, great for you to get out and it was just amazing. I didn't think that it would do [anything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1402s) It was a personal thanks to my bosses really.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1406s)

But you felt the love. You felt the love.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1409s)

I did. I really did. And it was just a spontaneous thing. I did one evening. I was kind of, oh, but hey, I'll just do this and post this on LinkedIn. I didn't really think about it. But after that, a journalist contacted me and she works for the union in Sweden, one of the unions that I'm actually connected to. And she wanted to do an article about me because she thought that was kind of fascinating. And from that, it's just spinned [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1439s) to a lot of articles, a lot of people, a lot of, yeah. And here we are today.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1446s)

And do you find that when you get the courage to come out and talk, that you find you're like building that self-esteem back up again?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1455s)

Definitely, definitely. And this is kind of, this is,, as I say, this is therapy for me. I talk about it all the time. I process it and everybody asks me different questions that I haven't thought about before. That's why I like speaking about it because they, they bring up a different view, they bring up a different question. I was kind of, oh yeah, that was, I forgot about that. That was something I haven't talked about., [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1485s) it's really interesting, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1489s)

And I do, I think it's really important for the, I mean, not, I'm not discrediting the men at all, but I think it's super important for the the ex-PBCC members, the female, to find a way to get that voice because it is so suppressed in there. I mean, I don't know if you saw their most recent email that came came my way, right? And it was, you know, condemning me of self-publicizing and you know, needing the need and I was like a number one, uh, girl, like if you, I mean, obviously I've [received](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1519s) another email, I kind of know who it is, but anyhow is, is like, no, this is, it's a female and she doesn't realize she's still in that brainwashed era of like, I need to be quiet. No, we don't need to be quiet. We have to learn how to overcome all of that stuff, bring ourself forward. I mean, it's not easy. And I mean, you can, you can comment on this, but I find for myself every time I still get butterflies.

 I still, when I'm done, it still is, I'm second guessing everything that I that I said [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1549s) then I'm back in therapy and I'm like talking it out and working it to the point where I have to be able to just be me in the public's eye, in my own home. It's how can you as a female that was so suppressed and in my case, I mean, I literally had no way to speak up of what was happening to me. It's at every point I have to be able to get that part of me, dig her up a little bit more and get her on her feet. Do you find that that is the same for yourself [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1579s) you've taken these opportunities to be able to stand back up on your feet as a female?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1585s)

Yes, but I think I was, I was kind of strong anyway from the beginning. But I think that the more I dig into myself, the more I realize I've just pushed it away.

It's been suppressed. And now it's more popping up. And I'm kind of realizing and I need therapy again. Yeah. Because this was, I mean, this end, it was 30, 1990 since we left. So it's a long time ago. But still there's things that I need to process, need to work through. And I was, I was young when we left. I was kind of just 22\. So I hadn't had, I mean, it was worse for my mother and father, definitely.

And I won't go into how they feel or my father's not alive anymore, but I won't go into how they have processed and handled this. But I think that I've got the farthest seeing I actually talking about it and I mean, I don't, I'm not bothered talking about it anymore. I mean, I've been on television and I was just so, it was just, yeah, ask me anything. And I felt so comfortable speaking about it [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1655s) I was so calm. And I think that seeing I, yeah, I've been processing it on the way during this time when I've been speaking to many people and I speak a lot to my colleagues a lot and to my, to those that I manage. They are, they've been all extremely interested. They kind of, we can't understand that you have been in this cult. How is that possible? And they are actually realizing [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1685s) that I've, I've had two lives. I've had a life before and I have a life after. And a lot of things that we sit and talk over coffee, we talk about, remember this TV show and remember this and this. And I'm just saying, no, I don't. Oh, of course, yeah, yeah, of course you don't.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1703s)

Yeah, yeah, I hate to have questions.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1705s)

I mean, but they're generally interested and,, uh, yeah, and I just, you just feel a lot of love actually. A lot, the more you open up, the more love you get.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1720s)

Yeah. 100%, you could not, what, that is such an important statement right there. That's exactly what it is.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1727s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1728s)

Because I mean, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1729s)

I think a lot of that leave are ashamed of what they've been through and were embarrassed by it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1736s)

Exactly, embarrassed.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1739s)

But it's nothing. I mean, we didn't choose it. I never chose to be in the brethren. I was born into it. So it was would be a different thing if I went into a cult now, that would be my own choice. But seeing I didn't and and my choice was to leave.

So that is much, so people kind of admire that. And I'm kind of like, that time wasn't that good. Tough cookies. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1774s)

I really hope this inspires families in there to know that they can do this, that they can just get up, pick up and move out as a whole system.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1781s)

I've got firsthand just information on that these podcasts are working and that people are listening and starting to question things because this person told me he had been listening to the podcasts and starting to question the things for the first time and felt like terrible listening to them at first and then started having thoughts that they'd never allowed them to think before. And then [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1812s) decided to finally confess it to their wife and found out that the wife was watching the podcast as well and has been questioning things as well.

So talking about these things and hearing these stories like from all different parts of the world, it's all the same cult is so important because we go through thinking that we're the only ones. You know, we have all these friends on the outside, right? Yeah, I was brought up in a cult. I know it's weird. But then you talk about it, and someone else reaches out to you that was also ex-member and that, you know, me and Cheryl connect and then me and Richard and me and Carman and, and all of a sudden, you start bringing all these stories [out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1856s) And it makes you feel a lot better when you can talk about it with people who understand.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1861s)

Exactly. We didn't have anybody. When we left, we just left and we had us, the family. We reconnected with my grandparents, grandfather and grandmother that we hadn't seen since I was a baby and my mother and father met their parents again. Amazing. I got to know my cousins that I had never met.

I'm thankful I got to know my grandparents again for a couple of years before they passed. So it's that also those connections that you haven't had. I never had a grandmother or a grandfather growing up.

But then we as a family, we had each other. I remember we left first of September and then that Christmas, we thought we're going to do something together as a family. So we went to London and we booked a hotel. We didn't know how to book a hotel for the first thing. And then and then when we came to the airport, that's also kind of a thing that's stuck to me, we came to the airport and nobody was there to meet us. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

It was suddenly, okay, how do we take it? Do we take a cab? What do we do? Because you're used to somebody standing there and greeting you and taking you home and.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1941s)

You can always, isn't it interesting how you could always pick them out like even though even though they dress somewhat normally but a brethren remember, you know, that's him. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1950s)

I mean, even if you can't, even if you can't see them, you can probably smell the alcohol on their breath.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1955s)

Exactly. You look for the gray people.

Oh, that's funny. Yeah, so sure, that was really interesting. So and then just going out to the restaurant and eating, do we tip them? What do we do? How do we order? Do we order all the whole meal at once or just the starters. It was so weird, everything. But we did it as a family. That's awesome. So incredible. And I remember we had, it was that time when the CD records came and they had the big mega stores with the CD [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=1993s) records. And I remember we went in there and it was floor after floor with different music and I was kind of, oh, is that really?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2003s)

That must have been amazing. That must have been such an exciting feeling.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2007s)

It was fantastic. It was music everywhere. And I was kind of, I need, I wanted to buy something, but I didn't know what to buy. It's kind of, okay, where? And so I, I think I just ended up buying something that I thought looked cool. It looked kind of, yeah.

I bought Bruce Springsteen. Oh, that was a good one. There you go. Yeah, interesting thing because he was, I knew who he was. So it's kind of, okay, let's buy him.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2034s)

I remember one time being in a store like that too. It was one of my first times and the person in the store just asked me, what kind of music do you like? And I was like, I have no idea. I had no clue. 

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2046s)

No. No, no, I just said Abba. Everybody knew who that was.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2053s)

Oh, that's amazing. That's amazing.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2056s)

Yeah. So.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2057s)

Your family must have had a lot of laughs doing things for the first time.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2061s)

We did. We did. We went to Madame Tussauds there also the first time. And I can say I didn't recognize any of the dolls. It was just the royal family. The royal family. That was, I mean, when I look at the pictures now, I just kind of say, oh, it was Tom Cruise. Oh, okay. I didn't know it. And then it wasn't really interesting for us. Just looking at these dolls, that meant nothing to us.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2086s)

Yeah, you had no idea who they were. Yeah. I've got a really funny story about that. I got to share with you. I grew up in Cambridge and the interchange was a very small congregation called Thaxted, which was very rural. It's this village in the country and the older generation there were all farm workers, agricultural workers, and very, very unworldly, very simple folk. Some of them, in my memory, some of them didn't even have telephones. If you wanted to invite them for dinner, you'd have [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2116s) call someone else up and ask them to speak to them.

And they had a very kind of working class or rural accent. They were very different from modern brethren, if you like. But one of these, and this would have been, I don't know whether it was the early 70s or late 60s, when Elvis Presley died, one of these older brethren was working, I think at that time he was working in a small welding company in the town, and one of his non-brethren, other employees comes in and says to him, Eric, have you heard the news? Elvis Presley's dead. And and [Eric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2164s) Smith says, oh, but where was he local?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2174s)

Wow, that's hilarious. Just clueless. Yeah, in one way that's really sad.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2184s)

Yeah, it is. It is. Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah, just so secluded. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2190s)

Tina, you've been doing some intense incredible work in Sweden exposing things. Can you give a little bit of, I do, I have a bunch of pictures here that we can show up and walk us through there if you want just to help because I know Richard has posted these on Facebook., and are you, can we walk through these pictures and you can kind of give us a little in-depth look at what you've been trying to expose there in Sweden?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2214s)

Yeah, yeah, definitely. The thing is, yeah, the thing is, it's different journalists that has actually, this last articles about the school and the companies, he was actually just going to write about the school and when I met him, I was talking about all the different companies and he said, really, what's, what's this? What, what, what, how, tell me more about these companies. So I did and then he wrote a big article about [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2244s). He said, this is really interesting. Yeah, so we'll go through it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2247s)

And Richard has posted both articles on on Facebook, on the exclusive brethren page. So we're just going to go through some of the pictures here so that she can kind of let us know this is part of the article.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2262s)

Yeah and this is a school in Sweden, I haven't seen it myself, but this is apparently the OneSchool Global that they use.

Um, and this one, yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2274s)

Wow, that looks so nice. I'm being very sarcastic to the listeners like,they're billionaires, why don't they have nice buildings?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2284s)

Exactly. I think that's, that's, that's a really old picture, I think. Yeah., this is, this is that, yeah, we can just move on.

Moving on. Yeah, and this is, she's the Swedish school inspectorate.

And this is interesting because they've been there, they inspect the schools, more or less, I don't know how often they do it, but the OneSchool Global has had a lot of complaints. But somehow they seem to be, they seem to think that they are okay anyway and it's okay for them to keep going with the schools. But now after these two last articles something is [happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2332s) and they have been aware, these school inspectors. And things are happening and we have changed the government in Sweden also. So I want to just attend, I want to meet them really. I have connections there also. So that would probably be my next step.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2358s)

And if I remember correctly, a big part of it has to do with the sex education inside the schools that keeps on being missed out, right?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2366s)

Yep. It's not only the sex education, it's the education about different religions. They are not allowed to say that the Darwin, yeah, they have to say that evolution, yeah, evolution, yeah, exactly, evolution theory, they're not allowed to talk about that.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2383s)

Which should be a crime, which should be a crime.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2387s)

Yeah, yes. And yeah, there's a lot of things and then the things that that they're not allowed to read these books that that they should read. They're not allowed just to look on the internet with everything that they should be able to do. And the teachers that are there, they are not, they are not educated teachers of course, a lot of them. And they also have to sign when they start, when they work there, they have to [sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2417s) a NDA that says that they are not allowed to talk about anything after and if they do, they could be sued.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2426s)

Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2427s)

And that's not according to Swedish regulations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2433s)

That's right. And like if that happens here too, most all of the teachers and principals have landed on my inbox. Every single one of them have had to sign an NDA and can't talk.

Like what is so hidden within the school system that you're going to bind your teachers and principles to NDAs. 

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2449s)

Yeah, I would even question the legality of some of these NDAs though.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2454s)

I would say that too. And the thing is, in Sweden we have, if somebody sees that a child is, or say abused or doesn't feel well or is something, we have to report it to the social. Yeah. And how should they do that if they signed the NDA?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2477s)

But it's failure to educate, maybe, you know, it's what it could be. It's failure to educate a child properly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2484s)

I mean, the thing that strikes me most about what's been coming up, I mean, you can understand a conservative Christian religion having difficulty with same sex marriage. I mean, not saying they should, but you can understand mentally that that would be a problem for them. But the thing that shocks me is that they're still reluctant to discuss women's rights. I mean, that's kind of medieval.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2515s)

Exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA5zORshjsG4%26t%3D2516s)

And this has come up in Canada as well as now in Sweden, that they continue to suppress women's rights. I mean, that's really shocking. I mean, how many churches, even very conservative churches, would still not recognize the equality of women?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2537s)

Even very conservative churches allow interracial marriages for crying out loud.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2543s)

Yes, yes.

And women's rights is a big thing here in Sweden. Everything is really about women's rights and our feminists and our rights to do everything. And equal pay and everything. And having a church that does like this is not very, that's not, it's not okay.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2564s)

So do you think these people from the Ministry of Education for lack of a better term are going to investigate the schools now?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2572s)

I think they already have. Yeah, it sounds, it's very intense. I'm just bringing up the article here.

Um, it's the, I mean, I highly, highly recommend to everybody to read the article because there is so much in it. Here it talks about the Plymouth Brethren are run by men;

“ Our review of the Swedish school now shows how the movement's brothers control details of children's education and how the business has been able to continue despite years of recurrent criticism, the movement has been repeatedly criticized for the subordinate position of women, the isolation of children and [breakup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2612s) families are referring to the actual PBCC cult itself.”

“Evidence from the agency's audit shows alarming data on how the school board prominent businessmen and brothers from the movement control education in detail, particularly involved are issues related to sex, equality, and feminism, according to transcripts of conversations with students and staff from the authorities documentation, for example, one teacher talks about how teaching about feminism homosexuality is described as sensitive to bring up and that the secondary school had not received any teaching on the subject of sex and cohabitation. It's sensitive to [teach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2649s) about this, says one teacher in the minutes. Staff also talk about how fiction books are screened out if they contain religious elements, different family constellations, romantic or sexual elements, the pupils themselves say in interviews with the inspectorate that the school is fantastic, fantastic, but it appears that pupils have not received training in for example, relationships, puberty and gender roles. We haven't talked about that, says one pupil. When asked if a pupil knows about gender equality, he replies, we haven't talked about those [issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2679s) at school.”

And you're going to hear a Cheryl rant coming on. This is what just, I'm sorry, Richard, I said I wasn't going to do one today.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2687s)

They don't even teach them about consent.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2689s)

Like it's just so frustrating because when people ask me, okay, Cheryl, like what do you think? What do you think needs to happen in order to get control of the sexual abuse that happens in there? This is it. Females need to know that they are equal to men. Females need to know they have a voice. They need to be taught about their bodies. They need to be taught what consent is. Like it's just, I [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2719s) so...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2719s)

And if they, Cheryl, sorry to interrupt you, but if they need a goal post on what equality would look like inside the Plymouth Brethren, I'll spell it out very clearly for them. The day a woman wearing pants takes a meeting, I'll believe you.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2744s)

Oh, that is a good one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2746s)

Yeah, look, the reason they can't accept that is that if the women actually did achieve equality in the church, the whole thing would come crashing down.

All the people who are actually the the beneficiaries of the system, you know, those wealthy businessmen and the big cheeses on the front row, they would be out on their ear.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2766s)

Or if there's a female of God, not a man of God.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2771s)

Imagine if it came out that some Protestant church had all the women sitting at the back of the church.

People would freak out about that. They'd be like, what the heck? What time are we living in? The Plymouth Brethren are one of the only churches that literally has the women sit at the back.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2786s)

I'm just imagining the faces of the brethren when they finally get to heaven and discover that God's actually a woman.

Exactly. Oh shit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2801s)

I want to read this because this is what I think they're so afraid of inside there;

“ We have not been able to close schools when deficiencies that have been corrected are again found when we come back and carry out a new inspection. Legislation has now tightened which means that we now have greater possibility to close both independent and municipal schools with serious and recurring shortcomings.”

And that's honestly what I think should happen and then it'll be a domino effect across the [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2831s). Yeah, yeah. And we know it is in countries like Sweden and those places that tend to be the first ones that set this stuff off.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2840s)

Hmm, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA5zORshjsG4%26t%3D2842s)

Is that why they are so nervous right now?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2844s)

What? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2846s)

Yeah, and I mean one thing about anything to do with the brethren, it's exactly the same all around the globe. So if something's an issue in Sweden, it will be an issue in every OneSchool Global campus right around the world. So you know, Canadian government needs to be taking a really close look at this stuff because in some provinces they're actually funding these schools. And I mean, there's a very interesting article recently came out about two brethren [schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2876s), one from the USA, one from Canada, they visited the International or the Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg, and they requested in advance that certain displays in the museum be covered up, the ones relating to same-sex marriage and women's rights.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2897s)

And Richard, apparently, some of the museum staff that were asked to bring these brethren and children around the exhibits were LGBTQ themselves.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2910s)

We should try and get in touch with some of them and see what they thought of the whole thing. But I mean, this is exactly the same thing that you've been exposing in Sweden, isn't it, Tina?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2919s)

It is, yeah, it is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2920s)

And it's so ironical that they would even go to a museum of human rights. I mean, it just blows your mind.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2928s)

It does. And I think a lot of, I think that people will start to react because it's our money that... I mean, the taxpayers are paying for this. Yes. These schools, because they receive a lot of money for this. It's the millions of kroners that they receive for these schools. And that's why I want to get it [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2959s) there that people that everybody that pays tax, they are paying for this. This is what money goes to. And the same with the companies that when you go out and buy a fantastic bathtub with all the luxuries, all that money that you put down in that bathtub that goes straight to this, to the schools, it goes to the kids being, yeah, to be, yeah, brainwashed in the end. And, I mean, [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=2989s) had, I've seen one of Sweden's more, she's a celebrity and she she does the Instagrams and so on and she put out on Instagram a great black bathtub and it was so luxury and she said where and people are asking where, where's that come from? And she said the company, of one of the brethren and I was, oh, stop it. Don't do that. Not do, but she probably doesn't know. She probably doesn't know at all [what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3019s) what she's paid for, where where the money goes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3024s)

I mean this is a very interesting point because the brethren are so ridiculously wealthy that they don't need government subsidies to run their schools. They're quite capable of paying for their own schools, which kind of means it's, you know, it's a kind of a double whammy that, you know, government money should be used to help people who can't afford to get a decent education, should be used to help people who can't afford private health care. But in fact, government is pouring money, you know, squirting [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3054s) through a hose pipe at the wealthiest people in the country to enable them to psychologically abuse their children.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3061s)

Yeah, let's go into this business stuff. I just pulled up this first picture here, let's go into there's two articles. We'll attach the link into the description of the podcast, but, yeah, let's go. I mean, Richard, I know you did a lot of research on this, but if, Tina, if you want to comment a little bit more on exactly these companies so that people can be aware where you're at, do not support these people.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3087s)

Yeah, and and in the article, I think they've, they've, he's listed a couple of companies. Uh, if you take the next picture, next picture, uh, that, yeah, that is the the Rolf Skinner's company and Nordhem it is called and they sell baths and things for bathroom and luxury bath towel hangers and whatever. And these things that also sold to, kind of [building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3117s) companies and those that build new apartments and stuff like that. So I mean, yeah, it's a fantastic business of course, but I mean, uh, it's, it's well known and it's luxury and those that buy this have no idea what the money goes back to, who is behind. And I think that when I go to a shop and say I go to H\&M or whatever, I want to know what I'm [paying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3147s) for. I want to know that these clothes have not been made by children in India. And if I buy something that should be ecological, I want to know that it is, really. So if I go to buy a bath, I want to know this, this money goes back to a religion or to a cult that's not okay. Then I want, I don't want to buy that bath.It should be somehow, yeah, I think we just let them, let people know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3176s)

Yeah, I agree. And it's not like we're sitting here, we're not sitting here bashing companies for no reason. It's like we've got to be in, exactly, you've got to be invested on where your money, out of your pocket, what is it going to, who is it funding? Like, yeah, I mean, here in Canada, it's like, that's what I've said, there should be nobody in Canada supporting any PBCC companies. No, they are hiding pedophiles in there, literally hiding pedophiles in there.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3204s)

The Plymouth Brethren like to, like to be so quiet. Thank you, babe, like to be so quiet and hide, right? What it's like if you're the one true church and you're chosen by God to be on this special mission, then you should be advertising that your businesses are connected to the Plymouth Brethren. Please do that for us. Please let everybody know that you're part of the Plymouth Brethren and we'll gladly take our business elsewhere.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3228s)

Yeah. And this is in Gothenburg where a lot of them have moved out to the most expensive place in Gothenburg. They have these great villas there.

Yeah. Millions of kroners. But they seem to have the money. So they just go and, yeah, they probably take over the whole area. And this is their meeting room in Gothenburg, I think. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3255s)

And I'm understanding their compound.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3256s)

It looks like a compound.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3258s)

Yeah, yeah. They are looking to building a bigger one, right? Is that the, yeah, yeah. Like look, I want to show people how, yeah, it is. It's and these get locked while they're in church.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3271s)

I can't help but looking at some of these brethren meeting rooms now or compounds with the gates and everything. And someone was talking a while about what does Bruce Hales have in mind for the future and everything with all the money stocking away? And I can't help but thinking one day he envisions them all living in one country in a massive compound where he can go in front of 5,000 followers because that's all that'll be left, you know, but look at how, like to the listeners, there's, there's high wire fences now [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3302s) automatic gates, gray buildings with zero windows. You know, these don't look like happy places.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3310s)

No, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3312s)

Really doesn't. And this is a gentleman that is referred to in the article where he is completely against the bigger building here.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3324s)

Yeah, yeah. I think there were a lot of them that were against them having the first building there.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3332s)

So the locals are fighting back against it?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3335s)

Yeah, they didn't want to have them there at all. They didn't want to have their businesses or they didn't want to have their meeting rooms. But then some of them say that, well, they're quiet, they keep to themselves and so on, but we don't like the way they look at women or the way they treat women. So yeah, so no, they're not too popular.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3356s)

You know, I want to, I want to switch back to the whole school thing again in back into this article because I like giving a little bit of rebuttal to their remarks that they give, they give news articles and journalists because it's so crazy. So after contacting the movements top management in Australia, the Man of God himself, an anonymous written comment from the school.

“We have welcomed the areas for improvement highlighted during school inspectorates process and are addressing them in a way that the inspectorate is, inspection is satisfied with.”

 So my comment to that is, once I see that you're teaching sex education in there and women's rights and teaching them that they have a voice just as much as they have the man, that's when I'll agree that you have stepped up your game. Regarding the restriction of people's computers, the school rights, we are protecting pupils and staff online from among [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3410s) things, illegal or harmful content. Yet they make their own content inside that is much, much, much, much more harmful to the children.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3418s)

But really, they are protecting adults, is that, I mean, I mean, people can think for themselves. I mean, yeah, that makes me really, really, that triggers me really much.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3432s)

And they're so, they're so sneaky with how they respond to journalists, right? It's not true at all. On the board's detailed management, like other similar schools, we have a board that has the usual responsibility, including the recruitment of the headmaster and corporate governance, insurance and ensuring that the school meets the requirements listed in the curricula, which we know 100% they do not follow, like they don't teach the curriculum the same way as everybody else does.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3461s)

Another point where they're very dishonest in their rebuttal in those Swedish articles is they claim that the church has nothing to do with the brethren's businesses. Now, just last night, I looked up again and there's UBT recruiting for someone in the UK. And it's on one of these recruitment websites and the the blah from UBT, the big sort of script about themselves states that all of [UBT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3491s) customers are businesses owned by members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and it states that the UBT is owned by the PBCC. This is a complete and direct opposite of what they solemnly swear to journalists. I mean, it's not just a lie. It's a great big stinking honking lie.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3516s)

Do they think that we're stupid? I mean, yes, but do they think we're stupid out here that we don't understand and can see right through what they're trying to do? I mean, yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3527s)

When you're chosen by the creator of the entire universe to be on a special mission, it seems that you get this free card to, I can lie because I'm on a special mission from God. Right? Like they think that they can just completely bullshit. Oh, these people won't even, they won't understand us because we're so special that they, no, we're blatantly calling you out on your bullshit.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3554s)

I just want to give a little kind of advance notice, a kind of a watch this space here, about something else I discovered last night.

One of the directors of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church Limited, which is kind of the UK official entity of the PBCC, is a guy called Gary Critchley. And I found online, or rather actually Damien Hastie pointed it out to me, a very interesting court case in which Gary Critchley repeatedly lies and submits kind of forged documents and all kinds of bullshit [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3594s) try and save some money in a case where he was being sued for patent infringement. And the judge just calls him out on it. He says, you know, I don't believe this. I can't accept this. This isn't true. And I'm going to write an article all about it. But, you know, after this court case goes down, the brethren choose to make this guy a director of the church as a whole. So when the church directors are sort of publicly blatant liars who will lie under oath in a court case, what hope is there for the rest of them?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3629s)

Wow\! I mean, it's going to come crumbling down and the lies will take them there. Right. That's, you know, one of the things is when I came forward with the truth with what happened with me was I knew that if I, I literally, you put the truth out there, it will gain momentum, which it did. But when you put lies out there, right, it falls apart.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3651s)

Yeah, I always say when you question a lie, it diminishes and starts to crumble, but when you question the truth, it grows stronger and larger.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3661s)

And that's the...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3661s)

You might say, well, there's just a tiny handful of us and they've got all this vast wealth and so many members, but we have the supreme advantage that all we need to do is tell the truth.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA5zORshjsG4%26t%3D3672s)

Exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DA5zORshjsG4%26t%3D3674s)

And the only weapon they've got is to tell lies.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3678s)

Yeah. And I mean, anybody who can see through the articles and know what's going on knows it's all lies and when they do their response.

Yeah. So this is a good quote from you, when you go and buy these products, it's pumped back into the cult schools.

Okay, I'm gonna let Tina comment on this article that was put out.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3701s)

Yeah, I think this is an old article.

That was this young man, he left, must be about five years ago, I think, he was from Gothenburg. And he talked a bit in the beginning but now he has a family and he just wants to be, yeah, anonymous and just, he won't talk anymore, which I understand. He has his family, brothers and sisters and mother and father back in, still in the Plymouth Brethren, so he's moved on and he, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3734s) I think he's like, like I was also, I, I didn't want to talk about it. I just want to kind of, yeah, I want to live my life. He wants to live his free life right now and not be reminded about everything.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3746s)

Right, good for him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3749s)

Exactly. And I mean, when I left, I mean, I went 26 years without talking about anything because you need that. You need to be able to walk away and take as much time as you possibly need to recoup yourself to the point where you get strong enough, where you're able to come back out after and then fight the fight.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3769s)

Yeah, and you have to be in the right place to be able to talk about it and stuff too. And, sorry, go on, go on Tina.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3777s)

Yeah, but I was going to say that things are extremely different now in the brethren than it was when I left. And uh, that annoys me of course, that they have computers and that was one why we had, we left because we weren't allowed that. And they have a lot of things that they have nowadays, mobile telephones, everything that we were not allowed to have. It was really, really, yeah, terrible that we were working with those stuff. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3808s) have it now. 

So as I've read that it seems that everybody turns a corner all the time and just when it suits them. So yeah, but somehow I feel it's great for the people inside that they are allowed. It opens up a little bit more for them to actually see the world and get out. But I am really, really, because when [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3838s) hear about all the stories that you've had and everything, I was kind of, I lived in a perfect world there. Nothing happened. I mean, not that I knew about anyway, with the sexual assault or anything. That was, I didn't even think about it. Never ever thought that it could happen, or if it did happen.

Yeah, so I'm kind of shocked of hearing about everything that has actually happened to a lot of you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3869s)

Yeah. And, you know, I'm glad that they changed things inside there too. The thing is, is that as Bruce did that, I think he tightened the chain around their necks a little bit more. The one thing that's going to blow back at him is he's given them all access. I mean, even though it is monitored, right? Everything, I mean, they're tracked, everything's monitored. But I mean, so many of them have other devices where they now watch everything [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3899s) they can on these other devices. Right. And so I'm glad that Bruce did that because it did. It opened up them to be able to have access to what we are doing now.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3910s)

Yeah. But anyway, they don't do anything about it. I mean, they're too brainwashed to dare to kind of say, no, I'm going to leave. I mean, seeing we are the family in Sweden that has actually left, there's nobody left after us. It's kind of, what? I've seen 500 people here in Sweden. What's so fantastic here? I don't understand.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3938s)

I hope this story inspires other people around the world though, right? Because I've got emails coming in from families, right, wanting, wanting to be able to take their business with them when they go is the main thing, right? And so I just hope by listening how you guys were able to get up and leave gives them ideas and plants a seed that it is possible.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=3962s)

It is possible and it made us strong as a family. It made us really, really strong as a family.

That we did it, all of us together, we were all in on it. And of course, the day after, I think it was the day after we called and said that we're not going to come to meeting and we're not going to come anymore. And that was kind of a shock for them. And then they came on the Tuesday, of course, to speak to us and see if we were really kind of, are you sure? And they wanted to speak us to us separately and I think we all said the same thing, we're done, we're fine, you don't need to [visit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4000s) us anymore.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4001s)

And they were kind of amazed.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4003s)

What? Yeah, and they was kind of, haven't you felt the the presence of Jesus in Sunday mornings? And I'm kind of, no, sorry, I haven't.

I don't know. So they were shocked about that. And I said, you don't need to visit me no more. And they didn't. They respected it because I thought they realized we're done. There was no use in visiting us anymore.

So that was it. Since then, I haven't even spoken to anybody on them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4038s)

So what do you think? What do you think their reaction is with you being so vocal?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4044s)

No, I think that first of all, I think that in the beginning, I think that whatever she can talk, whatever, it doesn't matter. But I think that now seeing it, I actually, it keeps on coming all the time and I'm not the one instigating it. It's the journalists that are doing it. They are interested. There's a lot of people interested and the public is interested.

So I think that now it's giving effect, especially with the school. And now that if they're going to dig into the business parts, I don't know, but I'm prepared for whatever is going to come my way. I have a lot of support. I have a lot of big men in my life. So I know a lot of all these Hells Angels and all of them. I'm just kidding.

So, uh, yeah, but as what's it you that told me, Cheryl, that this article made an impact?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4112s)

Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. I can't reveal a whole bunch of stuff, but yeah. Yeah, absolutely it has, it has made an impact. And once we get more confirmation of what's going on, then we can release that information. Yes, it very much has made an impact in there. Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4128s)

I told the journalist, I spoke to him and I said that I really liked the article and it's given an impact and he was kind of, really?

Yeah, and he said in Sweden, I said internationally. And I thought he was kind of, whoops.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4146s)

The thing is the article is so well written. He didn't hold back. He didn't sugarcoat anything. It literally was this black and white written article that says it just like it is. He called a spade a spade, right? He just, it was an incredibly written article. Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4159s)

Yeah, it was very good. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4161s)

Yeah, it is good.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4162s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4163s)

Well, thank you so much, Tina, for coming on and sharing your adventures with us, we knew when you found those articles and yeah, we definitely, I was grateful for Richard tracking you down and you on here. Yeah, yeah, he's a, he's a good, he's a good a good investigator.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4184s)

I mean, actually all I do, no big secret. Every day I just go to Google and I put Plymouth Brethren in inverted commas, searching the whole term, and then I set it to on the tools, the past 24 hours and it just pulls up every single thing that's been published on the internet about the Plymouth Brethren that day. And then I, something, something made me wonder about other countries. So I went to Google Translate, translated Plymouth Brethren into [Swedish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4214s) and popped that in, and wow, my screen just filled up.

And I thought, gracious me, someone has been mighty busy in Sweden. And yeah, I was blown away.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4226s)

You can Google my name and you'll find a lot.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4229s)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All the articles, I mean, I'm not, my Swedish is a bit rusty, but I recognize this word Tina kept popping up in all the articles. So, you know.

[**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4243s)

I imagine in some ways it's been a lonely journey because, you know, just being the one person speaking out, you know, the whole of Scandinavia is, yeah, but I mean, it's, it's phenomenal and…

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4259s)

And unfortunately my family don't really approve and I would say my, not my closest, this family, but my siblings and mother, they don't like it, so it is a really lonely journey because I don't tell them anything. I don't tell them about this. I haven't told them about this. I haven't told them about anything because they don't want to know, which leaves me alone. I can't discuss it with them at all. So I'm thankful to be able to discuss it with you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4296s)

You can contact us and be a part of our investigative team if you want.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4305s)

And our representative in Sweden, Ms. Tina Nystrom, will be speaking on…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4315s)

We can make you a LinkedIn profile and get you a UBT account. Definitely. It doesn't pay though. I unfortunately had to tell you it doesn't pay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4330s)

Although some brethren members are convinced we're getting paid. I really wish we were.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4337s)

If I go out and buy a $7.5 million mansion with cash, then you know I got paid. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4346s)

But our reward is something else, isn't it? Yeah. Our reward is something else that we see. 100% it is.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4352s)

Experiencing life. Yeah. I wanted to do a quick rant to the members inside just before we close. About something that they take very preciously. It's the most precious event in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and it's the Lord's Supper, right? They do it Sunday morning at 6 a.m. And they literally worship this event. It is meant to be probably the most special event in the entire world.

So my challenge to people that are inside the Brethren, next time you go to the Lord's Supper, I want you to compare how you feel to how you feel listening to a song, one of your favorite music songs, or how you feel having sex with your partner, or how you feel eating your favorite food. And if any of those feelings felt better than eating dry bread and sipping on wine at six o'clock in the morning, then you know that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4409s) Lord's Supper is not the best thing in the entire world.

Sex is better. Way better.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4427s)

Going back, if I just may say, going back to the Lord's Supper, I mean, when I was a kid, I had a lot of thoughts about that. I was scared. I was thinking, when is it going to happen? How will it happen? How will he come? Because that's was when Jesus was going to come. Yeah, will he take, would he only, what about he takes mom and dad and not me? Yeah, am I going to be left out? And and what's going to happen? Are our clothes just going to be lying here [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4458s) nothing else? I mean, in a child's mind that grows big and it it get you, I got excited and anxiety.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4467s)

Anxiety, yeah, yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4469s)

Yeah, I got that because of that because I was thinking of what in school when I'm not there on Monday, what what what will they think and they come to this home and there's just a lot of clothes. I mean, nobody explains what's going to happen and how is it going to happen when you come through the door or the window.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4489s)

It was such a serious event too, very solemn and serious. But if it was, if it was actually a really great event, you would walk out of the Lord's Supper being like, what did Jesus begin?

Right? Like you'd be happy.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4505s)

Everyone walks out like, oh, I'm tired. It's so fear-based. I'll crawl back into bed. I mean, the thing that really strikes me about the Brethren and the Supper is this, that we're all told that you should get to the supper like 15 minutes early because the Lord is coming and it would be disrespectful to the Lord to arrive late. And so, I mean, this was, you know, not long before I left the brethren this was kind of a new thing. You actually turn up quarter to six for the supper, not six o'clock. But [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4535s) you go to a fellowship meeting with Bruce Hales, you have to be sitting down two hours in advance. So that gives you a sense of the relative importance to the brethren of Jesus and Bruce Hales. Jesus, 15 minutes early. Bruce Hales, two hours early. So yeah, just something else for your people inside to have a little chew over, I'm really looking forward to your to your rebuttal.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4562s)

And it's interesting because we're different time zones also. I couldn't understand that. I mean, when it's six o'clock in Sweden, it's not six o'clock everywhere.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4576s)

Yeah, I mean, yeah.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4577s)

So when, oh yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4580s)

Yeah, the supper's staged like at different times all across. So who would go first? I remember thinking that as a child, like who were the first ones to go?

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4589s)

Yeah, because it's happening, yeah, yeah, yeah. We start with Australia, but we know because, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I thought nobody would know that. Nobody knows.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4601s)

Even after I left, I remember, you know, I left when I was 18 years old, but even for a year or two after, I remember having just slight residual fear that like if the rapture did come and all the brethren disappeared, like, you know, I would freak out and you know, I had this little fear, right? Takes a while to get over it.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4622s)

It is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4626s)

Wow. Well, I guess we should maybe wrap it up there and, Tina, you are welcome. You can join our team. We would be more than grateful to have you on. You've got that feisty, fiery spirit that the rest of us do.

And a good sense of humor.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4650s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4652s)

Thanks to my father, British.

### [**Tina Nystrom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4655s)

Yeah, but when I look at you, I mean, everybody's colorful and happy and so on. We don't have gray skin. Yeah, we have gray skin, gray hair. I have gray hair.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4677s)

You watch Richard, it's gonna come back. No, I thought she said great hair.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5zORshjsG4&t=4687s)

And then we'll attach the links in the description that we spoke of today. I really, really think it's super important for everybody to read the whole articles. Yes, they're long articles, but it's really important that you read them.

Thank you so much, Tina, for joining us today. We're so grateful you had you on.

Okay. Until next time, everyone. Much love to everybody.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
