## Summary

Religious communities must embrace diversity and support LGBTQIA+ individuals. The impact of discrimination on mental health is too great to ignore. Our anonymous guest from Canada takes us on her journey to finding her freedom and support outside the toxic culture of the PBCC. Craig and Ben join in our discussion of their shared experiences, leaving the PBCC due to the unaccepting views on anyone associated in this community. (Jenny) reads her letter of goodbye to her parents and we discuss the lack of education and understanding about sex and homosexuality in these communities that has led to rampant misconceptions, fixation on sexual relationships, and deep-seated guilt and shame.
The podcast also revealed the struggles faced by teachers within these communities. They feared repercussions for speaking out against racism and homophobia, leading to a high turnover of teachers. The impact of a fear-based stance on the entire community is truly sobering.
LGBTQ+ individuals deserve acceptance and understanding, not discrimination and fear. It's time to create supportive, inclusive environments  and find ways to help them understand that you can not pray the gay away!

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=56s)

Hi everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl and with me today I have Ben Woodbury and Craig Hoyle. We also have a recent leaver joining us today from Canada who is about to bring a wealth of insight and experiences. While she prefers to remain anonymous, I guarantee you her perspective will definitely give us insight into the views on the LGBTQI community. Welcome\!

[We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=87s) are going to call her Jenny. Welcome Jenny.

Thanks for having me on. 

You're so welcome. Thank you for coming on. So I guess we'll just start off with, you recently left the PBCC. It hasn't even been a year yet, has it been a year?

It was a year just in January. Oh wow, okay. So you did have your year, congratulations. Oh yeah, I do remember that. Yes. So what prompted you to leave the PBCC? And I guess how [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=117s) you find the strength to get the courage to leave and transition into a whole new world? What was the process like for you?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=125s)

I left for a couple different reasons, the main one being that I'm a lesbian. And obviously because the way they are, my mental health was really suffering and I just knew I needed to get out. Somehow the topic of homosexuality always came up at family gatherings. It was a really popular topic for them.

No one in there knew that I was a lesbian until I came out to my parents, I believe, three years ago now, and I was told not to tell anyone, including my therapist, about it. That was about two years before I left.

My parents talked to a brother and doctor, and it was recommended that I speak with a Christian therapist who dealt with this kind of thing. I never ended up doing that, but we also didn't really talk about it again until just before I left. I had promised my dad that I would let him know before I made any big decisions, and I was really hoping that by respecting their wishes in the way that I left, they would respect mine in leaving.

I've never been super great at expressing myself in person so I just wrote a letter and emailed it to my dad the day before I left. I moved out the day after sending it and if you don't mind I'd like to share a bit of it with you.

I'd love that.

‘Dad and mom,

 I hate that I have to choose between my happiness and family and community. I understand that you may not see it that way but it is the truth. The first thing I need you to know is it wasn't an easy decision. I've thought it over long and hard, and in some ways I've always known this would have to happen. I'm sorry for the pain this will cause. I am firm in my decision, and I would appreciate if you respected that.

I'm sure it is the right place for some people. I'm not one of those people. I can't be happy living with my family and community openly proclaiming their hatred for people like me. I hope someday they realize that in doing that they're ruining any chance they have of helping people or being safe people to open up to. No matter what happens, I will never fit in. Being gay isn't a choice people make. With the challenges queer people face, no one would ever decide to be gay losing [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=267s) and friends. Yeah. I would like if you told at least our local family that I am gay. I know it's an odd request and one that you might not grant. However, I feel like it would be beneficial in the future. I've accepted the fact that I will never be at home in our family. I guess that is up to you. I believe in God and Jesus. I do sometimes struggle with reconciling the fact that God doesn't make mistakes with the fact that I am gay. I know you might argue this by saying I wasn't born gay, but I was [gay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=298s) before I was ever conscious that there was a term for it. As promised, I'm making you aware of my decision before I act on it. I'm sure you saw this coming. I will be moving out as soon as possible. I love you.”

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=312s)

Oh, that's amazing. I want to give you a big hug. That's just, you've literally summed up how I wish I could have expressed to my parents, particularly the part about it being a choice because so many people, and you still get it out here, you know, you'll see it online with people and I'm sure you come across it as well in media, Craig, where it's like, it's a lifestyle where you chose that lifestyle. No, and in particular where we've come from, nobody would choose that. I used to, not now, I want to [clarify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=342s) for anybody in there listening, I used to wish that I was straight. I used to want what my brother had in terms of the idea of a future set within the brethren.

I didn't want to lose my family and I'm sure none of us did either. So why would we choose it? And I had this conversation with my mum as well, like it's not something you choose, the heartache, the pain, the term for what, like for what, you know, we already have estranged and difficult relationships out here because we've never seen real [authentic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=373s) relationships in there. And then on top of that, we're doing that in a straight man's world. Like it's a really difficult thing to have to come to terms with. And it's taken me seven years to sit down and go, hey, I can tell you right to your face that I'm comfortable and grateful that I am gay. I couldn't change it. There's nothing you can do and you just have to be okay with it. And when you do, I think everything else sort of falls into place. But it's just the way you summed that up. I wish, you know, I could express that to my parents and such. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=403s) so respectful as well because sometimes you want to yell and scream at them because it's not, they're not understanding, they're not, they're not getting you.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=414s)

It's funny isn't it? I was just thinking it's been 15 years for me now and I thought when I was coming out as gay as a teenager and everything that I was the only one and I felt so alone. And then I realized there were so, so many of us. And I read Jenny's letter there to her parents and it could have sort of been lifted from how I felt and what I was trying to express to my parents 15 years ago in a completely different country. And there are just so many of us having these experiences. So like for any young gay kids in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=444s) brethren, like you're not alone at all.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=448s)

Yeah, and your own leader said it. He's told me that there are more in than there are that have left. So I don't know if that's changed now because we have such a big gay community out here, a thriving gay community. I'm not just talking about monetary things, like happy, peaceful people. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's just the fear, you know, and I think in particular, like one of my cousins, she's gay, like a lesbian like you. And I think it's, it's incredible for women to come [forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=478s) and come out and because it's such a, like you, you can really slip under the radar I think in there as a woman because you are already second rate, you are already suppressed. So it can be a part of, you know, your persona, you can, you can add it to, not that the men can't get away with it and don't. It's just I think it's incredibly brave because you could just go along with it. Yeah, it's hats off to you. You're, it's amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=506s)

How did your parents receive this?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=508s)

They obviously weren't very happy with my decision and begged me to give them another chance to quote unquote fix me. They said that they thought me being a lesbian wasn't an issue anymore because we hadn't talked about it over the year between when I told them and when I left, or the two years. And I guess they thought in that time I had become straight, which doesn't happen, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=539s) I guess that's what they thought. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=542s)

Very similar, same thing. Like when I first came out at 18 and then my mum, you know, realizing I was leaving, you know, when I was 24, she was like, but we thought this was fixed.

Yeah, similar. No, it's not fixable. You just bury it down, right? And most of them that are in there that are older that are gay that you know are obviously gay and bury it with things like alcohol.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=566s)

My parents were the same. They never spoke a word about it after finding out and they just left it all to the priests and pretended that it wasn't happening. Yeah, denial.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=575s)

Yeah, I didn't even have any visits with priests or anything like that. We just didn't talk about it. Occasionally my mom would be like, how's it going? And I would be like, it's, it's going, it's not going away.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=590s)

Though I don't mean to laugh at that, but.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=592s)

Okay, not that you're asking.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=595s)

Yeah, thanks for asking. It's, it's, it's I laugh in hindsight now at it, but at the time it like used to break my heart. I used to have a similar situation with my mom. I would walk down, you know, downstairs ready for church and I'd be wearing something that was slightly effeminate and it might have like, it might have been a blue shirt that had a slight paisley pattern through it. And my mom would be like, do you think, do you think you should wear that? Like, you know, it looks a bit, she couldn't say the word. I'd be like, what, what looks what? And she's like, you know, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=626s) know, they're gonna know.

Like they're paranoid because like you said, all your life you're taught and you have and And you know what you said at the start, which I thought I'd mention, that you thought that your family were the most homophobic or were homophobic vocally the most and talked about gay things and gay people the most. I believe that it's because we're hyper-aware of it, looking back, because I too, and I've heard this so many times from a lot of my gay friends that have helped leave the [Brethren,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=656s) they say the same thing. But my family were obsessed with it. That's all they talked about. I'm like, no, no, no, no. I think we're hyper aware of it. We're hyper aware of what we are going through.

 And we look and learn and glean from every little bit of conversation like sponges, trying to work out at all, if at any chance we can bring it up with who is the most lenient and therefore try and work out what we're going through. Because I did that. I didn't come out to a priest. I came out to my auntie because she had mentioned. I remember at one point in the line saying, the Lord [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=686s) forgive anything. I remember a guy that was gay once and now he's got wife and kids and to me at that time with my little understanding or knowledge was like, ah, okay, I'll speak to her about it because she, she had hope, she held that hope. So I think it's, I think we're just hyper aware of it. It might not be that your family, you know, were super interested in gay people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=709s)

Were you sent on any encouragement trips? Like, and Craig went on one. I can't remember if you went on one, Ben, but were you sent on one?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=718s)

I was sent to Canada. Were you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=722s)

Go ahead, Jen. Yeah.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=723s)

I ended up going on an encouragement trip a month later. I think my parents and possibly the priest thought that I wasn't the only person behind my decision, and keeping me away from this non-existent other person would bring me back in there. I always kept to myself and never caused a fuss. So maybe it didn't seem like I had it in me to leave on my own. So they created this non-existent human who made the decision for me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=754s)

Let's go into a bit of like, what kind of discrimination against the LGBTQI community did you witness? Like, what was it that you were witnessing?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=762s)

I have to admit, growing up, I was a bit homophobic as well. I really regret that now. We all were.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=770s)

We all were.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=771s)

Yeah, I think.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=772s)

Yeah, you defended yourself by being, trying to be the most homophobic one out there so that nobody questioned you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=778s)

And it's interesting how you can look at the most, the people that are the most vocal are usually the ones that are projecting the homophobia because they don't have to deal with what they've got.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=787s)

Yeah, I definitely think that that was just me trying to hide that I myself was a lesbian. The kids at school were very openly homophobic and didn't hesitate to talk about it. If anyone ever seemed just the slightest bit gay, they would have people talking behind their backs about it. It was usually just because a guy had a sense of fashion or was sensitive, which clearly doesn't make someone gay. But I [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=817s) like it was more the men who were targeted because as a lesbian, it's much easier to slide under the radar.

I lived across the street from a lesbian couple and some of the comments I heard about them were really, really awful.

I think cheating on your spouse was taken far more lightly than being part of the LGBTQIA+ community and to this day the term gay is used very derogatorily in there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=852s)

Yeah, it's, and that's, that's one thing I had to learn out here is that you can't just use a word like gay synonymously with the word, you know, meaning the word or crap or a negative experience connotation, you know, linked with that word. We, that was big here in Australia as well.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=873s)

Yeah, I really like that in leaving we, like you're able to reclaim words that they use derogatorily and make them your own.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=882s)

Yeah, 100%. It's so rewarding.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=885s)

Right, yeah. And I guess in the Brethren that you could never call people out on that kind of language because the second you tried to object to it, you came under suspicion for like, oh, you don't, you don't like us being homophobic, maybe you're gay.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=899s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=900s)

So there was no speaking out about anything like that. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=903s)

I do think that that behavior is learned, like it does stem from the top because if you think about it, okay, somebody cheating on their wife, which you mentioned before, it is viewed as obviously a lot less a sin than being a homosexual. So if, if the top or if the leaders or the elders or Bruce Hales knew that homosexuality wasn't a cure, that you were born with it, you are just who you are, you wouldn't be so fixated on it because and [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=933s) cheating on somebody, you know, it would, would be valued higher, like as a worse offense. So obviously there is some sort of recognition to the point that these people that us in our community can't change who we are and they do know that. They just hide it by making and highlighting it as the worst, you know, and backing up with their own Bible.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=954s)

Scriptures. Dr. Roger Kirkpatrick, I won't say may he rest in peace, but told me that being... Yeah,

Dr. Kirkpatrick told me that being gay was constitutional and it was part of the makeup of who you were. And that seemed to me to be a particularly cruel twist because like if you're admitting that it's constitutional and it's part of who you fundamentally are, then how on earth are you expecting gay people to live in the Brethren? Like you're just condemned to a life, you know, by that point they were almost admitting that you couldn't change and that your life was just completely suppressing who you were for the rest of your life and trying to make the best of a bad job.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=994s)

And you know, it reminds me of somebody who is born of color, right? That's the color of your skin. You're born that way. You can't just all of a sudden change color of your skin. To me, it's the exact same thing, right? You, you're born this way. There is no altering it, there's no changing it. This is who you are.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1015s)

People would say that it is changeable. They are only straight people. Yeah. They are only people that have never experienced it. And I keep bringing it back to, we would not have left and gone through what we went through because obviously at one point that was the, you know, foregoing reason why we left. Yes, there are a multitude of other reasons now I'd never be a part of it, but that doesn't come to light until you start questioning your own existence and who you are.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1041s)

Yeah. If any of us, like when we first started realizing we were gay and a Brethren, if someone had offered us a magic wand that we could wave and not be gay, like we would have taken it immediately. The last thing you’d want is to be a gay person.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1054s)

As a nine-year-old child, yes. How old were you, Craig, when you realized that you were fundamentally different to every other kid in the classroom?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1064s)

I knew I was different like at four or five, but I couldn't put a finger on it probably until I was 11 or 12\. Yeah, because there was no, there was no language, there was no framework. I didn't even know that there was a word for boys who like boys instead of girls.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1080s)

What was it like for you, Jenny, growing up like that? Like what was, what did you like, what were the challenges you faced?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1087s)

Growing up, I was always a tomboy. I'd like to think I was, I'm a bit more fashionable now that I can wear whatever I want, but back then I definitely stuck out like a sore thumb. Skirts and dresses just really weren't my thing and a lot of people who see pictures of me before leaving compared to now are like, oh, you looked so dead inside, which I think is a running theme for most leavers. But I didn't admit to myself until that I was a lesbian until I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1117s) about 18\. A lot of my childhood I spent trying to be straight or quote unquote normal. When the other girls started talking about who they had crushes on, I would just pick a boy at random and decide that he was my crush now, just to fit in.

**Ben Woodbury**

I can relate to that.

**Jenny**

Yeah, I think most people can, at least most LGBTQIA+ people can.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1145s)

How old were you roughly when you realized that you were?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1148s)

I think like I knew that I was different around about eight, but I didn't really have a term for it like Craig said it until about 11 or 12\.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1159s)

Yeah, no, very similar than all of us and everyone I speak to and I've helped believe this is the same thing. Although there are some girls that have left, like lesbians, that took them a lot longer to realize why they just didn't like being with men.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1175s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1176s)

I think because the women are kept so much more sheltered and and don't have access to the outward outside world in the way that men do. Yeah, you can go to work after school, but then you're usually married off. And and I think it's more intimidating to speak to men because out in the outside world or make friends because you've been so suppressed.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1196s)

Do you think, do you think part of it as well is that the Brethren just by and large don't see women as sexual beings the way they see men? I think of all of the, you know, the Brethren spinsters, that's a terrible word, but like the spinster woman, it was quite, quite acceptable for two single Brethren women to live together as they got older. But if two single Brethren men had done the same thing, like everyone would have assumed they were gay.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1224s)

Oh, 100%. They would never have been allowed to. But the interesting thing is though, I actually do wonder if there's, because that it suddenly reminds me of spinster women living together, unmarried elderly women living together. I'm like, they've got this system sorted. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1239s)

Like how many of, how many of them were secretly coupled up though? You do wonder looking back.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1243s)

Yeah, yeah. This is why we say that women are smarter than men.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1253s)

Jenny, were you ever afraid that if you stayed in there you would end up being married off whether you liked it or not?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1259s)

Not really. A lot of women in our locality were single until older ages, but yeah, it wasn't, it was something I got bugged about a fair bit, like, oh, when are you gonna get married? Who are you getting married to? Don't go visit places because you know, you might pick up a guy while you're there and then you'll have to move. And it was always joked about, but I don't think there was as much pressure as there probably was on men.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1286s)

One of the leaders used to say that, right? Like it's not important for women to get married, but for men it is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1292s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1294s)

So yeah, cool.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1296s)

For you, Jenny, like what was it like going to school in this, in this, being a lesbian and not being able to.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1305s)

I don't know how old you are. So did you go to both high school and primary school in the breathren?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1310s)

Yeah, they started grade three and up when I was in grade four. So I went from grade four on.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1318s)

Okay.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1319s)

I never really had a ton of front friends in there because I didn't fit in in any way really with anyone my age. So I mostly just had people in my class that I hung out with. It was like I had different people who I would share different parts of me with. I guess I was kind of afraid that if everyone or if anyone knew the whole me, then they would probably figure out that I was a lesbian. So I just kind of had to separate things a bit.

But I remember the locker rooms being a really scary place for me. I always felt like I was a creep and felt so dirty going in there. I would just like stay facing away from everyone.

And I guess it was just because it's so ingrained in you that gays are terrible, perverted people. And at that point, I still believed that. So whenever possible, I would go to the washrooms and change in the stalls in there.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1378s)

Did the other kids notice that?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1381s)

Not really. There were a few girls who would do that. So it was a bit easier to blend in. But yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1386s)

I was the same. And this is such a weird thing to say. I don't know if you have experienced this, Craig. But I was the same. I would never use a urinal because I was terrified that my gay would trigger out and I'd become one of the perverted gays when I was trying to hide it and suppress it. And so to this day, I really struggle to use one because I think I had this fear built up and you know that if you don't relax, you can't go to the toilet. So you're standing there for half an hour. But [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1416s) I, the same growing up, I would always go and even changing after sports, the same thing. I was terrified of being even just accidentally looking that way and being told you're gay and then everybody knows, you know, it's the fear.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1430s)

Yeah, I can't remember whether this was before I graduated or like one time when I went back to visit, but they have this block called collaboration. At least that's what it was called when I was there. I'm not sure what it's called now, but we do random activities and crafts, team building stuff.

And one day the activity was to trace out your hand and then in each finger you'd write things you stood against. And I think about 50% of the students wrote something to do with the LGBT community, whether it was like gay or trans or the LGBT. And I guess because of the pressure on the teachers in there, they just put them up anyway. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1471s)

Yeah. Oh, that breaks my heart. That absolutely breaks my soul inside to know that they're teaching these kids that. Oh.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1481s)

But this is what I mean. It's I…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1483s)

Catch my breath.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1484s)

Learned behavior from parents, from who learned from the community, from the leaders, from the elders, from Bruce Hales. You know, they're all responsible and they all need to be held accountable. These are children learning hate, Christian children learning hate.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1499s)

Yeah, and he had the non-brethren teachers deal with stuff like that.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1504s)

Right, yeah. I'm not sure about other campuses, but I know lots of the teachers at our campus were afraid to speak out about things for fear of getting fired. So they kind of just had to keep their opinions to themselves and go through it. I think that's why we had a really high turnover in teachers. I think during the time I was there, there was about 31 teachers that went through the system.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1527s)

That's incredible. And every school is the same. Sydney, Australia, highest turnover of teachers growing, but when I went to Kellyville, the MET school and the Sydney school at the same time back then when it's called MET, the same thing. Every…teachers would just disappear. Either they spoke up or they would find out that they were, you know, same-sex marriage, like a partner at home, or they weren't, they didn't agree fully with the school ethos, they were disappeared.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1557s)

I had a recent teacher reach out to me. I'm not gonna reveal who it was. I and I just went in here just to read what she had read about the LGBTQ community. This is, it's really long. I'm not gonna read everything. I'll read this out and put it on a video at a later date, but she goes into;

“If staff are too vocal, they can be let go, especially if it's questioning how the school is run. They've had several incredible teachers dismissed if they started questioning things about the school and community. It was unfortunate [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1587s) the students really adored many of those teachers. They also do not hire anyone who has shown any support for the LGBTQ community. I was once part of a hiring committee and had chosen a candidate I felt was more than qualified for the role, but was told to choose a different candidate. My chosen candidate had been a part of several LGBTQ movements listed on a resume and I believe this to be the reason the community advised against her.”

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1613s)

100% would have been. Yeah, they're terrified. I've been contacted by so many teachers, including some who are still teaching at the Brethren schools and they're like over and over again, like their biggest concern is how racist and homophobic the Brethren are and how there's no opportunity for the teachers to address that and they're just really concerned about how the schools are operating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1634s)

And it's hard for them to come forward. Like I mean, you think it's between everybody, the amount of teachers that have come forward and yet it's, it is, it's hard. It's so hard for them to show their face, do a podcast and and reveal what they know because they've seen what happens when, when they stand up against them. That is just like absolutely, it's so hypocritical when they don't, when they're, they're in that kind of a fear-based stance to, I had somebody message me that their family was completely ripped apart due to, it was her husband who stood up to them. Like it's just, it's heartbreaking. It's just heartbreaking. [Jenny,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1680s) in your opinion, why do you think the PBCC is so homophobic when they, like they've evolved so much in many other sectors? They've evolved in in electronics that there's, they have, there is many avenues where they have allowed evolution to happen. Why do you think that this community and this cult doesn't evolve in this sector when it's so apparent in the real world that, I mean, there's LGBTQ everywhere?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1708s)

I think they've got to maintain this idea of sin, which obviously has to be one of the ones that nobody in there is committing openly.

So homosexuality is an easy target for them, especially right now with how things are going in the States and fights in the public school system in Canada. It also happens to be something that comes up a couple times in the Bible. Though I would say that there's been research that suggests the way it's mentioned in the Bible is not a consensual relationship between two adults, but I feel like, yeah, they've got to maintain this idea of sin and [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1750s) just an easy target.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1751s)

You think part of it is also that, I mean, Brethren are obsessed over anything to do with sex or sexuality and you know, it was like, yeah, definitely, definitely.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1764s)

As part of it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1764s)

If you ever really wanted to get a group of Brethren going, you started talking about sex. And I think also in the Brethren, like they couldn't dissociate being gay from having gay sex. Yeah, yeah. Therefore, if you, if you said I'm gay or I'm lesbian or whatever, their immediate thought was gay sex, gay sex, gay sex. And it's like, yeah, there's so much more to queer people than the sex they may or may not be having. And there are people who come out as gay and then choose not to have sex, but that's like the one small part of their lives that the Brethren obsess over.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1801s)

Yeah, it's so true. When I mentioned to my parents that I had a girlfriend, one of the first questions I was asked is, oh, so have you slept with her yet? Which kind of shows where their mind goes on that one. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1818s)

It's so true though. I remember having a conversation with my mom about it. Like I was like, if I didn't have sex, would I still be gay? If I only prefer the company of men like as a partner or like what, what part of me, the gay part makes are gay? Is it the sex? And she's like, yeah, like, well, it's so I abstain from sex, am I still gay?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1840s)

My brother who came out eight years after me, back when was still, he was still talking to my parents, he had quite a vigorous argument with my mother about gay people because he had started to get to know me and realized that I wasn't as bad as I'd all believed. But she, my mom said to him that what she just couldn't get her head around with how disgusting it was to think about two men having sex. And he said to her, well, the thing is, if you look around all of the heterosexual couples in the brethren and it's just as disgusting [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1872s) think about a lot of them having sex. Like it's just weird to imagine people you know having sex full stop. Yeah, yeah, right.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1880s)

Yeah, after, after the conversation about whether or not I was sleeping with this girl, I was told, oh, so then you're basically just like best friends then, right? I was like, not, not quite, no.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1896s)

They, they still have that level of denial though. Like I remember seeing my dad after one of them, only two times I've seen him after. And I think I was, it was like not long after I'd left and I ended up in hospital and he turned up. I don't know how or what happened or how he knew I was there. I think I must have told my mom I was going for some surgery. And anyway, he showed up and my best friend had left and she, you know, [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1926s) a partner, I think, and a couple kids. And the first thing, I was just like sort of coming out of recovery because she was there with me, he was like, that woman that just left, is your relationship with her pure? I need to know. And I was like, where am I? Is this hell?

So my dad then, I was like, a woman, what do you mean? He's like, is it pure? Is your relationship with her pure? I said, she's my best friend. And he's like, yes, so is it pure? And I was like, what do you mean? And I obviously knew, I just wanted him to say, are you having sex with this woman? So no, dad, she's got a partner and two kids.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1964s)

They are so fixated though on sexual relationships, right? It's, it is just because it's such a taboo thing in there. Nothing is taught about it. Nothing is ever, it's just, it's such, it's in the closet, whether it's male, female, there's nothing, right? No.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1983s)

Education about it, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1984s)

That their minds immediately go there, right? It just, they immediately go there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=1989s)

And more importantly, yeah, what you just said, Craig, that's a really important point. There's no, no teaching or education around consent. The difference is is with gay sex or gay relationships, it's two consenting adults. You've got somebody in there raping a child, well, the Lord can forgive him and you have to as well. But the two consenting adults, they're bound for hell. It, how is that logical? How does that at all [stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2019s) up and make sense? And this is the thing I've used to try and point out with my own parents is that it's, it's consenting people. It's not, I mean, obviously the argument's lost on them. They never, never want to hear it anyway because they'll only believe what they know and they don't know that a whole lot, you know, it's the education of it, right? You're not educated about it, you don't know.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2040s)

Yeah, and that's all, it's all about control, isn't it? Like, you know, yeah, one of their teachings and one of the things that's been said is you need to keep yourself pure for at least six months before you get married, which means no masturbation. And then you have all these young kids who are like raging messes of hormones who are trying not to masturbate for six months and failing and feeling like it's some kind of moral shortcoming. And then you're going to go to the priests about it and it's just [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2071s) plowed up with all of that guilt and shame and control. And it gives the priests an opportunity to come in and just fuck with your head a bit.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2083s)

Yeah, no, I remember confessing about masturbation and then having a real conflict because one day I used to have CDs, right? And my dad would always go through my bedroom routinely every second day and I'd know because I'd set like little booby traps to find out. And also the CDs would be missing. So one day I thought, I'm just gonna go find them. I just put them here an hour ago. So they're in his bedroom. So while he was in the shower, went through his room, I couldn't find them. But the interesting thing I [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2113s) find, which is really unusual, in his second draw was condoms. 

And to me, it was like, this is so sinful. Like and I spoke to my priest at the time about it. I was like, you know what? I'm getting you in trouble for once. And I told him and I said, oh, interesting. Like because he said, oh, your father told me he's going to say this again. I'm like, interesting. I went look for them and found condoms. And there was this whole conflict of like, he had to explain to me that, well, they are wrong because it's, you know, you're essentially stopping a life. It's a contraceptive. And in the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2143s) notion, he was like, I can't speak, it's his matter. I'm, you know, he was younger than my dad. It was a lot of awkward gray area. It's just, if this doesn't make sense at all, none of this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2154s)

You said you didn't have priestly visits, did you?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2157s)

No, I have not had any. I haven't been shut up or anything like that yet either. It's been a year, so I'm not sure what's going on there, but.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2167s)

That would be the first database for Jenny to shut her up. We have a Jenny, Jenny, Jenny from.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2176s)

Canada.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2176s)

We have a Jenny from Sydney.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2180s)

867-5309, here's her number. I get that, but yeah.

[Those that are my age will get it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny)

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2192s)

Jenny, did you ever like, how did you learn about your sexuality? How did you learn, like obviously you grew up in their schools, like I did. I used to go to a local library and I used to ring a sex worker. How did you discover more about who you were? Like who did, who did you speak to? Like you had to have someone. I know you said you had a therapist, but were they Brethren and you weren't, wanted to talk to them about that or?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2217s)

They were not Brethren, but I wasn't actually able to talk to them about it until I think it was a year before I left, maybe a bit less. I finally realized that I wanted to do therapy for myself and that was something I obviously needed to talk about. So I broke their number one rule and told my therapist that I was a lesbian. But the around here, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2247s) a lot of, especially when I was younger, there was a lot of protesting for and against the, I think it's sexual orientation and gender identity in school systems.

And there was a lot of protests around that and a few of the Brethren were involved in that and that was something that kind of made me aware of what the terms might be. And then of course I was on Google quite often saying, what, why am I attracted to women? Stuff like that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2282s)

Like your home computer or you did you have to go like elsewhere to find that or?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2286s)

I had a phone quite young. It had parental controls on it, but I often found ways to get around those because you do that when you get desperate.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2298s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2300s)

I used to steal my neighbor's newspaper. So yes, that's such a toxic way to find out you're gay in the context of like the brethren hating on it. It's the same thing for me, like when the civil union legislation was going through in New Zealand and the Brethren were holding prayer meetings about it and talking about how wicked it was. So that was my first realization that the gay community even existed.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2320s)

Yeah, I remember a guy getting kicked out of the church and that was when I realized, oh wait, there are, I'm not the only one in here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2331s)

How have you found it since leaving, Jenny? Like how have you found it with integrating into the outside world and like have you had a lot of support?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2339s)

Yeah, I definitely wouldn't be where I am today without therapy. That's been a huge lifesaver and really helped with my transition from being in the PBCC to being where I am now. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2357s)

And a huge advocate for that. So well done.

I know it's expensive, but you have taken the first step, but you can get government…well you can here in Australia and anybody's thinking about leaving, get the roof over your head, get yourself a job and then third most important thing is therapy. So good on you, Jenny, for doing that. That's amazing. You, you'll leap ahead in terms of clearing out your whatever that happened to you.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2383s)

Yeah, I had really bad depression in there and so my parents were like, you need to see a doctor and a therapist and then suggested a Christian therapist for me. And so I didn't really want to go to that therapist, but I did just to appease them and then I managed to get out of it when she told me that I should leave the PBCC. I went to my parents and was like, the therapist that you recommended who is a Christian told me to leave. So [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2413s) going to find my own now. And they were like, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2421s)

That therapist has now been knocked off their list. She is no longer on the PBCC therapist list.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2425s)

Were they like, back to Dr. Roger? No, this therapist didn't work. We have to cross that one off. Next toxic therapist. 

Yeah, I do, I do understand like, you know, some people do want a Christian therapist or a therapist that's placed in their beliefs, but therapy should be very Switzerland, should be very neutral. It should be a safe space for you to explore all facets of religion, all parts of yourself, because otherwise how do you heal every part of yourself if there's a bias?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2455s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2456s)

But you know, that's just my thoughts on therapy. It should be very neutral. And do you ever think.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2462s)

Jenny, like where would you be right now if you stayed there, stayed in?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2467s)

I honestly don't think I would be alive. I spent ages about 11 to 20 praying that God would make me straight and I remember lying in bed in tears just begging for the Lord to take this quote-unquote test of faith away from me because that's what they like to call it in there. And then around 18, I kind of figured that my prayers weren't being answered, so I just started praying that I would die. And [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2497s) was kind of the theme for a couple years there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2501s)

Do you feel like you were pushed, right? Because I, I too suffer from anxiety and therefore depression and pushed to the point of suicide. Did you ever like get pushed to that point? Do you think that's, that's something that would have been there if, if you had stayed?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2517s)

Oh, absolutely. There were times when I would drive out in my car and just drive around town for a bit and see cliffs or stuff like that and I would be like, it would just be so easy to just end it. Yeah, thankfully I never did, but never tried, but yeah, it was definitely something that was an, I thought was a valid option.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2538s)

That was kind of almost glorified by the person as well. I remember being at meetings in Sydney where Bruce Hales said, you're better to die than to go on sinning.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2547s)

Yeah, and…

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2547s)

So like if you took that literally, then yeah, taking your own life was one way out.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2553s)

And you had, you sort of justified with some sort of martyrism, like you, you leave this…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2559s)

The scary part of him saying that and when you do talk to people about that, they're like, oh, that's not exactly what he means. He doesn't mean it like that. But you think of people 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, even 25, that is literal to somebody who is suffering extreme anxiety, extreme depression, extreme self-identity, not being able to grow, having to hide in a closet. Like that we take that literally, [anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2589s) will take that thoroughly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2590s)

There's three, four of us sitting here that have heard him say that, or three of us that have heard him say that that took it literally, that were innocent victims in there that that thought about suicide because our leader Bruce Hales said it's a better option. So to say that he didn't mean it like that, well then how can three different people from all over the globe can take it that way? Because you do mean it like that. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2614s)

I mean, and also how can, they printed in the white book his literal instruction to a young person to take rat poison because they were better to kill themselves and have contact with outsiders? And they have, that's never ever explained away why he said that. And their solution was when the, the brown books, the ministry books got printed, they just cut out that entire section that had been printed in the white book as though it never happened. And if you compare the white book and the final ministry book, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2644s) like six or eight pages that are missing where he just goes on and on and on about how this young person should be taking rat poison to kill themselves. Like there's, there's no ambiguity in that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2653s)

No, no, I agree. Jenny, do you believe this, that the PBCC is a cult?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2659s)

Yeah, I'm, I mean, I've looked at the dictionary definition and at checklists and it fits all of it to a T. So I, I think it is. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2670s)

It's really hard for us to admit that. I know because you're fresh out. Like it took me a long time. When people used to say it to me, oh my God, you're a part of a cult. I would like look around waiting for a lightning bolt from God to strike me down because I was agreeing with it. And then I realized, hang on, no, no, they are.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2688s)

Yeah, it's hilarious because I used to love listening to podcasts or watching videos about cults like the Jonestown Massacre and yes, the people or the church of God or the children of God or whatever it was. And I would be listening to this inside there and then I left and I was like, oh wait, I was in a cult too.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2710s)

Yeah, yeah. Another leaver was saying they were in meetings in Sydney not long before they left. This would be a few years ago and I remember Bruce Hales shouting in the meeting, we are not a cult.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2724s)

Usually if you have to say that, you're probably are in one.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2727s)

And if you have to cut your own words out of your own propaganda, it speaks for itself. I remember hearing a recording recently of saying, oh, you know, if our brother wants to chop something out, that's his prerogative. I'm like, what? You question that and say, okay, what's he chopping out? Like how, how stupid are you? Honestly, I mean, like to call it bluntly, you, you obviously are so blindly following it that you don't even question that what he's saying, he realizes could be damaging or [toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2757s) and defaming if it gets out to the public. So therefore he feels it necessary to cut it out and you're just like, oh yes, his prerogative.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2767s)

I mean, so I was in Sydney for what, six or eight weeks or something and I remember like closely following what had been said in the meetings with what then got printed in the white books and they, there were things that were changing definitely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2778s)

Yeah, well after the last Aberdeen, they couldn't let that happen again.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2783s)

And you know what it, when in my opinion, what gets said in a meeting should be completely printed in their ministry. There should be no edits, absolutely no edits. Like there's just, if you're coming from.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2802s)

God, isn't it? It's a word from God. So why should it be edited? Should be flawless.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2806s)

Sorry, sorry Brethren, we'll just back up. We think God got this one wrong.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2813s)

God sent me a text on WhatsApp and was like, scrap your last sentence. I didn't mean it like that. It's your mouth, it's wrong.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2819s)

Jenny, how much have you found community support since you've left? Do you have a support team?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2828s)

Yeah, I have found that the recent leavers and all the leavers are definitely a huge help.

And I've got a group of friends now who are really supportive of, I know inside they say leavers or opposers are basically the devil himself, but they really aren't. If you want to experience actual, real, unconditional love, these people have it for you more than the people inside there, I would say.

And there's great online resources and resources is in my area personally that are LGBT friendly, super supportive and you can find friends there quite easily.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2882s)

And there are so many walks of life out here in terms of friend of support groups. Like I know particularly in Sydney, there are a lot of like Christian based that are, that are, you know, welcoming to the whole community. So it doesn't matter. You don't have to, you know, you feel like, oh, you're stepping over there. It's or that's a, that no one has any sort of religious beliefs at all. That's not true. They're very open and there's that, there are so, there's a plethora of [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2913s) out here and communities out here. You'll find your groove, you'll find where you're safe in, you'll find where you're happy in. 

And you know, the interesting thing is when you was talking to me about how you were suffering from depression in there. So the last person helped leave, he was suffering in a, he was actually, and he won't mind me speaking about this, he was in a rehab for for depression. And you know, they were like, this is it, this is how we fix you. And there are a lot of others in there and we're breaking him [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2943s) of that, bringing him home, giving him a normal life, showing him my routine. I show him how to live and setting up with new friends and meeting other friends. All of a sudden, you know, the anxiety stops, the, the, the need for the medication because you're on, you're on antidepressants stops.

And then before you know, before you like, you've got a job, you've got routine and you're like, wait, was that me? Was that me back there? You know, I, I related to that because I had a very similar experience, although I didn't, yeah, I didn't [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=2973s) to rehab. I probably would have. It, it's you stop all the, the parts of your life that are causing you the anxiety, which is the environment you're in, the toxic environment you're in. And you'll, you'll be surprised how much your life changes. You, you're in there, stuck in there now with without a single light at the end of the tunnel and you are thinking about things like suicide because that is a, a thought that we've all touched on. And you'll be surprised how different your life is once you get out, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3003s) the anxieties just slip away. Yes, you have other things like bills to pay and you know, rent you at the end of the week or finding a job, but they're just normal everyday things. They're achievable things, realistic things.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3014s)

What are some fun things that you've done since leaving? Shortly after leaving, I went to a drag slash comedy show and I was smiling the entire time. It was, yeah, probably the first time that I really felt safe and at home and like I found people who understood some of what I've been through, but who I was didn't really affect how they treated me in like the best way possible.

There's really no feeling like knowing that you're accepted by everyone around you.

And then I got my first non-PBCC job on my own, which is an awesome experience. You've been hired for your skills and not because they're keeping you out of trouble or whatever they think you need a job for.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3065s)

How is that going? Are you enjoying your new workforce?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3070s)

Yeah, it's, it's a really good, good place to work. All the people, they're super supportive.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3076s)

Amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3077s)

Oh, it's so heartwarming. I love it. What would you say to those inside the PBCC that are still stuck in the closet and have, aren't able to come out?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3092s)

And are terrified of us outsiders as a fresh person, what would you say?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3097s)

Yeah, I know leaving isn't super easy and might not even be possible for some people depending on their age and whatnot. But I would say the best thing you can do is find a good therapist, someone with like an outside perspective that you can trust and talk to them about it and they'll help you through it. And then as soon as you can leave, do so because it's the best thing you can do for yourself and your mental health. And there are a ton of people out here [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3128s) know what you're going through or what you will be going through and leaving and are ready to support you. But yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3139s)

And like besides obviously you left because you couldn't be who you were in there, but what were some of the other reasons leading, like what other reasons were there for you leaving?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3149s)

I wasn't a fan of the amount of control that they had, like the social control, sometimes financial control, psychological control. The control over technology was a big one for me because I value my privacy and there wasn't a lot of it in there. 

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

And have you faced any backlash since leaving?

**Jenny**

There are days where I still really, really struggle with internalized homophobia. And I don't think that that ever really goes away considering how we were raised.

But therapy always really helps with that.

I've also found myself, yeah. Yeah, I've also found myself unemployed a few times, but the Lord has always provided me, provided for me in one way or another. And I would say that the guilt tripping from people in the cult is unbelievable in my experience and it only gets worse after you leave.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3212s)

Yeah, yeah. And we've all experienced that to some degree, but and what you said about the homophobia is really interesting because my cousin and I just, who's also gay, signed up to a amazing sports group in the city where it's very inclusive and there are like 240 acute, like gay, lesbian, non-binary, straight, bi, whatever, anyone, but it's predominantly gay, the queer community, right? And we were like, we don't have many gay friends. We have our family and mates and most of my mates are straight and or [lesbians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3242s) and I just, we were there and really enjoying our first game last weekend.

 We've got another game today and we just had this conversation where we're like, wow, the homophobia still, like for me, still exists inside of me. I'm still not as accepting as I thought I was, you know, and it's and I looked at like, I sort of pulled it apart from a psychological perspective and and thought, what is it? What parts of me is, where is that coming from? What, why do I think that about that person or my immediate reaction to [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3272s) person? And then you know, that person became on my team and we became really good mates for it was like, why did I instantly put up that wall? And it was a projection. It was that, you know, it might, he might have been a bit more effeminate and that part of me I hated growing up because that's the part of me that was bullied. Yeah, and I thought, you know, I've touched with my feminine side, what hell, but no, you're right. It's still, there's still parts of us that we don't access and then things happen, events happen, life happens and and it's tipped out and you know, pulled out and you have to sort of [jigsaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3303s) puzzle all back together again. It's always a work in progress, but yeah, it's, it's interesting you say that because I'm seven years out and still experience that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3314s)

That was so beautifully put. I mean, they talk about, right, like the stuff that's put in your brain up to age three, those it's those, those that subconsciously is the foundation we walk on all the time. Hence why they're so good at brainwashing in there, right? You're born into it. They have access to your brain right away and it is, it's those things, even though we leave, I have people tell me that all the time, right, where they see still the, the PB part [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3344s) me, right? It is, it's in there and I think it's something that we have to navigate all the time on all the levels. For me, it's fear. It's always irrational fears that come out of nowhere, but I know where they stemmed from. But it's, it was that was just very beautifully put, babe. That was awesome.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3361s)

But the incredible thing I think is that despite all this brainwashing and conditioning that goes on, there are still people over and over and over who are deciding that it's not a good place to be. Exactly what you're saying earlier, Jenny, about them assuming that there was some person helping you on the outside. I had exactly the same experience with my brother when he started questioning things in the church and everyone in the Brethren just assumed that he was talking to me and that I was [influencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3391s) him with these thoughts since I haven't talked to him for seven years, but he's quite capable of arriving at his own judgment of the fact that this is a messed up system.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3399s)

But that's so true, Craig. Like it happens everywhere. My cousin who I helped her leave two years ago, she said that so she wrote a resume for her job, right? And she was quite proud of it. She's great. And I looked over and was like, yeah, this is perfect or maybe fix your grammar here or something like send it off, got a job, right? And her mom was like, who did that for you? How did you get a job? Who paid who? It was like, far be it you get it on your own merit, right? [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3429s) get it on your own. You can actually successfully succeed out here. Barbie, the thought for that. It's just interesting hearing that other people, it's like the narrative that the Brethren spin is like, no, you know, all you like, you talk, you won't make it. So you've got to adjust the scenario to suit as to why the person did.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3448s)

Yeah, and I guess that's one of the things, isn't it, is that we're not out here trying to make people leave and we're not telling people they should leave because everyone needs to make their own decisions. But we're here to support people who do make that decision. Yeah, I think the president have this idea that we're just watching and waiting and actively trying to pull people out, but that's not true, is it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3472s)

No, and it's their narratives. They have such screwed up narratives. They, I mean, the narratives I've heard about myself in this podcast and like how I'm doing what I'm doing. I mean, Ben's experienced it, that he's getting paid for me. I'm like, I've just completely been coerced into doing what I'm doing and you know, I've, it's like they just can't read, they can't come to terms that we would just step up and be ourself, who we are, do what we do, get a job, what we want [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3502s) get, like take a hold of your life because they can't imagine that. They just can't wrap their head around it. 

And it is, it is one of the things that I love doing these podcasts for is because it really, again, it does, it breaks the narrative that they are believing for those that are ready to listen. There's so many that have one foot in and one foot out. And when we keep on doing these, these, these podcasts, again, it breaks a narrative for Jenny. I'm sure when they figure out who she is again, it's going to be like, seriously, I did not coerce her. Craig did not [coerce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3533s) her. Ben did not coerce her. She wanted to do this all on her own.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3536s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3538s)

Thank you for it because there we have, you know, I think now a few gay voices out here from men and it's, it's great that now women are speaking up. You will, you will be, you know, the pioneer for that. So thank you.

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3552s)

Yeah, I really wanted to come on here just because I know personally, I, it would have really helped to have had a lesbian to know that I'm not the only one inside there. I mean, we knew that there was gay, gay men in there because I think it's harder for them to fly under the radar, but for lesbians, it's a lot easier to pass as straight while you're in there. So it's, you kind of feel quite alone in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3579s)

What steps do you think should be taken to hold these, hold the, hold the PBCC accountable for, you know, perpetuating such discrimination in their group?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3592s)

I'm not sure that there's a way to undo the harm they've already done. I just want them to know that there will be more LGBTQIA+ children in there. And it's not a choice these kids make, who would choose to be someone who is so openly discriminated against and that will inevitably lose their family or friends for being themselves.

And just in being so hateful towards an entire group of human beings, they're ruining their relationships with any child who might be part of that group. And now these kids have no safe space and no adult to go to, and they can't talk about what they're feeling. So they're really isolating these kids who have the misfortune of being born into a homophobic cult.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3642s)

Yeah, brilliantly put, brilliantly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3646s)

And this is why it's so important for people to come forward with their story and put their voice out there. Like I was, I'm just, I was so grateful when you said you wanted to do this because we didn't, we've never, we haven't had a female on here, right? It's been all men. We haven't had a gay female on here bring her herself forward and put her voice out there, which you know that this is going to reach how many females in there that felt like you who are still [feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3676s) like you.

I'm just so grateful. I'm so grateful that you came on to tell your story. Before we close out though, I just want to ask you, what would you want to say to your family today?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3687s)

I just really wish they'd take a step back and look at the big picture. What mainstream Christian church is more focused on money and later than they are on God and just if you look at it from an outside perspective, you'll see so many things that aren't Christian about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3706s)

Yeah, I agree. And that's why we do what we do.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3711s)

It's amazing. Thank you so much, Jenny, for coming on. It's, I know it's a huge step of fear and unknown really. So thank you. And you know, if you are at all identified or people do, you, you, you might not understand or know who you're reaching, but you, you will have people come forward and I, you know, the moment experience has been five years, somebody said they've been following my journey and and it was what they followed that helped them come forward, me sharing my story. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3741s) you know, you're doing the same. It's amazing. You never know what will happen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3745s)

Yeah, and I mean, and if you're somebody inside who resonates with her story, feel free to email us, info.getalife at proton.me and you know, we can put you in touch with Jenny if, yeah, there's lots of us to.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3760s)

Any of us on our socials, we're more than happy to chat. We're not old bitter men on our deathbeds talking about this horrible experience we had.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3769s)

And not, we're not hard to find, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3773s)

Not anymore. Was there anything else you wanted to say, Jenny?

### [**Jenny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3781s)

Just thank you very much for having me on here. I'm really thankful to have a chance to share my story and hopefully help other people who are stuck in there who've been through the same thing as me or are going through it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaZM_AMoaLk&t=3795s)

Well, we're grateful you came on, so thank you. Thank you. Okay, until next time everyone, much love to everybody. Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
