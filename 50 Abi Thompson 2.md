### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=57s)

So I will now share my screen and go into my presentation on sexual abuse. This is my opinion and some of it is taken from literature and support groups that I attend.

So I'm going to cover what is sexual abuse or incest, how could it affect you, and why is there so much of it in the brethren. I'm going to speak about the law being brought into the UK shortly. How does sexual abuse affect you as a child and how does it affect you as an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse.

The definition of sexual abuse or incest is an act of power against a child that takes a sexual form. It is a violation and betrayal of the sexual innocence and purity of a child. It may include suggestive or seductive talk or behaviour directed at the child. It may include invasive touching. This includes unwanted kissing, wrestling, tickling. It may include non-medical enemas, [showing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=131s) a child pornography or nudity, sexual touch, fondling, oral sex, sodomy and or intercourse.

So I've put this on here because some people that I've spoken to have said, "we don't even know what sexual abuse is in the brethren, we haven't actually had that education." So I've put this slideshow together to give them, because I know they watch this, let's be honest, we did when we were in there. So this is the information that they may well, they clearly need because they don't know.

It's important to know that it's not uncommon for survivors to wonder if [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=177s) imagine the experience. It's important to note that children do not on their own imagine situations of sexual arousal or violation. As an adult, if you think something happened, it probably did. The truth is shown by the emotions you feel as you try to recount these memories.

Incest is most likely to happen in situations where the child believes the adult will protect them. Unfortunately, these perpetrators can be parents, siblings, family, family friends, babysitters, neighbours, members from church, teachers, doctors or others in a position of trust. 90% of abused children are abused by someone they know.

My opinion of why there are such high levels of child sexual abuse in the PBCC. Everyone trusts everyone. Brethren are taught not to have enmity. I mean it doesn't work, but you know the teaching is there, and to love one another. It's a very close-knit community. Perpetrators are rarely held accountable in the PBCC. The only times they are held accountable for their actions is when there is police involvement.

Unfortunately, many Brethren members who have been abused are too scared to report it to the police. Therefore the perpetrator knows that he or she will get away with it. Responsible priests that become aware of the situation don't usually feel the need to report it. They want to handle it themselves. In my local place, as I discussed earlier, I remember a man who abused children was asked to sign a piece of paper that he didn't do it. That was enough for the priest not to report it.

Reputation of the brethren is the number one priority for everyone. Protecting the assembly and the testimony money is made a point of at most church meetings. They sadly put the welfare of the church way above the health and the wellbeing of the victim.

There's a law that's going to be potentially brought into the UK following the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. The Home Secretary is to spell out new requirements for people working with children in England to report signs or suspicions of sexual abuse. The UK will be strengthened in legislation to ensure those who fail to do so, e.g. report [it,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=339s) will face the full force of the law.

Therefore, those in the brethren that are aware of sexual abuse and have tried to sweep it under the carpet will face criminal proceedings. Now, that will be a massive, big, horrible thing for them. Because the brethren's way of dealing with abuse, you know, 99% of the time is to lift that carpet up, sweep it under and then paste it back down. So if those children then years on be like, "hang on, nah you knew about it and you swept it under the carpet," then they're going to be in deep do-do's.

How does sexual abuse affect you as a child? The child may have nightmares or sleep problems. They may change their personality and seem frightened. They may go quiet or perhaps need a lot of attention. They [regress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=399s) to younger behaviour, e.g. bedwetting. They have a fear of particular places or people. They have outbursts of anger, change their eating habits, have physical signs such as soreness, bleeding or bruises around private areas, become secretive and withdrawn, act out in inappropriate sexual ways with toys or objects or act older than their age e.g obsessively interested in opposite sex from young age.

How does sexual abuse affect adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse? Difficult emotions, you can kind of, I'll just run through these briefly, you can read it for yourselves, and feeling alone and difficulty in having healthy relationships, feelings of guilt and shame, feeling powerless, sexual difficulties, including problems with physical contact and intimacy, anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks, dissociation and memory problems. And these are [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=471s) characteristics of PTSD as well. So, yeah, not nice. And that is that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=486s)

Thanks, Abi, because I think if anyone in The Brethren, as you say, we know they watch this. Ignorance plays a large part I think.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D500s)

Oh, 100%.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D502s)

Ignorance on the part of those that are in authority, ignorance on the part of parents, and seeing those warning signs. In my work role, we have to be trained to spot signs, we have to be trained to spot, so you have an awareness, but there's none of that training in the brethren.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=522s)

They have tried to start implementing it. That would have been what, about a year and a half ago, there was meetings in most OneSchool Global regarding this, but it was nothing detailed, it was very vague and very, it wasn't taken as seriously as it should be considering the level of abuse that there is in the brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=554s)

That was possibly just a tick box exercise to say, "yeah we do this, we train, we train."

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=562s)

100%, like most things in there. Sorry Cheryl, you're muted.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=569s)

There was a teacher and a principal that had reached out to me in regards to this that had been implemented, and when this person reported what she had witnessed, she was let go. It doesn't surprise me though. So like when she reached out to me, she's like this, like, so it is, yes, they do have this implementation of it, but there's no follow through. The follow through doesn't happen the way that it should happen.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=599s)

Right. Well, one of the children that I know, I believe social services was involved. I don't know to what extent, but then it all just...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=611s)

It sort of goes away somehow, doesn't it? And nobody, I don't know how.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=615s)

Like I just, like obviously maybe money's involved or threat or...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=622s)

Well I have to say, I don't have a huge amount of confidence in the authorities in the UK. I think social services are, they have a lot of policies, but they're actually only as good as the person who deals with the case. And if you get somebody who's good and can see things and takes responsibility and ownership of a case and follows it through in the correct way, but I also think [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=652s) doesn't always happen.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=654s)

And also due to underfunding, they're stretched to the limit as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=657s)

Stretched, yeah, yeah. So I mean, I, like you, I don't know how it goes away, but I can believe it does. It might be a two-fold problem, but at the end of the day, it goes away and it shouldn't do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=671s)

It's easier for it to go away than it to be dealt with on so many different levels.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=677s)

Because again, it's the reputation of the brethren and that's number one. So it's easy for it to disappear when it's to be made a thing out of. And I think that's what happened with me by offering me money. Well, I'm afraid you picked the wrong person because I just don't buy it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=704s)

And what they don't seem to understand is they're brushing all of this rubbish that happens under the carpet, but actually to the outside world, and they want to portray themselves of this loving Christian community that puts family at the heart of everything, you're laughing, the family at the heart of everything it does. If there is a problem of sexual abuse, they would actually gain far more respect as a Christian community if they called it out and dealt with it. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't they? [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=735s) people outside here would say, "You know what, they had a problem, but they're dealing with it," because we can live with that. And they would actually gain more respect if they dealt with it in the correct way. Also, I think it would happen less often if they dealt with it in the correct way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=752s)

Because it would solve it all, it would all be solved just by taking accountability.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=756s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=757s)

And just like, just find a way to implement that accountability through it all. I mean, there were no, you know, they're worried about the stain. I mean the Catholic church has survived it, right? Like you see they...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=771s)

They all survive it, yeah. And it could actually improve their reputation because people who know nothing could say, "look, here was a church that had a major problem, but boy, look what they did, they called it out and they're, you know, as a result," and they would gain more respect for that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=791s)

Yeah, there was one case about two or three years ago, maybe even not that long ago, where the man was dealt with and it went into, it went into the press. I remember that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=809s)

Horrendous, horrendous. And I seem to remember the first newspaper report that came out mentioned that this person was a member of the PBCC, and then that got redacted and every report subsequently, it wasn't mentioned, was it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=829s)

But we all knew who that person was. And I think a lot of naive brethren were like, "see, it is dealt with." No, it's not. That's one person out of what?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=850s)

If I remember that particular case correctly, it was dealt with because it was actually discovered by an external authority and they had no choice to deal with it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=864s)

Discovered by a person's partner on his phone.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=871s)

Right.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=871s)

Just yeah, yeah, unbelievable. Like I can't imagine the pain the partner went through. And the partner reported it, and then UBT was raided and the home was raided and it blew up into something far greater than any, I mean I worked with [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=901s) person at UBT and I always knew there was something weird.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=907s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=908s)

But they couldn't deny that one once the first day...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=914s)

Sorry Abi, say that again.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=916s)

So thank goodness the person never got close to me because at that age, you know, I was 16 when I worked there. You know, I could have easily been sucked in because I was so, I was still a child and I'd been abused, so it would have been very easy for him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=938s)

Yeah, but once the premises and home were raided by the police, it had to be dealt with through official channels because once it got to that stage, they couldn't brush that one under the carpet.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=954s)

No, but it took that brave partner reporting it in the first place. And I'm so proud of that person.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=963s)

Did they get recommended for reporting it by the brethren?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=971s)

I don't know personally, but I expect so. Knowing what goes on behind closed doors, I expect they were. I think. So, does anyone else have any questions before I go on?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=996s)

Yeah, let's move on to your next presentation.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1001s)

Oh, let me set it up. So, here we go. Can you see? Yeah. So it is my belief that the PBCC is a cult. So I've done a kind of study on it deeply and it's been really good for me as well to do it because it's reiterated exactly what I thought in the first place. So here we go.

What is a cult? A cult is a group of people that usually follow a single holy leader who is often said to be the closest thing to God or Christ. I've put Christ because, you know, that's what it is in the brethren. The group will use thought stopping, slash guilt and fear tactics to control the members. The leader is often said to have a special knowledge regarding the end of times.

There is an insider versus outsider sectioning of information, e.g. brethren or worldly. Insiders are led to believe they have more information than outsiders. They believe that they're closer to God than outsiders. This is scripture from Bruce Hales, "we have the light and those that have gone out have turned their back on the light." So that shows it quite clearly.

No questions are to be asked in a cult. If members ask questions, they may be put down, but they aren't ready for the teaching. "Put your faith in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1106s) great men and they will bring us through" is a quote, I don't know who said it, but someone did because it's like written in my head.

They have an elitist mentality. So we were led to believe that we're God's chosen people and in the bible it speaks about Christ's bride and we know they are Christ's bride, that's what they believe. Strict obedience is required and I was at a meeting where Bruce Hales said this and I was like, "that's such a great saying." [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1147s) I was really sucked in, "if you don't understand it, don't oppose it."

Members of the cult will have their time and routine strictly laid out. And you know, at the Lord's supper, the first day of the week, before the supper even starts, they'll go through every day of the week and they'll say what meeting is on which day and where, and then everyone will say amen and that's your commitment to abide to [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1177s) routine.

So I've been reading a book called, "Combating Cult Mind Control" and this is by Stephen Hassan and he did a study about there being three steps to mind control within a cult. Step one is unfreezing, and this is the step where they try to break down a person mentally, emotionally, financially or physically and many people are led to believe that they can't trust their own needs.

Step two is changing, and this is forced introduction to doctrine and indoctrination process. The focus is put on the wrongdoing and they will then introduce the right way, backed [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1227s) with scriptures which suit the right way.

And step three is refreezing. So this is building a new artificial, slash right identity with a complete write-off of your old self. Must not want to return to your old life or identity and it may mean giving up on friends, family, hobbies. You may be forced to make a public confession and elders may distort [memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1257s) or try to cause confusion.

This is my experience with three steps of mind control. Step one, the unfreezing stage or step. Yeah. So in the brethren, I'd called this stage a "getting right" stage. I discussed with my husband how the getting right stage would actually come about and he made a very interesting comment that brethren are programmed from young to have an extremely sensitive and overreactive conscience. We are also programmed to be somewhat of a self-grasser, that's a new word, because unless you've been found out about something, the [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1303s) way you'd come into this getting right realm is if you grass up on yourself.

Sadly, we automatically feel that we need to tell someone if we haven't toed the line. We are then quoted ministry and on the rare occasion scriptures by priests who are usually wealthy local brethren men who will make you feel as guilty as possible to help break you. They'll do it though in a sickly sweet way so you can't say they were nasty to you.

Guilt is heaped upon you and when you tell them how unhappy you are in the brethren, you are quoted the scripture. You are often quoted the scripture in John 12 verse 25, "he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal." Then they will quote Bruce Hales about, "we haven't been promised an easy way," and then they say stuff like, "it will all be right in the end."

For me, I wasn't going to stick around in there and suffer until they decided [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1366s) sort it out and all be right in the end. Like, no, it's just not happening for me. But those that hate it in there will use that phrase as their justification for staying. And the other thing they will use is, "there's a thousand reasons to go and there's one reason to stay." And I used those sayings, they're very clever, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1396s) clever, like they know what they're doing in terms of sayings. You know, it's easy to remember and I believe them and that's what kept me there. But if you're willing to sacrifice everything for that one reason, which is Bruce Hales, then yeah…

When we were in the brethren, we were contacted relentlessly about the trivial stuff, eating and drinking on church Zoom, makeup, camping, and it drove us mad. There was constant phone calls from the priest, like at least once every three days. It was borderline harassment. Because you're still in the Brethren mindset, you feel obliged to call them back. Not in the end, we wouldn't, but anyway.

It was reported that we had a satellite dish on the side of the house. We think that it was one of the old sisters that lived near us. “Sisters” to those that aren't connected to brethren, is the women in the church. The only thing that we can think of that they'd have thought was a satellite dish was an air conditioning unit. But they're so naive, maybe they did.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1478s)

More than likely.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1483s)

But we still don't have a satellite dish now, we don't need one. Not interested. I don't have time to watch telly for the sake of it. Camping, we absolutely love the outdoors as a family, well when it's warm anyway. We do live in Britain after all. My therapist, whilst we were in the brethren, told me to go camping. I was on the edge of a breakdown and was not coping at all. So we went off with our tent to the Brecon Beacons and set up. We turned our phones off and we were so happy.

And then, big mistake, we turned our phones on for music and ping, ping, messages from one of the priests came through. Now this was my fault, okay, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1531s) there was another beautiful lady that has struggled with her mental health in the brethren for years and I said to her husband, "you need to do something like this, my therapist has said go camping, you need to do this." And yeah, he grassed on us. Anyway, so those that are in that want to go camping, just keep your mouth shut, okay?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1558s)

Yeah, and go, and go, just turn your phone off.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1563s)

And we had a message saying, "It's come to my attention that you've gone camping, I hope it's not true, please ring me as soon as possible." So as you can see, our every move was being dissected in this unfreezing stage. The pressure was intense, emotionally we're exhausted, physically we're exhausted. We tried to get away for a bit, for a bit of sanity, and no, you couldn't even do that in peace. And we learned pretty fast to trust no one.

An interesting point my [husband](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1594s) made whilst I was writing this is that these so-called priests probably don't realize that they are playing with people's minds. They would never actually admit to that. It is an inbred thought pattern that it is right and normal to assert control to keep the assembly pure. Most members accept that and respect it, but it's the brethren like us who see through the bullshit that are clamped down on because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1624s) suppose we're a threat to the system.

When we said we're leaving, they said to me, "oh but you haven't made very good decisions in the past, have you?" They make you doubt every part of your being. We were also threatened that our children would, and this cut deep and that's why they said it, our children would be more likely to be abused outside the brethren than if we stayed.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1660s)

Yeah, that's a wicked thing to say.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1663s)

I've heard that from other people, that that's been used on them when they've left or have tried to leave.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1668s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean the difference outside, I'm not saying it doesn't happen outside the brethren, but the difference outside is it doesn't need to be swept under the carpet. Exactly, you can call it out.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1683s)

Yeah, you're not forced to break bread or go to meetings or have people in the house that you know clearly have an issue. And like there's one person who I, red flags, and it was confirmed to me that, you know, he had abused children in his past, but because it was 30 years ago, it was quoted to me [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1714s) scripture, Matthew, I think it's Matthew 6, I think it's either verse 14 or 15 about, let me think of the wording, "if you do not forgive another for their sins, then your father will not forgive you yours."

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1743s)

And that's the difference out here, isn't it? That however historical the abuse is, it will get dealt with.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1750s)

Yes. And you don't, like, I was borderline forced to forgive. I will never forgive the man that abused me. No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D1758s)

But why should you? You shouldn't. You can live with it, but why should you forgive him?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D1763s)

No, I don't need to. I don't need to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1770s)

It is one act on this planet that doesn't need to be forgiven. Those perpetrators steal the most sacred innocent part of a child.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1781s)

I'd rather be murdered than go through what I went through.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1783s)

Yeah, I agree with you.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1784s)

And that's not saying I want to be murdered, so no one get that gist of that. But you know, it would have been easier to not live through that and live with, you know, I was saying to my husband the other day, you know, these the effects of what's happened to me is gonna live with me until, you know, I'm six foot under. And I will fight every day against the effects, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1815s) as other, you know, I'm sure Gilli and Cheryl and any others on here that have been abused can relate to.

You know, we fight the effects every single day and the toll that it puts on you, no one will ever realize. You know, you like, triggers me driving and driving along in the car and a car drives past similar to the [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1845s) that one of my abusers had and I'm straight back there. You know, thankfully through therapy and like intensive therapy and other groups that I go to, you know, I can then call myself back. But that's hard on itself, you know, it's called grounding in the psychological world. But that took years of learning, you know, and I'm still learning now. Yeah, so that scripture was, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1890s)

You know, I mean, what you and Gilli and Cheryl have experienced is thankfully not something I've experienced. But what I do think is speaking about it publicly, if it stops it happening to one person, it will, it's never going to put right what happened to you because you can't, because something was stolen from you. But if it stops it happening to one other person, one other child, then you can feel that your experiences, there is a glimmer of good that's come out of them for somebody else. And that's why I have so much respect for people that speak out about this, I really do.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1932s)

Because you know, people think, "oh, here she goes again." No, I don't do it for, it's the hardest thing to talk about, hence I've read most of it. Like it takes it out of me, you know, I'll go to bed now and I'll sleep for hours. You know, it physically, mentally, emotionally shatters you, drains you. If I can change one child's life by telling my story, it's worth it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1966s)

And I mean, I can attest the fact of how long this has taken you, Abi, to build the courage up when you first reached out to me, right? Like it's taken you months of preparation and dealing with your own stuff to be able to get to the point of doing what you're doing today.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=1984s)

Yeah, absolutely. And even today, I've been like, "oh, this is scary." I've had anxiety attacks a lot, but you know, I'm not doing it for any recognition, I'm not doing it for pity. I don't want pity, you know. Compassion wouldn't go amiss, but I'm not doing it for anything for myself.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2012s)

Anybody who comes forward and talks about this kind of a subject does not do it for themselves.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2017s)

No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2018s)

No, no, absolutely not.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2020s)

No. So then we go on to step two, I'm going to put the slide back, which is changing. So me, this is the step of brethren getting or coming into the clear or becoming clear of their sins. So obviously this scripture quoted in regards to forgiving the man who abused me was a big focus in priestly visits. If I didn't forgive him, I'd never move on, I'd never get over it.

I was asked in one of the priest's lounge to [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2060s) identify where the abuse became your lust as a child. And I passed out according to my husband and they called paramedics. So here's my answer, it was never my lust. God designed our bodies to respond to certain touches. God designed us to feel pleasure, but I was a child. I should never ever have been introduced to those feelings. A child isn't meant to know those feelings. It rewires your brain to [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2106s) like those feelings are feelings of love.

I was neglected in every other area of my life and I was groomed to think that that was love. The perpetrator spoke to me about marriage. It was never my lust. That's my answer. Anyhow, the next day, the priest that said it, he rang my husband and he said, "do you think she was faking passing out to get out of answering the question?" And he said, "I think I pushed it a little bit too far." Yes, you did. Yeah, you pushed it far too far to the point that I passed out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2157s)

Thinking realistically about it, none of it is their business. If they knew what was happening, they should have reported it and left it there. They're not equipped or trained to deal with this kind of thing, are they? But they think they are because it's a power trip. Yeah. And because they're not equipped to deal with this type of thing or to know how to talk to the survivors of this kind of abuse, this is what happens. They're like bulls in a china shop over it, aren't they, to put it mildly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2194s)

Yeah, and it absolutely, you know, I was doing well at that point. Yeah, absolutely ruined me to be asked that. Like I was like, "shit, you know, where was it actually, when did I actually start enjoying it?" And you know, that's not thoughts I want to be thinking. And it can be so damaging to a survivor of abuse to even, you know, go down that route. Like no, no, no, no, you need professional...

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2229s)

But doesn't that just point out though, the complete lack of understanding that they've got of abuse as a whole subject? To even, for it to even enter someone's head that as a child, there was a, there was going to be a point there where it became lust. I mean, it's just, anyone with any kind of degree of understanding of it would know that [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2259s) would should never ever enter into the equation in the first place.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2264s)

Yeah, and it's not hard to put a bit of compassion into it, and well for me anyway. No, what a question to ask. But in the brethren, there's a beautiful lady, sadly she's passed away, but she did forgive her perpetrator and I don't think that she had any option. I don't think it was a choice for her to do that and she had to survive the brethren system. And you know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2304s) find that really sad. I mean, maybe it was her choice, I don't know, I never spoke to her about it, I never had the chance.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2311s)

And this is my opinion, I think they're perverse. I think they actually get a kick out of getting all the details.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2318s)

Oh, 100%, 100%. Wow, yes. In situations of where young members, not in abusive situations, have had sexual relationships, you know, they're asked to write reports. Yeah, they're filed. Like someone has got some serious erotica stashes somewhere.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2346s)

Yes.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2348s)

There was a young couple where we were local had to get married and they were literally asked by the priest what position they used and all the rest of it. You know, really, it was disgusting, totally disgusting.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2364s)

Oh my days, it's just embarrassing, isn't it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2367s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2368s)

And as if it's any of their business, you know. This is another thing I hate about the brethren is, you know, God, it's your sins are between you and God, you know, and they'll try to put themselves in between that to clear you. No, it's between you and God. But out of it, you know, that's scriptural. I'm just trying to think of the scripture, it's something like God and man as one or something. Yeah, it'll come back to me. But not spiritual enough, clearly.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2413s)

You know your scriptures better than I do.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2415s)

Well, I'm fresh out guys. Yeah, yeah. But no, and this is, this is a, this is, you know, probably the wrong time to make the point, but I am still a Christian. I still go to church and people think that people that leave are, you know, they're going to hell. No, I'm not going to hell. No, not so. See you in heaven guys, in your exclusive Brethren area, and [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2448s) where I enter.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2450s)

Well, or not the case may be in their case.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2454s)

Yeah. For those that are not victims of abuse, I suppose they're under as much pressure to get into the clear. The priests have very clever tactics. One time, one of our priests brought a 90 pound bottle of cognac. It went from, "wow, that's a crazy gift," to, "okay then, let's get everything sorted." They play, excuse me, they play big mind games.

For those that have [biblically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2484s) sinned or put the testimony at risk, there is usually a getting right meeting with all members of the locality present at the local hall. This is the public confession which is usually held on a Tuesday night when no visitors or interchange members are present. The brethren discuss the sin, read a few scriptures, and then the congregation will say amen collectively, forgive the individual. For those who are broken by this process, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2515s) the priests inflict on you, their every move is watched to see if what they tried to indoctrinate works and change happens. So that's step two. Is this all making sense? Yep.

And then we have the refreezing stage. I suppose there is a bit of a hero made out of the person that has come into the clear, [especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2546s) in a public setting, and this is the part of the new identity being formed. Most hero worship the person, you know, "it's so brave to do what you did." New job offers may be made, enhancing their wage, etc. You're invited out to teas and you're invited out for dinners, like not on a Sunday, more often, Lord's day more often. You have this forgiven, cleansed, new identity and you're expected to keep this appearance up.

So this is a story about me. When I came back from Australia and most thought that I had been through this step two changing [process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2589s) and come out on the other side of step three, I went out for a meal in Bristol with some old school friends. Present at that meal was a secret couple. As I left, I whispered, "come on, kiss, no one's looking." The lad who was in my year at school turned to me and said, "you haven't changed a bit, have you?" It was the seven short, sharp words of rejection that made me realize, "oh shit, I've been [rumbled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2620s) and I haven't gone through this step two of mind control."

He remembered that before I went to Australia, I used to have some banter and disregard non-biblical PBCC laws. He remembered that I wouldn't conform to something I didn't agree with. He was expecting me, from living in Sydney, to have completely written off my old self and have a completely new identity which toed the line and abided by every rule. For those that did, so that's the story, you know. Those that are shipped out to Sydney, you're really expected to like be this miracle.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2667s)

I remember somebody else around a similar time that was shipped to Sydney for several months and they left eventually. But when they came back, I remember them explaining after they left, the fuss that was made of them in their local meeting. It was like they'd kind of come back, you know, it was a bit like they'd kind of touched God somehow. And to use an example, this person said they came back and the first thing they did was smashed up their non-brethren computer. That was it. Not, you know, but smashed it up. And then, yeah, it was the fuss that was made of them. And then a few months down the line, everyone forgot about it and nothing had changed. Nothing.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2723s)

Yeah, I was like, it was really exhausting, actually. Yeah. Really exhausting. You know, you get people coming up, you know, "so nice to see you. Wow, you're so brown. Oh, my goodness, you sound so Australian." Like, just leave me alone. You know, I was literally like this form of, I don't know what they thought. But it was just me. Yeah. But I was kind of hero worshipped just because I'd lived in Sydney. And actually, it was horrible. Like, what do you want me to tell you? It was nice. But, you know. Yeah. I didn't smash anything up, though. I didn't have anything to smash up. I wish I smashed some people up, but, you know. Yeah. You have to kind of control yourself, right?

Unfortunately, for those that did choose to toe the line, everyone would comment, "wow, he or she is so different," or "he or she has completely changed, it's incredible." For me, I just thought that they'd lost their zest for life, they'd been broken, their freedom had gone, [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2800s) fun had been ripped out of them and I found it really sad to see people lose their true identity. It's sad to me. I believe that God made everyone to be unique. He gave us all license to be our own person. We are all sinners saved by grace. We have all fallen short of the glory of God, but we don't all need to be PBCC clones.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2824s)

Amen.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2828s)

It's so interesting, like speaking to people not in the brethren, they're like, "why do they all look the same?" And I never noticed like that they all look the same. And the other day I saw a picture of a load of sisters in a school shop and I was like, all literally, they all look exactly the same. Like no one's allowed to have their own true identity and you know, that's something that I didn't agree with and didn't want.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2871s)

Yeah, but isn't that the same of any, in a sense, any totalitarian group that tries to control?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2882s)

I look at the FLDS. I watched documentaries. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2891s)

Yeah. And I think that's the big issue with these kinds of groups, and I do put the brethren in them, is they just don't allow people to be themselves.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2908s)

And so this is some brief, is this in the way or not, is the pictures of you in the way or not?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2917s)

No, because I can minimize it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2920s)

Oh, cool, cool. So these are, these are unwritten rules, so it's not "thou shalt," but everyone knows that this is expected of them. So women wear a token in their hair at all times. Minimal makeup. Bruce Hales said if a sister wears eye makeup, it's usually because she has something to hide. Skirt to the knee in the day and below or on the knee to the meeting. [Already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2957s) said about the skirt story. Clear or subtle nail varnish. No bare legs. That's really funny actually because someone said to me, "what are those awful tights they wear that make their legs look orange but the rest of them is like white?" I was like, "yeah, that's the ones."

So tights and leggings are to be worn. You know, you wouldn't show your legs unless you're a rebel like me and [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=2987s) you're like, "screw it, it's hot, I'm not wearing tights or leggings." No jewellery apart from wedding rings or for medical purposes.

Men, shirt is to be worn, usually plain because Bruce Hales doesn't like patterned shirts. No tie, shirt sleeves below the elbow, especially to church. No shorts, side parting is to show in short hair, no sideburns, no facial hair, strictly clean shaven. And Bruce Hales said in a seminar that a man with a beard is a crook. Which isn't true because...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3025s)

My husband's not a crook. And nor are you, Ross.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3030s)

No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3031s)

Oh, sorry about that. No, no. Yes.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3040s)

These are generic unwritten rules. So your first time home is to be a four bed, two bathroom property. And a lot of people have asked me how this happens, like they can't understand how financially a 19, 20 year old can afford this. So what happens is the brethren business owners will put the wage up for three months so you have three high wage slips to show to the mortgage broker. Now that leaves you in a [pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3070s) horrible situation when you actually get married because you've then got all the other expenses that a marriage brings on top of that mortgage for your old wage. You know, the wage doesn't stay the same, it goes back down.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3093s)

And the mortgage still has to be paid.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3095s)

Absolutely, yeah. And so do bills and you can't not eat and yeah, cars don't go along with no fuel. Your cars have to be fairly new. If you have an older car, you're usually picked on or laughed at or it will get scratched or something. You know, brethren kids can be really cruel. No personalised number plates, no Porsche for safety or BMW. But this will probably change when the Lord turns a corner because years ago it was no Audis or Alfa Romeos and they're both on UBT rebate schemes now.

You're expected to have ministry on all the shelves. There's to be no non-brethren books or novels, no holidays, no camping, no non-UBT phones, laptops or computers, no smart TVs. Bruce Hales wrote a letter in 2020 saying that it would be an issue of fellowship if you had a smart TV. But saying that, a lot of people have them. So I don't [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3171s) maybe they'll clamp down on that at some point, I don't know.

And there is a relocation committee. So if you wanted to move house, you couldn't just pick your house and say, "wow, that's beautiful, yes, and we can afford it, let's move." You have to then speak to your local relocation committee who will then say if it's right and acceptable to move to that home.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3201s)

And what would they make that decision on the basis of?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3204s)

Proximity to the main meeting room, proximity to a local subdivisional meeting room, and how far out of the city it is usually.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D3215s)

Okay.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D3216s)

So these are questions that I've written for brethren to ask [themselves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3234s) Am I genuinely, deeply happy in the brethren? And that's not surface happy, that's deeply happy. Like, am I satisfied with my life in the brethren? Is it fulfilling my needs and wants? Am I feeling loved? Do I feel that the people around me are trustworthy? Do I feel cared for emotionally, mentally, physically in this community? [Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3266s) there people that I can reach out to without feeling judged for just being human? Do I feel safe? Are my children safe?

Are these people's beliefs the same as mine? Have I personally studied the doctrine without interference? And have I come to my own convictions and beliefs? Am I okay with being led by, I should say led by, and idolising someone who thinks that they have been chosen by God as an elect vessel? Am I okay that this leader could be a lover of money? I'm not saying if he is or not. Figure that out yourselves, over against 1 Timothy 6 verse 10, "money is the root of all evil."

Do I have confidence in the prominent leaders in my locality? Do they thrive on power? Do they thrive on financial status or other status within the church? Do they have a genuine deep understanding of scriptures that would come from an intensive study of the Bible? Are their teachings purely biblical or do they echo elect vessel opinion? Is fear of God taught rather than God's love? If my financial or [circumstantial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3344s) brethren lifestyle was removed, what would I be left with? Would I remain in the brethren? Do I feel controlled and am I okay with being controlled? And have I been through the three steps of mind control that I mentioned?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3361s)

I'd love to send that to every member in the PBCC. I know, so don't you. You don't have to give the answers to anybody, you just answer them for yourself, honestly.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3373s)

I think it's massively important actually that people realize and really analyze those questions because they are really good questions and think about them seriously. Don't, like Jacky says, you don't have to tell anyone that you're thinking about those questions, but just think about them long and hard because I think you'll find you have a different opinion once you've actually considered the answers for yourself. I think you'll have a different opinion.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3409s)

Thanks Gilli, it took me bloody ages to do, so I appreciate that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3416s)

Yeah, well, it won't go in vain because we may well use some of those questions, Abi. So, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3422s)

Seriously, people need to have a long, hard think because, you know, they call themselves a Christian church. And, yeah, a lot of those, well, for me, my answers to those questions make me beg to differ if they really are. You know, they read a Christian bible.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3458s)

I was just gonna say question three and four, I think it's something that I, you know, I remember questioning after I left. The question that everyone should ask themselves, especially in the brethren, is why am I actually having to do with these people? Do I actually have anything in common with them or is it just because I've been thrust together with them as a group? You know, [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3488s) I got a genuine connect, have I got a genuine connection with them? Do they actually care about me? Because I know that I know the answers to those questions for my situation.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3501s)

And also for anybody that's in there, even if you don't answer yes to all the questions, you know, it's just yes to some of the questions, have a good long hard think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3513s)

And I think too, you know, the starting up of these podcasts have triggered a lot of chats and discussions about the brethren and about leaver stories from recent times and from many years ago. And inevitably, that may or may not put a certain pressure on the brethren, I don't know. But what is really going to change in the brethren is if people inside say, "I have had enough of this." And it's not that I'm saying they abandon their Christian faith, they don't even have to abandon their meetings, there's nothing wrong with all of that. But I've had enough of this level of control in my life. And actually, if it comes from within, that will be the most powerful.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3557s)

I agree with you Jacky, I've said right from when I left, I said, I've said to every people I've met, I said, "look, we can put pressure on from the outside, but it's going to come from the inside when it does."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3571s)

No it has to come from the inside and only the brethren can do that. And it won't be the leaders, it will be the brethren, the people we know and love that do that.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3580s)

Yeah, the rank and file.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3581s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3583s)

Just after we left, I was in contact with a beautiful person and he or she begged me, like begged me to change what was going on in there. And I don't have that power, you know, it took me a couple of months to realize I don't have that power, but I don't have that power, I'm a nobody. And change is going to come from within there. And for anyone that's watching this, you could be the one to change that. You might, you might do it alone for a while.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3629s)

I remember somebody I know that, non-brethren, it was Dr. Alex Stein actually, who was in a cult and it was not a religious cult, it was a political one and it was very controlling. But the point of what I'm saying is she had her doubts, she joined it as an adult, but she had her doubts. She wrote about it in her book and she said the breakthrough to her leaving was when she was with another member of the cult [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3661s) they dared to express their doubts to each other. Because I think there's a lot of brethren in there feeling unhappy, but they think everybody else is okay. And if they realize that actually there's a lot of people in there who are not okay, that's where the strength will come from within to make the change, won't it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3685s)

Yeah, I mean, sorry Ross, go on.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3689s)

I was just gonna say, as you said earlier Abi, you know, you may have to trot on your own for a while, but be sure there are others in there that are thinking the same and they will join you.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3699s)

Yeah, I know of one man who is married with children and you know, his wife and children are fully like brainwashed to the point where it's painful. And he would leave if it wasn't for his wife and children because [he'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3729s) lose them. And that's really sad because that's what happens, family gets ripped apart because of this twist of the doctrine of separation.

You know, I spoke to our pastor about it and I said, "so what's your sort of take on separation?" I was quite defensive, to be fair to the poor bloke, but I said, "what's your like take on separation?" Because you know, brethren believe it's separation from the world and separation from evil. So I said, "how are you separate from the world? Because you're in the world." The poor guy. And he said, "no, we're still separate from evil, we don't involve ourselves in evil just because [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3777s) don't segregate ourselves, doesn't mean that we don't separate."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3787s)

I totally agree and I've said this, I've said it publicly before, I don't think anybody, myself included, would disagree with separating from evil, but that's not separating from people. And the brethren themselves agreed that separation is moral, not physical. That's what they agreed with the Charity Commission. They did indeed. And the very, very fact, that's what they actually put in their statement in the deed of variation, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3817s) say separation is more moral than physical. And if that's what the brethren did and practiced, I'd totally agree with them because you could sit with somebody that you know has done bad things and you don't agree with it, but that doesn't, sitting with them and having a cup of coffee with them doesn't mean you condone what they do, does it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3840s)

No, but it's also none of your business. It's between you and God. It's between the person and God.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D3847s)

Yes, I agree. Yeah, yeah. No, Jesus had to do with all people from all walks of life. Now we can't claim to be anything like Jesus, but oh, I certainly can't anyway, maybe you can, I can't.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3871s)

B[ut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3871s) stop laughing\!

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3873s)

I'm glad Gilli is laughing, so I didn't know whether to or not, but yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3882s)

But that's who we should try and be like.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3888s)

Yeah, and it's that thing that I keep coming back to is on their words say that separation is moral and not physical. What's happened to your husband and his family, Abi? What's happened to Gilli and his family, Ross and his family, me and my brother? Physical separation.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3910s)

The word Christian means, it literally means Christ-like, and the brethren are so far removed from that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3918s)

Yeah, so am I, you know, I'm a sinner. I couldn't be anything like Jesus if I tried, you know, he's a sinless person. But you know, as a church, the doctrines which they're trying to instill in people are so un-Christ-like and that's a massive, you know, red flag. It's really scary because they're saying they're a Christian church, they're blinking not.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3956s)

That's only the veneer on the front, isn't it? It is just so...

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3960s)

What did, what happened in the Charity Commission? Did the Charity Commission believe that?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=3966s)

Yes. So in a word, the Charity Commission accepted that the brethren were there for charitable purposes. They were concerned, they did, they were concerned about the level of harm because in charitable law, if it can be proven the level of harm outweighs the charitable good that a charity does, then their charitable status will be in threat. The Charity Commission were concerned about the level [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4000s) harm and the level of harm is listed in that document, but it's things like separating family, isolation, the practice of shutting up, all those sorts of things. Sexual abuse didn't even come into it actually, interestingly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D4018s)

Yeah, because there was a huge big carpet there, I think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpJe1kDi4NoA%26t%3D4021s)

And they wrote up what they call the Deed of Variation and the Deed of Variation was incorporated into every [gospel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4031s) hall trust of every brethren trust and it sets out how they see their faith working in practice.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4039s)

Oh yes, I remember getting the "Faith in Practice" book now you say.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4042s)

Yeah. So but the interesting thing is, the Charity Commission told us that they would expect the trustees of every trust to make sure that members are fully aware and live by those, separation being moral not physical, people being allowed to make contact, maintain contact with families when they leave if they want to, and steps being taken to keep up contact with children when a parent leaves and all those things.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4070s)

And that's what I was sucked in by. I completely believed it. That's why I thought, you know, we're going to leave, my husband isn't going to be completely ostracized from his family.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4083s)

Yeah, and the way the brethren get around it, they say, "well, it's an individual matter." It's not an individual matter as to whether people have anything to do with their families or not.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJe1kDi4NoA&t=4096s)

Bruce's family, from what I picked up, would be terrified to speak to him for fear of them being reprimanded themselves and that's super sad. You know, we're not horrible people. Like yes, we've all got our differences and you know, families are families as I said and yeah, I'll leave it there on that one. But no, we're not evil people.

No, we're not. No

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
