## Summary

“To err is human, but to really f#@k things up you need the Plymouth Brethren” – and in the case we report today, they come in the person of Simon Filleul, a Plymouth Brethren elder and Rapid Relief team spokesman from Whanganui, New Zealand. Simon’s business, Playground Centre Limited took on a talented and enthusiastic 19-year old, exploited his energy and loyalty to the utmost extreme for 7 years, lured him to Australia with false and unfulfilled promises of training, promotion and financial assistance, then finally, having extracted everything of value from him, left him to die alone, hanging from his forklift truck. Yes, we are angry and sickened by the greed, cruelty, and hypocrisy of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and its fake Rapid Relief Team Charity – and yes , it’s a bloody long podcast –but if you are, like the Filleuls, one of those smug, self-important callous money-grubbing UBT trained PBCC businessmen you need to sit yourself down and watch this podcast again, and again and again…because if YOU f#@k up, it will be your proud, respectable Brethren name on the next episode of Get-a-Life Podcast.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast.

On November 29th, 2023, Sam Keast was found deceased at his workplace, hanging from this forklift truck with a green ratchet strap around his neck. Sam was just 27, a carpenter employed by Whanganui New Zealand Business, Playground Centre Limited. 

The business is owned and run by a wealthy Plymouth Brethren Christian Church family, the Filleuls. The two directors of the business are CEO Simon and his father Dennis. Simon and [Dennis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=42s) Filleul are both representatives of the Brethren's Rapid Relief Team charity. On November the 22nd, 2023, just one week before Sam died, the Rapid Relief Team published an article proclaiming their support for the mental health of construction workers. Here's what it says.

“ It's a disturbing reality that every day we lose two construction workers to suicide. The demands of the industry make it a difficult one to work in, with it being notoriously [challenging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=72s) both physically and mentally. The long hours, tight deadlines, time away from family, lack of job security and high-risk environments being only a few of the factors contributing to the challenges faced by hard-hat workers on a daily basis. Data shows that those in the industry are nearly four times more likely to take their own lives than workers in other sectors.”

“RRT's Construction Community Connect campaign was fabricated out of our desire to help make a difference to the lives of those in the industry.”

Ten years previously after decades of public notoriety and scandal, the Exclusive Brethren were threatened with losing their charitable status. In desperation, they hired top public relations experts and rebranded as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church with a shiny new slogan, Compassion in Action. 

The Rapid Relief Team charity, RRT, was the centerpiece of their new identity. In this investigative podcast, we take a can opener to the shiny, polished [face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=137s) of the Plymouth Brethren and expose both the deep hypocrisy of the cult and Playground Centre's cruel exploitation of a good and loyal employee, Sam Keast. Follow along with us as we show with extensive documentary evidence how Simon Filleul, a Plymouth Brethren elder and Rapid Relief Team spokesman, literally worked Sam Keast to death.

Happy New Year, everyone. Welcome back to Get a Life Podcast. I am Cheryl, and with me today is Richard Marsh. We are both ex-members of the Exclusive Brethren, now rebranded the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. We have four very special guests joining us today, and we bring you a story that is both heartbreaking and deeply troubling. This podcast touches on a very sensitive subject but one that we feel needs to be opened up. Viewer discretion is advised.

 Sam Keast was a dedicated [worker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=215s) sent across borders to build a new division for his Plymouth Brethren Christian Church employer, Simon Filleul. Sam was alone, under immense pressure and ultimately overwhelmed. 

A year ago his family's world was shattered when Sam was found deceased at the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church workplace in Melbourne. Despite the tragic circumstances, WorkSafe wasn't informed by the employer, only the police were. Now as WorkSafe investigates at a painfully slow pace, questions remain unanswered [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=245s) the role his employer played in Sam's death. Joining us today are Sam's sister Serena, their father and mother Harley and Raewyn, and Tristam who is a 2019 co-founder and current editor of a legal think-tank that researches and reports unemployment law and occasionally anti-money laundering. Sounds like Tristam you could have an endless supply of stories if you stuck with us.

Serena, Harley and Raewyn and Tristan will share Sam's story, his life, his struggles and what they believe led to his tragic end. Welcome everyone.

I know that this is a very hard podcast to do and every ex-member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church send their deepest sympathies for the tragedy that occurred here. We can't change the outcome but we sure as hell can raise some noise and awareness of this incessant issue that happens within this cult. We have an incredible amount of receipts here, including voice messages, Sam's last search on workplace negligence, news articles, and we have had many complaints over the years brought our way from insiders and non-community [members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=310s) on the way some of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church handle their workload and commitments. I want to start off by you guys telling us a little bit about Sam's background first. When did he first start working for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church company?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=325s)

Hi Cheryl. Yeah, Sam started working for them back in May 2018\. He did a carpentry course at  Polytech.

And either through that, he got contact with the company or he just answered an ad or not quite sure they call him a playground technician I'm not entirely sure what that is I think just a general factory worker.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=362s)

 Yeah I think he explained himself as like a hammer hand just on the floor doing whatever labor needed to be done.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=368s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=370s)

Yeah and inwards and dispatch and…

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=374s)

I'm not sure of the sequence. He was either a general hand on the floor first and then went to dispatch or the other way around.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=386s)

And he's basically building large play structures and playground equipment such as goes in public parks and schools. What sort of age was he then?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=399s)

Um I'm gonna do some quick maths I'll say eight years ago 19 19 20\.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=407s)

He was 19 okay so this was yeah one of his first jobs.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=410s)

Yeah yeah prior to that he'd been down in Wellington uh yeah being a being a ratbag working in hospitality chefing working in bars stuff.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=426s)

And then he met Denny and Annie's parents live in Whanganui so they moved there for the extra support and everything and settled in to Whanganui.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=438s)

Yeah they had a couple of wild years and then they settled into proper employment and as I say did this course and then got the job and yeah was going from there before he went to or sorry before they unfortunately separated yeah he was they were hell bent on buying a house in in Whanganui [unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=468s) circumstances prevented that.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=471s)

But Sam always had ideas of moving up up he wanted more than anything he wanted to get off the floor into the office. And he knew that would take a little while to get there. And he was under the opinion that he would be supported through that.

When the first words started being spoken about Melbourne and opening a branch there, he was quite excited because they said that they would send him on a project manager course.

That never happened.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=506s)

Just for the listeners and viewers, Sam started off in New Zealand and then they sent him to Melbourne to open up another division, which is where everything kind of went south from there. So, yeah, he's in New Zealand at this point. And what was did he enjoy his like, was he happy there working for them at the beginning?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=526s)

He did. He loved the job. He really enjoyed the job.

He's very creative. so that the freedom of well within design constraint the freedom of being able to build sort of not free form but not a box.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=551s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=551s)

It was was interesting to him yeah to build a a climbing frame of a unusual shape was what he liked to do he's very very artistic he uh actually started well actually even when he was at school he was heavily involved in the the Warhammer miniature… one of his

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=582s)

One of his little miniatures here that sits with me in my eyes. Like Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=591s)

And he would sit for hours painting these things that are, you know, no more than an inch tall, and he would paint them in a very intricate detail. He actually started a club in Whanganui for this Warhammer thing where they do, you know they play tabletop battles.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=614s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=615s)

Um and yeah that's that's the the level of artistic ability that he had and it that led into what he was doing the the play.. as I say the playground stuff he wasn't just building boxes and things it was all sort of creative and imaginative big they're they were not tiny they were massive no tree houses yeah yeah they've actually just [installed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=646s) one here in Tauranga and I believe the main structure is something like three stories high.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=655s)

They've been getting a lot of contracts here in new outer suburbs to build huge playgrounds you know out in these developing areas which is terrifying because you know I I know one of the schools a nurse that I work with has children there and you know it's just the the schools don't realize uh the ethics behind the business the whole importing cheap rubbish from China and making it look like it's come from New Zealand and Australia.

You know it's just the the reputation isn't there it's just they just look like a shiny you know company that does good for kids [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=702s) yeah that's most of the…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=704s)

Yeah the marketing is excellent I mean there were there was an article a few years back where they put up a new structure I think was about 16 feet tall with these tube slides and kids got injured on it and they say they were saying oh yeah well you know it doesn't really matter and kids get hurt when they play and an attitude there that just I felt pretty uncomfortable with yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=730s)

Yeah sorry it's just popped into my head I don't believe if there was any articles on it if there was it would only be local they built a playground for a new shopping center The Lakes here in Tauranga and it was opened and then shut down very quickly for that reason that kids it was deemed too dangerous .

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=755s)

It was built on a slope like that with stairs and then a slide and kids there was so steep kids were actually falling down and this is Simon's company…

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

…that we're talking about again the same company yeah Sam said it was yeah yeah I'd have to go back and think.

### **Raewyn [Keast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=771s)**

I don’t think much was publicized about it but it was kept pretty quiet unless you knew Sam told us so I think the main part of the job Cheryl that that Sam was supposed to be doing was fixing all of the problems that the Australian clients had with uh structures that they already had installed.

And then he was expected to do the factory on top of that and the distances that he was having to travel uh you know [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=801s) from one sub to another suburb to another here in in Melbourne is you know you can be driving for an hour as opposed to Tauranga you know you're driving 15 minutes so these people have no idea what they're asking of him when they say oh can you just pop out to Wheeler Hill and and check out this you know…

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=824s)

And then he was being asked to do things he wasn't qualified to do like fixing water pumps and things as well it was just you know whatever they needed doing that was his job.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=833s)

And he was their only representative in Australia yeah yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=838s)

And the office woman in in the New Zealand branch acknowledged that and tried to make sure that he was looked after but you know…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=849s)

Yeah let's step back a little bit I just want to lay this out for the listeners and viewers so they know that they can follow along with what we're talking about so Sam starts off in New Zealand right and they come to him about this job opportunity of starting up this the same another division in Melbourne Australia right and he goes there a couple times to scope things out that's if I'm remembering correctly right Serena like he comes a couple times…

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=873s)

Something happened before then so Sam had actually approached his bosses to say that he was thinking of leaving okay moving on to something else and that's when they offered him the move to Melbourne.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=886s)

Gotcha and what did he vocalize what it was that he was why he was wanting to leave back then before he went to Melbourne did he

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=894s)

I don't think so he was too scared to say anything about you know I mean there was lots of stuff he was the factory was dangerous the co-workers weren't being listened to just you know they could see what kind of materials were being used and how inappropriate things were and he just wasn't willing to be part of it.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=914s)

Yeah and he's as I said before he loved the work absolutely loved it but the the management and procedural stuff that was going on was of concern.

He had said to us a couple of times that you don't really pay a lot of attention to it at the time, you know, it's sort of a, oh, he crushed his finger in a container door, um which seemed to be very they seem to have a very blasé attitude towards they just we'd oh yeah sort of put a plaster on it and carry on Sam's work ethic would have been very similar however you know if you're not dead carry on.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=971s)

Yeah but this crushed finger ended up with an operation of three months of work full three months of work rehabilitation.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=982s)

I don't know if he stopped work that day or even visited a doctor but uh yeah it went on to course as like surgical it had to be repaired surgically.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1005s)

Wow so he was off work for uh three months on ACC did you see yeah yeah yeah okay that's serious.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1016s)

Yeah and what like so when they were…

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1019s)

…notified to WorkSafe.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1021s)

It must have gone through WorkSafe and I believe that if an employee is injured or suffers something like this and then has another incident of some sort they the company do become more uh even more liable to things especially like mental health.

And I think the way that they make themselves look like they operate out of Brisbane really confuses people or puts consumers off the scent they were at a convention last year you know propping themselves up as an Australian based company.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1068s)

Yes. They put a Facebook post about their Australian team, which…

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1075s)

…didn't exist.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1077s)

Yeah.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1078s)

That is good marketing. I don't think that's necessarily deceptive.

I think Australians would rather buy from what they think is an Australian company. And I don't think there's any evasiveness or deceit going on there. It's a company that started off wherever in New Zealand, looking to expand, and that's how they're marketing to Australian clients.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4834s)

The ironic part is, though, is that the Australian team, though, was just Sam, right?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1115s)

Yeah. Yeah.

That's some serious puffery. Right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1123s)

Yeah, that's the point that we're trying to angle in on here is that this Australian team was Sam and Sam.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1134s)

Yeah, if the far side collapses, then, well, the company's got to pick out the pieces.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4834s)

Yeah. How did they prepare him for this job? Like, what did they, did he have courses he had to take? What did he have to do in order to get ready for this switch?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1152s)

Yeah get a passport that's it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4834s) 

So they didn't give him any extra training like they didn't offer any extra training for him.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1159s)

Oh they told him they'd do a project management course and did he ever do it? No,no.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1167s)

What about a forklift license in Victoria?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1171s)

No nothing and a…

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1173s)

Half day course.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1174s)

Not one

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1175s)

No, one day in New Zealand two and a half days in Victoria right yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1179s)

He asked constantly and he kept getting just ignored.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1182s)

Yeah okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4834s)

Here's some pictures of what his big bay and the forklift that he was using and also a video he made when he got to his place so here's the video of him explaining his new kingdom I believe that's what he called it.

### [**Sam Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1198s)

Check it out, it's my factory. Right in there. It's also my car. It's kind of shit. Should have been a double cab, but oh [well. He](http://well.He) decided to be stingy about it.

Got the foyer. Upstairs to the offices, or office rather. There's not exactly any room in here. Just one big floor. That's what I'll be doing in the first week, setting up the computers and all that. Good ol' smacker room. If I can find the fucking light. Need to sort out a fridge. Toilets and then floor. Welcome to my kingdom\! Got a bit of setting up to do but yeah, big old factory.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1301s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1303s)

Yeah oh he was very proud.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1306s)

Very very.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1307s)

Very.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1307s)

Yeah you can hear it in his voice yeah you very much it's a huge day for him yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1313s)

Exactly so let's go on so he gets to Melbourne how did his whole uh accommodations arrangement go for him like did they did they find him a place to live or did they did he have to do that?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1326s)

So earlier on he had been over for two secondments and based he was put in accommodation close to whatever factory he was going to be working in so I think he did one in the eastern suburbs and one in the western suburbs and they would put he him and his colleague there would always be two of them.

They would come into the airport they'd get a hire ute and then that ute they'd transfer themselves over to wherever they were staying which was always you know a cheap motel near the work site.

They got a meal allowance and that was it really they went to work they basically worked you know 12 hour days they worked as much as they could to be able to get the work done in the two-week [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1379s) frame they were given because there was absolutely no way anything was going to get extended.

So he did that during the weeks he got exactly you know completely exhausted and then the weekends I'd go and pick him up and bring him back to my place and he'd you know we'd do Melbourne life and he'd go out and explore the inner suburbs and you know go out to club nights and meet new friends and you know he was so excited you know this was the first time he'd ever experienced [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1409s) like this it's a bit like Wellington where he spent a lot of his I guess younger adult time you know uh he loved the alternative lifestyle he's a bit of a bohemian and Melbourne's inner suburbs really suited him.

 You know uh he he had amazing conversations with my son Taika they both Sam and Taika were a neurodivergent and they you know struck up this amazing [friendship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1440s) and you know that that was about it you know. 

So when he got here for his permanent stay they had shipped up or packed up all of his belongings into a couple of shipping containers, oh no, one shipping container so they shared it, they put tools and whatever else the business needed and then they also threw in a bunch of Sam's personal belongings because he was moving over permanently.

 That [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1470s) held up along the way somewhere I believe it was only three or four days that they confirmed accommodation which was an Airbnb in a suburb in the west in the west of Melbourne which was like a three-bedroom family home with the expectation that when co-workers came over to Melbourne to help out with any big jobs Sam would host them.

So he would go and so they're not even his [job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1500s) right? He'd go to the airport he'd pick them up he'd make sure they were fed he'd look after them make sure everything make sure they knew how to get around Melbourne and they were getting to all the places that they needed and they need to clean up after them and drop them back off at the airport and off they went and he was stuck at the Airbnb you know continuing his usual day-to-day drag whatever that was.

He was in that accommodation for maybe two months total before the family get got back from their [holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1530s) I guess of note is this area of Melbourne very industrial there's the sort of separated into industrial factories and then big huge multi-generational homes we have a lot of Indian and Chinese families who have say three generations living in one home that's the kind of thing that Sam was living in.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1551s)

Yeah I should, we should remind people so Serena lives in Melbourne so you were able you were already living in Melbourne when he was being transferred there which made it a little bit easier because he had a connection there.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1561s)

Right yeah so one of one of the first questions they asked him is , do you have any family that could put him up for a while until they found something like that's how difficult they were finding it to find accommodation and that's as a business being able to you know sign up for a business.

 [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1578s)

Yeah Harley and Raewyn you are in New Zealand right so that's how this was working yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1584s)

We're we're four five hours away from so I've just been quickly Googling just to give you an idea of the comparison between the three places that Sam's really been. Whanganui where he was working for Playground Centre population was 49,000.

So it's small, smaller than where we are actually.

Wellington 400,000 is the rough population there, so you can get an idea of the scale of there.

Melbourne 5.3 million.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1625s)

Yeah, it's a huge city.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1627s)

Yeah. So it's, you know, for them to sit in Whanganui and say, oh, can you just pop over to that suburb and you know fix that item um…

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1638s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1639s)

They had no idea.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1641s)

So even before the accommodation, sorry I'm just trying to get my thoughts in the right order they so very early on  they were throwing around the idea of uh leasing a factory somewhere near where Sam would would be living, so it the whole idea was Sam can move and live in Melbourne and then they would find a workshop because we have industrial areas everywhere, even my [suburb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1671s) and I live six kilometers from the city.

So they never put any thought into the geography of Melbourne the you know where life happens, where's public transport is, none of that uh was taken into account and basically they've just gone and looked for a cheap warehouse wherever and that and then Sam is forced to live somewhere close to that place, which turns out to be [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1702s) I can't remember where it was, at Altona North or something like that, but basically in a place he can't afford in a share house which is going you know he's going five ten years backwards in his life progress.

 He didn't want to live in a share house you know it was a huge bruise to his ego that he wouldn't be able to have his own home.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1723s)

That they provided the, they paid for his accommodation in the Airbnb but once that ended were they paying for his accommodation in where we moved to next or how did that work out?

### [**Raewyn Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1738s)

They would supply him at Airbnb for three months from memory and once that finished as long as and he would as Serena said look after the other people who came through the doors and do everything for them cook their meals everything and then he was he was told that would happen and after that they would pay 25% of his rent once he had to move into a rental situation.

The Airbnb, as Serena said, was reduced to two months. And then when he asked about the percentage of his rent, it was all yeah ignored and forgotten and that wasn't mentioned and yeah so he did struggle as Serena will say on getting a and he asked a lot like every time he was dealing with payroll and with Simon and I mean Shannon [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1796s) even know what he was getting paid, no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1801s)

And let's explain to the listeners of yours who Shannon is at this point in time.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1803s)

Uh so Shannon describes himself as Sam's friend and pseudo manager. They worked on the shop floor for years and years together according to Sam's ex-wife, you know they're pretty much on par in terms of skill and you know capability so Shannon was put in charge I think of the Australian operations without [knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1836s) a lot about Australia and without any kind of qualification and it was put in charge of Sam and Sam you know that that's the only person he had to contact because anyone that was brethren wouldn't answer his phone calls.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1857s)

I think I think you sent us some messages where Simon who's the business owner says, oh don't come to me with these problems send it all through send it all through Shannon, you know basically just shrugging off responsibility for for Sam in every way.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1876s)

Yeah yeah and yet Shannon never had like an official managerial role or title.  He was just Shannon.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1884s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1886s)

And that tends to be one of the biggest complications that they have within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church companies right is people are just thrown on positions whether you have training or not . 

I mean you can think if you're a part of the Brethren you can have someone who just graduates from school get thrown into a managerial position that has no experience on it with all these experienced people behind but underneath them, and yet if they go to that person for help many times [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1916s) completely looked down on because that person is above you but yet has no experience about what he's doing, and so you would find this often in these companies where they just they're not qualified to be able to be doing the managerial position that they found themselves in.

And here's the message that Sam had received from Simon it's dated Friday November 17th and Simon says to Sam; 

“Hello Sam, just thought I would check and see how you got on with the rental options?”

And Sam responds;

“Hi Simon I've managed to find a place this week and preparing to move in this weekend it's a shared flat with a couple other blokes in Point Cook which is 20 minute drive to work. Very nice lads and one is in a very similar situation to me. [From](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1964s) Dargaville, his home company expanded to a factory in Truganina and sent him to manage it. Sound familiar? It's $1,235 per month. Can we talk about what sort of assistance I will get for when you have a moment?”

 And then this is the voicemail that Simon sent back to Sam.

### [**Simon Filleul**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=1981s)

“Hey Sam, hey that's cool. That's sort of like a big rock isn't it to get sorted and interesting like say a couple of similar blokes, of all places it's interesting it's pretty small, but yeah very good hey and then your question, d’you know, it's probably easiest if you keep channeling through Shannon all the sort of info like I said whether we what we can assist you with or not and then if you use him as your direct report then I can he can chat to me obviously there's makes it it's easier too isn't it but is that all right and then we can work through it?

Cheers have a great day mate.”

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2033s)

How do you effectively manage something like factory work for a brand new factory that hasn't even been checked over and set up properly how do I mean how do you set that how do you supervise that how do you make sure that's safe?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2048s)

And I want to reiterate again that he did not have his forklift training they did not get that for him even when he was asking for it right yeah He asked constantly.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2061s)

 Yeah. And he also asked for a basket for his forklift so he could, you know, he didn't have to stand on the forklift tines.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2068s)

Had there been an incident with the forklift, Sam would have been personally liable. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2075s)

Because of it. Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2076s)

And that was a concern.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2078s)

I think it's super important to remind Simon and Playground Centre of why Sam's place of work that he was at was unsafe. Here's a little video to watch on why forklifts shouldn't be used for standing on unsafely without a harness or a cage.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2136s)

Yeah, every company has a person in charge of a business undertaking under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015\. Now the New Zealand Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 is very close to the Australian legislation and it came out of the Pike River mine disaster where there was an explosion and 29 miners died, that was in 2010\.

And the CEO at the time skipped accountability. He fled to Australia, so he was out of reach of WorkSafe.

And so the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 puts more responsibility on a person in charge of a business undertaking. So I had to look at the company's office website of Urban Effects and Playground Centre, and they both have two directors, Dennis Filleul and Simon Filleul.

So they are the directors, whatever the fancy titles they want to give themselves, like CEO, they're the directors, they're the persons in charge of a business undertaking. They're responsible, ultimately, for the health and safety of their employees. And if Simon is fobbing off some serious concerns expressed by Sam to someone who's no more qualified than he is, then [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2230s) a serious breach. And there's signs of that.

And the fact that he, you know, he didn't, Sam didn't have a forklift. I understand he had a license to drive in New Zealand. So that's a bit of a, that's a no-brainer. If he's working in Whanganui and he's driving a forklift a few times a week then, if the company sent him on a one-day course and he got his license and they have to pay an annual fee and a refresher, that's the cost of doing business. And they're getting good value for money because he's the driver.

Maybe not the only driver, but that is a no-brainer. But then he goes across to Australia and that requires, to get a license requires a two-and-a-half-day course. And that's the cost of doing business in Australia. Yeah and if Playground Centre had planned to set up shop in Melbourne they should have just accepted the cost and sent him on that course I failed to do that that's a serious breach [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2297s) exposed Sam to uh you know if he'd been caught or if WorkSafe had turned up they could have slapped him with a three thousand dollar fine he was going to pay for that yes do you think I suspect not he would have probably had to borrow off Serena so…

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2314s)

Yeah so that was that was his biggest concern now he did go and get his driver's license he was in possession of a Victoria driver's license as opposed to an international or or just doing nothing yeah he's got three months.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2335s)

He knew he knew he didn't need to do his driver's license straight away but he chose to because he wanted to explore and you know get around, very well he liked things done yeah yeah yeah but they the company didn't help him do that, they didn't allow him time to have any breathing space. He flew to Melbourne for the last time and had to start work straight away on on the Monday or whatever, there was [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2366s) time allowed to go and get his license to open a bank account to do any of life's little chores, to see what he needed to do they didn't guide him through all that, obviously they didn't know yeah, he turned up to the empty factory that's shown in the video down to computers in a corner that he was expecting lawn chairs.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2394s)

Yeah I saw there was two lawn chairs yeah yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2397s)

And he's expected to set up the whole office and get that up and running and do everything involved in an office all the paperwork and everything else, no training at all as well as the workshop and then going out on site and…

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2413s)

One thing that Tristan may be able to comment on further is I did it it just sort of dawned on me in the past week in regards to health and safety, is in all the photos and videos that Sam sent me I cannot recall seeing any signage in regards to health and safety.

Now I know [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2443s) know it's it's here it's you know you have to wear this, you have to do that, you can't go over here, don't drink that it's poisonous, yeah there was no absolutely nothing on any wall any surface anywhere.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2458s)

I think their idea happens if the same was telling them where the nearest medical scene to what he was asked he was told to go and find out one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2471s)

Recording of that message yes here's the recording of that message so you understand what they're talking about, yeah telling him to find where the nearest medical center is in case he hurt himself.

### [**Simon Filleul**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2483s)

“Yeah that's good Sam yep you need to uh suss out those things also it might be worth sussing out where the nearest medical center is too just to just a bit of forward thinking you know for instance when at some stage if you need to make a doctor's appointment or you know if there was a if if you did have an accident of some type so just so you know you know roughly where to go would be probably worthwhile at some [stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2513s). 

Cheers Sam have a good day, enjoy the settling in.”

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2517s)

He’s probably scared of the bosses. 

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2521s)

Yeah but they all were, yeah Sam would mention that that they would all watch what they said yeah, watch, they knew never to mention “union” or “overtime” they they knew, no overtime, never.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2537s)

So with the payslips that you sent me Serena, did he work past those hours that he claimed ...

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2546s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2546s)

Those are completely fabricated.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2548s)

Yep.

So he would send I think it's Cherry just a breakdown of their hours that that they worked, but they were written so that they would be specifically what he was supposed to be working. It wasn't what he was actually working.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2567s)

I've got messages saying that he's worked all weekend on jobs or, you know, had to pull all-nighters to get stuff done. And did he get paid extra for that? No, no, no, no, no, never. No way. They didn't want to know about that. He's not even allowed to document that he worked that long.

No he wasn't allowed to mention it or anything.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2588s)

Yeah I I'd be quite interested to know you know ,within a within a reasonable margin what hours he was actually working whether that be on driving between sites or doing the only computer or driving yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2605s)

I've been having to think about it over the last few months and I think if we had access to the security system for the factory we may be able to find out when he was entering and leaving yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2619s)

Uh yeah let's talk about this, let's talk about the surveillance that was supposed to go up and never ever did, let's talk about this.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2630s)

Yeah they told us there would be video surveillance. Well Sam told us, he was told because he was going to be on his own they would put cameras around so if anything happened they'd see it on camera.

So he was under the belief that someone was, had cameras and they were watching and they could see them and just keeping an eye  on him and if anything did happen that yeah he'd be able to wave and [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2660s) camera would pick him up and someone would then know. 

They did admit further along I think it was the night they found Sam that the police said something about cameras and they said ,oh no they're not up and going yet and this was three months plus after he'd been there, and there was one one camera working and it was in the reception area poking out \- because that's how they picked up that Sam's ute hadn't been moved.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2693s)

Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's what I, sorry, I'll just scuttled off just to try and find…

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2697s)

Yeah, that's the one camera, but for the workshop and no, they said, oh no, that's not hooked up and working yet. Whether that's true or they just didn't want it, we don't know. If it even existed in the first place.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2713s)

Yeah and this is just a little clip here from the investigation that went on this is sentence number 23;

“ Darcy was advised that the CCTV at the warehouse were not operational yet because they only recently commenced operations at this warehouse not long ago Darcy is a relative of Simon's who found Sam's body. Sam was under the impression that the CCTV cameras were already up and operational.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2740s)

 I mean just for the benefit of people who are listening to this podcast and not actually watching the video if you can imagine a large kind of high bay factory floor where you're assembling structures out of telephone pole size pieces of wood very heavy very long pieces of wood to build up structures maybe up to two or three stories tall in some cases.

One person working on their own using a forklift as a crane with a strap over the tine to lift these pieces of wood, I mean just imagine how difficult that is for one person ,they have to lift up one end of the piece of wood and then climb up on something I don't know what and bolt that on and then they've got to go around the forklift and lift up the other end of the piece of wood and then try and go and attach that. 

You're working at heights you're working with heavy machinery [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2797s) huge potential for falls, there's huge potential to get your arm or your hand trapped, it it almost looks impossible for one person to be to be doing that physically.

 I mean it would, it seems so illogical because it would have been so much more efficient to have two people working on a construction when you're when you're moving pieces of timber of that size and weight and then to not even have a man-carrying basket on the forklift?

 I mean I worked for two years [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2827s) a very large bakery that was full of heavy machinery and every morning you started the day with a meeting with your manager where you discuss safety, every single morning without any, there was no excuse for not being at the morning safety meeting and they would go over every incident that had happened in that factory or in any of their other locations in Canada \-  even if someone had just cut their finger you would be told about it and told [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2858s) and why it had happened.

And I remember one day some of the maintenance staff had to access something on the ceiling and they were in a hurry and they just put a skid, they put a pallet on a forklift times and they lifted a guy up standing on the pallet,, and that team of three maintenance staff were fired on the spot because that's a serious breach of safety regulations to be lifted up to to use a forklift, to lift a person without having [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2888s) proper man-carrying basket with a rail around it that's how… yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2893s)

I think also Tristan you may know over a specific height which isn't much I think it's only maybe three meters uh you're also required to have a harness.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2906s)

Yeah yeah that sounds about right I haven't done much uh working at heights I've only had both license for uh briefly for about 20 years ago I only use it I'm pretty sure...

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2920s)

Yeah I'm pretty sure from where I work if yeah so you know two or three meters the cage is fine yeah beyond that cage and harness yeah ,that's right.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2933s)

So do you know did they ever write a safety assessment? Before work started in the new facility like do you guys know if they ever did that? 

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2947s)

No they said it would have been Sam doing it and he wasn't trained in that.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2954s)

He the first person to go to the factory. No one else went there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2956s)

Yeah. I looked up the Australian regulations, and if you're working with heavy machinery or working at height or with hazardous substances, the law says you must do a written formal safety assessment before anyone starts work. And all three of those would have applied in that case. Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2975s)

I'm a nurse, and I have to do that before I go into each person's house. And that's not a dangerous situation, you know? Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2983s)

Was there plans to bring more people there like were they planning on bringing more people there or was the thing yeah we're gonna start the whole thing?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2989s)

Look did you see how many computers were in that factory like there was a lot yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=2999s)

I went through everything that you guys sent me and I mean I had to take breaks from it because it's very, I mean, I, my heart just goes out for you guys because there was, he seemed like such an eager worker right let's just impressed let's do this let's he just wanted to be productive yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3016s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3017s)

And you're going through all this stuff and you're like okay so you're how many months into this and yet the staff isn't there and they're still got him building what he's building like, you guys have seen the pictures on here.

 I mean these are massive things that he's building all by himself whilst trying to set up a life in Melbourne on top of it, whilst trying to find accommodation, while still trying to do everything that you need to do. We're not just moving to a different city in the same country. We [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3047s) to completely a different... We're now in Australia. It's a whole different world

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3052s)

The cost of living is incredible. The transport around the city. Just getting to know where things are and how things work. So completely different.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3065s)

Let's go over some of the employer duties that were in his New Zealand work contract. So the first one says;

Providing and maintaining a safe work environment for employees and others in the workplace. 

The next one is providing and maintaining facilities for the welfare of the employee while at work.

 Providing all necessary training and instructions to employees. Making sure machining equipment is safe. 

Making sure working arrangements are not hazardous. 

[Providing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3096s) procedures to deal with work emergencies, making sure health and safety employee engagement and participants processes are in place.

 And the last one, consulting and cooperating with other business operating in the same workplace to keep everyone safe and healthy.

And for myself personally just reading all of those, you can pick out exactly which ones the employers is not even providing for the employee. 

And so from your guys's point of view what was his support like from Simon from the staff there what was the support like, I want the emotional and mental support, not even the physical support because we know the physical support really wasn't there but what kind of emotional and mental support did he receive [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3144s) doing a massive transition like that?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3148s)

It was non-existent. They only cared about the work.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3153s)

If they, yeah, he had multiple emails and messages unanswered and not acknowledged. Yeah, there was no support physically, emotionally, none at all.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3170s)

He had no one to turn to but Shannon. And Shannon, as we know, is out of his depth. He didn't know what he was doing.

And yeah no there was no support at all, looking for somewhere to live was just yeah that was very very hard on Sam,finding somewhere to live because at that stage they were paying him in New Zealand.

### [**Raewyn Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3192s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3193s)

So he didn't have an Australian bank account to show prospective landlords.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3200s)

Right yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3203s)

You know I believe without doing the math I believe that the lease on the BNB and the sharing  accommodation that he got like only overlapped by days had hehe not got that he would have had to be out of the BNB within less than a week.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3225s)

Yeah he was extremely extremely stressed about that and he was on to the company constantly to get help or for them to… just all he really wanted at the end of the day was to pay him in Australia so he could show a landlord an Australian bank account without that, nobody wanted to know.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3248s)

He did find someone who was kind-hearted enough to let him move into shared house so he got a bedroom…

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3260s)

Yeah I mean Serena had to back him up a lot like Serena had to give him the money for the bond. Yeah the company I mean in in my world the company should have stacked that up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3271s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3273s)

Front it up with the bond for him. 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3277s)

But I mean for someone who's now effectively a manager running their whole Australian operations it's a pretty low standard of living to be one bedroom in a shared house, you know you're sharing the bathroom you're sharing the kitchen yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3290s)

Yeah I want to go through some of the police statements that were sent in on exactly what we're really talking about here are the things that he was having issues with so this is part of the statement that Serena you gave and so it says I'm just going to go briefly through some of these;

“ On this last visit, he outlined the following concerns about work. 

Number one, he did not know if work would continue with a plan to subsidize his housing. Sam had told me previously that with [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3320s) rate of pay he was earning, he expected Playground Centre to contribute at least $300 per month toward his living cost to make the move to Melbourne financially viable.

 Number two, he'd been moved to Australian payroll but didn't know what his pay rate was. 

Number three, he struggled to get information out of Simon, Playground Centre CEO, about what his employment entitlements were. 

Number four, Sam needed extra hands to get all the work done within the time frames demanded. He had been discussing hiring a casual contractor assistant [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3351s) work had said yes. Nothing had been done about it though. Sam worked with heavy timber, power tools and a forklift daily. He needed a second person to keep up with scheduled demands and safety.

 Number five, I asked Sam how he put together such big pieces of timber together without a second person. He remarked that he used the forklift, which he was not licensed to drive in Australia, and just got on with it. I asked what happens if he hurts himself.

 He said that his company installed a camera in the factory to keep an eye on him remotely. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3381s) was their way of ensuring his safety on site. Sam joked about some of his workmates getting workplace injuries. Sam himself had injured a finger requiring surgery a couple of years ago. Sam said it was not uncommon for workplace injuries to occur. I urged him to put my name down as his next of kin on all his paperwork, so if he was injured, if he had an allergic reaction, (Sam had a severe anaphylaxis allergy to nuts and avocado) and required hospitalization that I would be contacted. 

Sam told me that he and his workmates [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3411s) complained to management multiple times about the conditions they worked in New Zealand, but that nothing had come of it. 

Number six, Sam was having to drive long distances to work sites and suppliers. Sam didn't believe that his workplace understood the distances and time required to travel to these places. For example, he was traveling between Truganina and Rowville for his latest job. 

Number seven, my wife Valina had shown Sam an ad from Seek, which was advertising a similar role with a different company that offered better conditions and [pay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3441s)”

And on the screen, you'll see the screenshot from this conversation of where she handed over a link to a job here.

Sam's response was; 

‘Very tempting right now. I'm getting royally screwed over it feels.’

 And then the response says; 

‘Hopefully not, just so you know the equivalent here. When I moved out here in the beginning, I jumped up 10 to 15k in salary. Things are a bit different here.’

 And then the next screenshot you're going to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3474s) on the screen is an actual screenshot of some of the jobs that Sam was looking for. Here's, I'll read some of them out for the listeners. 

Hospitality jobs in Point Cook, Front of House, Melbourne, Hospitality All-Rounder, 264 Point Cook jobs in Point Cook, team member jobs at Nando's, crew member job at McDonald's, team member job at Porto, cook job in Point Cook Victoria, bartender job in Point Cook.

So this clearly lays out how he was unhappy and looking for another job.

Number eight. Sam told us he felt he owed the company he was a very loyal and honest person they had kindly allowed him to move some of his personal belongings in a shipping container with a business shipment.

 Number nine. I probed further about why he thought he needed to stay with them. He told me, I just need to trust that they are doing right by me and [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3533s) them another chance. 

Number 10, he outlined his plan to keep working until the holiday period. He'd be having two weeks off while the factory was closed over Christmas and New Year, then resigned after he'd had a chance to rest if he still wasn't happy. 

Number 11, I asked Sam how many hours he'd been working. He told me he averaged around 50 hours per week. I joked with him that he must be earning some good overtime. He said, no, this company doesn't do overtime. I asked if they gave him time in lieu, at least for the extra time he put in. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3563s) said, no, never. He told me that if his boss had heard him talking about overtime or unions, that he would be fired on the spot. I told him that he needed to look over his contract and make sure his company were at least maintaining the minimum Australian employment standards.

And it goes on to say, Sam was physically tired but very happy to have secured a room in a share house in Point Cook. Searching for long-term accommodation was a big stressor. He was under the impression that Playground Centre would be supporting him with accommodation for six months [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3594s) he had to find his own place. 

Although he lived and worked in Melbourne, Sam was being paid in New Zealand so could not prove he had Australian employment or income. I advised Sam when he first arrived in Australia that he needed to be on an Australian contract and getting paid in Australia. to be able to build up a credit history, superannuation, insurance, etc. He told me he was putting pressure on his employer to do this. Playground Centre had started paying him into an Australian bank account, but it was unclear whether they updated his employment location to Melbourne.”

And another extract from one of the police statements.

“Stressed with work. Felt not being listened to. Not financially reimbursed. Overworked and not paid the hours he'd been working or overtime acknowledged. Isolated in his workplace with no-one onsite to assist despite asking for help.

 Isolated and limited supports provided by his employer with relocating and setting up moving. Initial accommodation found from his work but Sam expressed some financial payment as per their agreement had [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3655s) been made prior to moving. He had worked for his employer for seven years, was a trusted employee initially excited by the move an opportunity to break into the Australian market with a New Zealand company. Sam upset by the lack of support with his employer despite his requests. States he was telling work over the phone about these issues but nothing had been done.”

And here's another one.

“Met Sam at Serena's house. Sam was there when I called in. This was the week prior to Melbourne Cup weekend in November. We previously had a conversation about how he was. He had mentioned some work difficulties with lack of support. His workplace not assisting with some costs with relocating and work supplies. Had used his own credit card for work supplies and relocation costs. So following up asked how work was going. Sam responded with things not improving. Express concerns over working all weekend recently, 10-hour days, nil support.

 [Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3707s) had put a new order in expecting an order to be done. Sam expressed stress at how this was impossible due to the equipment not being available. He stated he had no idea how this was going to happen. I tried to offer advice. If there was an email chain of what his work agreements to him were when arriving to Melbourne, states no. But a boss was also his friend, Jamie, and felt that Jamie would support him here in Melbourne. Sam was unaware of the PH coming up as Melbourne Cup. Serena and I advised to take the Monday off and have [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3737s) break. 

This would result in a four-day weekend. Sam expressed he had no idea of the PH was expected to work. Advised Sam to try and email his bosses in New Zealand regarding agreement and financial reimbursement he was owed. Sam expressed he felt like they were not listening. He came across as dejected during our conversation that nothing was being done. However, products, productions were expected, leaving Sam to work long hours and weekends alone. 

And I could go on and on with statement after statement that is [reiterating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3768s) the same narratives and same story of how we can tell that Sam was completely feeling unsupported, overworked, exhausted and not really having the resources to do the job that he was set out to do.”

So I think from here maybe we should just discuss his wages.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3785s)

Yeah he should have in that position he should have been earning I mean I looked up the kind of wages that you know what one I looked up, what's the average wage for a good carpenter in Melbourne and it says well they should be earning between you know anything from 50 to 100 an hour like for a good tradesman in Melbourne and and he was actually getting what was he getting 29 Australian.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3813s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3814s)

He would probably have been better off working for McDonald's.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3817s)

So the company said to him and I think it's written somewhere that we will give you the equivalent in Australian money to what you were earning in New Zealand.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3829s)

Yeah

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3832s)

 So he didn't get a pay rise basically and no over time as we said but the company didn't from what Sam said didn't allow him time personal time to take to look at any accommodation either. Instead of supporting that for him they just kept piling on more and more work and so he was trying to sort all of that and find somewhere to live without having the grace of time to take out be able to concentrate [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3863s) doing that they they just didn't, nothing came through that they even acknowledged that sort of stress on Sam.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3870s)

Yeah Serena you mentioned a while back that Sam was doing work that he wasn't qualified to do such as uh working on water pumps yeah, and I was just wondering if that's prescribed electrical work .

I'm an electrical service technician by trade and if he was if he was connecting and disconnecting water pumps for fountains and things and uh you know water slides that's uh that requires an electrician or at the very least an electrical technician and if he was doing that without being qualified or if he was expected to do that yeah and that's uh he was just doing whatever it was time to do.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3911s)

Can you comment Tristam on the minimum wage situation I mean there are regulations particularly in Australia around that aren't there?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3923s)

Yeah well the Australian minimum wage is about I don't know the exact amount at the moment or or what it was in 2023 but I think it was around $24 an hour Australian.

Here in New Zealand it's slightly less it's probably 10% less if you take into account the exchange rate maybe 15% less.

So when he was in New Zealand he was earning 28 New Zealand dollars an hour and then when he moved to Australia, he was earning 28 Australian dollars an hour, which equates to about $30.50 New Zealand. So you get an idea of the exchange rate, it's roughly 93 cents per dollar.

So they just, they didn't take into account the cost of living or the, you know, what a median wage might be in each country. And also the most significant thing, I think, was the hours that he was actually working pulled his real rate down below Australian minimum wage. So that would have been a breach of the Minimum Wage Act [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=3998s) the Australian equivalent.

Now, I worked out that he if he was treated as a New Zealand worker on a New Zealand contract but on secondment to Australia then Playground Centre narrowly avoided breaching the New Zealand Minimum Wage Act.

And I reached out to the Labour Inspectorate which is part of the Ministry of Business, innovation and employment.

And they said there was nothing they could do because it was just above, you know, maybe less than a dollar above the New Zealand minimum wage.

I think Playground Centre are more on the hook in Australia because, well, for a start, there's two agencies investigating, both in Australia, there's the coroner and WorkSafe Victoria.

And I think that you might be concerned that, you know, Sam is going to fall for a legal system.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4066s)

There will also be Morris Blackburn looking into a civil case as well.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4073s)

Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So what they'll be looking at, I think, is whether the estate of Sam has a claim against the company and what jurisdiction.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4092s)

And admittedly, I'll struggle to find what... It's actually not Sam's estate doing it. It's me, myself, personally. Sam didn't have any dependents. I have uh you know an executive nursing job that I no longer can do and probably never will be able to do again so that's the angle that we're taking and it's also about accountability

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4109s)

I mean why should they get away with it because Sam has passed away?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4116s)

Tristam did an incredible article I actually just want to pull up this article and go through it because it is such an incredible article so this article is on [leightonassociates.co.nz](http://leightonassociates.co.nz)  I'll post a link below in the description of the podcast but it's called “Ducking and weaving on both sides of the ditch” there's a beautiful picture of Sam blowing bubbles to a dog. Is this his dog?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4145s)

That's my dog that's your dog she's passed since as well so oh yeah this park is a little bit of a trigger for us unfortunately.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4160s)

Tristan if you could walk us through this article that you wrote because you really were able to point out some of the things that when Richard and I were going and uh digging into all of this you answered a lot of our questions.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4174s)

I'll tell you first how I learned about Sam. There was an article in the New Zealand Herald and that was I think the 3rd or 4th of October last year and I missed it. I didn't see it until a couple of days later when it was shared on LinkedIn and I believe Serena commented on it.

Yeah, that's it. So that's the Herald article. There was another one before that in Australia and that was written by Daniel Peters on the 24th of September.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4212s)

I've got to pull it up here.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4213s)

Right. So that's it? Yeah. Okay. So I didn't see that either until I read Ben Plummer's Herald article first. I'm in touch with him.

And so these articles are great. They're brilliant, but they couldn't possibly cover everything. They are quite long, but, you know, this has opened a new can of worms. Now, the article I wrote less than 48 hours ago, that's the result. I mean, I should have got onto it sooner, but it's a result of waiting for things for developments.

And I thought, well, just the other day, I thought, I better finish this. I better get something in the public domain because there's going to be follow-ups, I'm sure, by both myself and also The Herald and news.com.au.

You're probably looking at a criminal investigation against the persons in charge of the business undertaking, the directors is a Playground Centre. We're into criminal territory here.

Now what I've done, my approach with this article, I'm sort of trying to stand in Serena's shoes a little bit and I'm looking at what happened from an employment law perspective or let's say from an angle where I'm, you know, I don't have any legal qualifications but I have been blogging for about over five years. So I have a fair bit of experience in assessing what laws are being breached, [whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4318s) they're mostly around employment laws, and I'm going with the constructive dismissal angle. 

So I'm thinking, you know, late November when Sam was just at the end of his tether the best possible outcome at that time would have been for him to just quit his job, come back to New Zealand, go and see his lawyer and raise a personal grievance claim for constructive [dismissal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4348s) And the grounds for constructive dismissal was that he was working excessive hours. He could have been below the Australian minimum wage. In fact, I'm sure he was, possibly below the New Zealand minimum wage as well with all this unpaid overtime.

There were things which I wasn't quite aware of or didn't quite articulate properly at the time, but I did mention the lack of a forklift license, and that's severely negligent.

I think what happened was Playground Centre tried to do things in Australia on a shoestring, and it just doesn't work. They didn't appreciate the cost of doing business in Australia or the setup costs. Obviously, they've spent a lot of money leasing premises for Sam to work in.

You know, they should have spent an extra 5%, 10%, 15 % on making sure that operation was going to run right. And that includes, you know, health and safety, the regulatory obligations, like, you know, if he's going to be driving a forklift, he needs a license. So that's a cost that should have been allowed for.

They put him under incredible stress by mucking him around with his accommodation.

And, you know, just things like that. They just added up and of course we've got this tragic outcome and uh basically all this all the stuff that's uh that they've done or failed to do that could be in breach of various laws in Australia and or New Zealand I mean WorkSafe I I'm sure I hope they get a copy of this edited podcast because they're going to be appalled and I think we are into criminal prosecution territory.

What I don't know is how WorkSafe Victoria are going to be able to collar someone who's based in New Zealand.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4482s)

Well there's an interesting point there because I looked up and playground there's a company called Playgrounds Centre Pty Limited and also the registered in in Australia and for the last month of Sam's life it was that Australian Pty Limited that was paying him so I'm pretty sure that brings him fully under Australian regulations

And I [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4512s) noticed that in the a few months after Sam passed they were it looks like they were trying to close down those corporations they're deregistered for GST which I imagine is you know maybe hoping that they can get those closed down before any legal action takes place so sure I would assume from that that they are they come fully under Australian law at least in respect [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4542s) the last month that Sam was there?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4545s)

Yeah.

Well, regardless of the company structure, Simon Filleul and Dennis Filleul are persons in charge of a business undertaking. In the end, they're responsible for having sent Sam to Australia to do work for them, and they mess it up. And we're probably into criminal negligence territory. They're on the hook.

And they're on the hook of WorkSafe New Zealand to investigate.

WorkSafe New Zealand recently prosecuted two brothers who ran a company called Amex in Nelson. What happened was there was a young man who was in the hull of a boat using brake fluid and he was overcome by fumes. He was unconscious for a while, was pulled out of the boat and he suffered a permanent brain injury. Now what had happened the week before was that someone else was doing the same thing, but had the presence of mind to get out of the boat and filed a report. That report was not submitted to WorkSafe, it was covered up. So sure, the incident resulted in the brain injury.

That did result in a fine, quite a huge fine. But the fact of the previous incident was covered up and it was covered up.

It didn't end up in the district court. So the brothers were jailed for, I think four to eight months for perverting the course of justice.

So WorkSafe prosecutions are rare, but this is a pretty good example. So that's an Amex, the company is called Amex, and I can't remember what they do, but I think they do boat building or maintenance. 

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4673s)

Just very recently we've had the CEO I think of Ports of Auckland held personally responsible that's right yeah.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4682s)

That's right I mentioned that in my blog that was uh yeah yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4685s)

Yeah you know which is which is very unfortunate for that family but absolutely brilliant yeah there should be more of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4696s)

Yeah yeah so just coming back to your point about constructive dismissal what you're saying is that if you were to find yourself so you're working for brethren business and you find yourself in this situation where you're being asked to work ridiculously long hours, where you feel that if you were to speak to a union or if you were to request an improvement in your working conditions you feel that you would be in [trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4726s) with the company, a very good option would be to to leave the job and then uh claim for constructive dismissal on the basis that they've put you in a position that was impossible and in which you couldn't safely carry out the work that they were asking you to do. Is that your your suggestion?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4747s)

That's right So he was put in a position where he had no choice but to quit. And that's the definition. Basically, that's the definition of constructive dismissal.

As Harley said, he would have been better off working at McDonald's. At least he would have been, you know, McDonald's are an asset situation. 

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4771s)

We have screenshots of him looking for jobs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4773s)

And here's that screenshot again of his search history of what he was looking for in jobs.

Serena, I want to go back to what were some of the red flags that you were seeing near the end where he was getting frustrated? I know we have some screenshots I'll put up here and some conversations that you guys have had, but like, can you tell our listeners, those that aren't really seeing the screen here. Can you explain to some of his frustrations and what he was up against, what he was expressing to you prior to him passing away?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4808s)

Yeah, he was getting really frustrated with the lack of help. He had asked to be able to bring on a contract to help with some of the labor, told yes, but nothing ever happened. So he continued to do things himself.

You know, he had to cancel events with us because he had to catch up with work in the weekends.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=4834s)

So these are some of the screenshots that we have from conversations with Serena and some other people here that I'm going to read out quickly.

This first one you see, it's going on about him telling Serena about a new job that he's gotten. And in the next 12 months, he's going to be moving to Melbourne. Serena asks him; 

“What's the job?”

 And Sam replies, 

“It'll either be an inventory management role or production management at a new site that Playground Centre is intending to set up there.”

She asks,

“ What suburb is the warehouse at?”

“ No information on that yet. I was just given some insight by my boss about what direction the company is moving and offered me the opportunity to put my hand up for the move when it happens. He talked me through it because I mentioned I was going to leave for another job early next year and they didn't want me to leave…”

And he goes on to say, 

“...and it sounds like once I'm up, I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling between Victoria and Western Australia, visiting sites, installers, and managing clients. It's a big jump from just banging a hammer.”

And then he goes on, 

“They're looking at long-term accommodation and asked me if I had family or friends who could potentially house me in the short term.”

 It's funny that they're giving him this grand big promotion, but yet his pay wage didn't at all reflect what he was about to embark on. Another text says;

“ That sounds like a great idea. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to catch up with everyone proper, but that would be awesome.”

 And another text talking about;

“ We've been doing some killer 12-hour days and we're both pretty over it. Ha ha.”

Another text while he's waiting for his boss. Serena asked him when his boss is expecting to arrive. He says;

“... around now. We've been waiting around for the last hour should be here after a meeting or something.”

And another text here is from Sam and Sam is saying;

“ How's it going? I'm doing an extra day today at work just to keep things afloat on the fabricating side. The last week has been pretty hectic with most of my time taking still setting things up. Got a bank account opened, applied for my TFN and have an appointment next month to sort my license out.”

And this one says;

“ Maybe I skip a visit this weekend. Sunday I need to pick up another workmate from the airport and settle him in. Vague plans for next week instead.”

And the next one says;

“ working until lunch one, trying to meet a tight deadline, free in the late afternoon.”

The next one says;

“ I missed out on that place. I've applied for a couple of places in Altona, as well as a couple existing flats. So here's hoping I need to be out of this place on the 25th. So the date is coming fast.”

And the next one says;

“Oh, and other good news. I've been put on the Australian payroll now and I got my full Australian driver's license too. And it goes on to say it was a lot of hassle putting pressure on upper management but it finally got done.”

And here's some text messages between him and another mate. The person texting him says;

“ Hey mate sorry for letting you guys down.”

 Sam replies;

“ Oh man don't you worry about it one bit we got it handled you take care of yourself stress gotten a bit overboard.” 

And the response was;

“ Yes just the whole craziness of the place knowing you're making overpriced crap no job satisfaction the overcrowded nowhere to put anything problem that's not being addressed in the workload “

And Sam responds;

“Tell me about it man preaching to the choir how many days you [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5034s) off? I ended up going off the rails yesterday myself purely to do with trying to plan around Joe and Gail. Those two are fucking psychos”

 And it goes on to say;

“Oh and honestly you haven't really let anyone down the place is horrendously mismanaged and they're going to keep burning people out if it carries on like this.”

 Another person responds;

“Two weeks and doctor wants me to go to part-time but not doing that yet. The way it's looking so far, instead of wasting their time, I should quit.”

And Sam responds; 

“Coming from my experience asking about part-time, Simon just shuts the [idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5064s) down. It would be a shame to lose you. You're like the most fun. I'm definitely leaving next year anyway regardless of what happens with this job. Pretty over it.

Another person responds;

“Yep I think I tried to do the 100 out of 100 thing and started to care too much. I bet little Nigel's being having a field day spreading the shit.”

And Sam goes on to reply;

“ Nah, he's been a good boy today. He's got myself, Mark, Shannon and Michael helping him out today. No smack talk to me anyway.

 Another person responds, 

“Oh shit, poor Shannon. He's already got way too much work on his plate. 

Sam responds, 

“Him and I had a little bitch out about that come meeting yesterday. How they were saying, Oh, all thanks to Shannon. Shannon is amazing. We would never have done it without Shannon. Yeah, all he could think of was all the backstabbing emails he'd be getting about them. Honestly, after yesterday, I believe Gill in particular, is fucking insidious. I could not work under her permanently. I'd probably end up smacking someone out.”

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5121s)

He was just exhausted. Anytime he came to see us, he was absolutely exhausted. And he, you know, he'd talk us through everything that was going on. And, you know, we'd give him the advice. And it's just like he just felt I guess a bit hopeless like where the all the advice we're telling him is this stuff is the stuff we're going through right talk to a union and talk to OH\&A … talk to somebody that's but there just was nobody [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5151s) him to talk to apart from us and uh you know he was just exhausted from the work from looking for a place to live which is so so hard.

You know I'm from a double income family, we live in an affluent suburb. Before we bought here we couldn't find a rental. There are no rentals here.

We had to buy an apartment that we didn't want to live in to be able to move to the area that we live in to [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5181s) the house that we actually want to live in you know that's how little property is available in Melbourne. And that's with, you know,

10 years plus of Australian employer, you know, pay slips, contracts, all the rest of it for both me and my partner, you know, clean credits, everything. And we couldn't get in, you know, what chance did he have? 

Having just arrived in the country, no, no Australian documentation at all, no Australian contract, no Australian pay slips, no no time to actually go to a house [inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5222s) which is you can't apply for a house here unless you physically go to the inspection, it's part of the process.

 So yeah he had no chance there was no way he was going to be living in his own place the best he could hope for is maybe going into a like a serviced apartment or something but that needed to be a work you know that's a work thing so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5247s)

Yeah and as we go on in this absolutely horrific ordeal so this led up to he was feeling sick, he was feeling down and feeling sick and he needed some time off. Can you walk us through what happened when he was asking for some time off?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5268s)

Well I think that was actually a conversation that Dad had with Shannon, so he'd be better to talk about that.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5275s)

Well, I had the conversation with Sam, you know, it was just a regular, how's things going?

### [**Raewyn  Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5282s)

We did a lot of video calls, video checks with Sam.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5286s)

Yeah, and, you know, he said to me, to us, that he wasn't feeling well, he was tired, had, he wanted some time, take some time off.

But then he had rung Shannon.

And Shannon had said, like it says in the in the scripts that he could have the day off, but there was work to be done first, which involved a delivery, I think,in the morning of that day he wanted off, now again a delivery to us is like you know half an hour there and back uh in Melbourne that could be the whole morning if not longer. We don't know he didn't mention yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5339s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5340s)

Didn't say where it was too and in a you know in a city of five million yeah it's it's that's highway traffic that's you know stress and concern getting to just getting there.

### [**Raewyn Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5355s)

The last time we spoke to Sam was again a video chat, it was a Sunday ,was it an afternoon, Sunday afternoon he was working yeah because he said he just had to go and drop something off or go and pick something up , he looked absolutely exhausted.

And I'm not sure if it's that chat or the one day or so beforehand we said to Sam you don't have to stay there you can come home and then we can sort things out from there and you know you can just find another job and everything else and he just reply;

But [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5396s) don't want to fail.

And that was the bones of Sam he just yeah he didn't want to let anybody down he wanted to prove he could do it all even with no backing and no support.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5411s)

His personal motivation was that he wanted it to work.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5415s)

I think he had his independence back I think after being so entwined with his ex-partner and whatever he just wanted to get out there and do his life on his own terms and he also knew he could come and work for me in my business and come and stay with my family but you know it was it's not even an option to him he you know he's a grown man to do his thing.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5439s)

Yeah and as I say regardless of the hurdles he wanted it to work he was perhaps looking at the long game that the harder he worked now the better the result would be later on.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5457s)

Because he wanted a family he wanted to pick a fence he wanted everything and he knew he had to work hard to get there so yeah he didn't want to sidestep something he thought if he worked through and gave everything then it would all work out and he would get to where he needed to be but…

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5474s)

I mean really he had no comparison there was he had nothing to compare to the difficulties he was having he really didn't know if that was the normal way to be treated.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5491s)

Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5493s)

Yeah yeah yeah we did tell him that it was going to be hard because he was in a new country in a new organization you know there was going to be all sorts of wonderful things.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5507s)

They found that exciting yeah that was**,** yeah that's what he wanted to make work.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5512s)

Do you feel that they supported him that the way he should have been supported in order to be successful at what he was doing there?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5520s)

No no not at all there was no support there so yeah there wasn't even an inkling of support yeah he constantly told us about as we've said about unanswered messages unanswered emails and unanswered phone calls.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5534s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5535s)

He was expected to do everything like I said before from all the labor work through to the office work to invoicing purchase orders they didn't even give him a Bunnings card to go and buy tools.

For my own personal details to use to fly for a train to buy the company tools that he needed to do the job.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5560s)

Did they supply like gas for him? Like did they supply the basics for him or did he have to pay for that all up front first?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5568s)

He paid for it up front first so they got him a ute. He was promised a Ford Ranger this is one of the reasons he wanted to come over a Ford Ranger to drive around and whatever got to the airport ended up in this single cab, just plain tray at the back.

They needed a personal credit card to put down because the company didn't put one down so then Sam had to obviously put his credit card down for [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5598s) you know that and and this kid he didn't have he didn't have credit cards and things like you know he didn't he didn't hadn't done that part of life yet so it was a mess to begin with he never had a yeah no no work credit card to buy you know all of the the screws and odd ends and paints and glues and whatever that he needed to buy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5622s)

Do you think that they abused his inexperienced capabilities in a new work job? [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5633s)

Oh definitely it's in the email that says that Sam's good for the job because he knows the way we do things and you know that's he's got an attitude.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5622s) 

Yeah I think it's really important that we actually read out this letter that you're referring to Serena so it's a letter from Simon to Glenn who also obviously works at the Playground Centre and he says:

“Hello Glenn, I have drafted up a starter plan for progressing into Australia this year. Keen for you to have a look and comment etc. In my mind I'm thinking that Shannon would be our Australian Ops Manager. This should take some of the load off you moving forward and potentially Sam for the other role. He would [need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5672s) training so I also suggested a timeline below. A big reason why I think Sam could be good is that he knows our culture, our products and team and has a good attitude. 

These things are the hardest part to train on a remote person. We can train him to be a PM. I understand he is also keen for a career. Obviously this is subject to discussing with all involved but I did tell Shannon I would draft something up for him to look at. You're welcome to show him.” 

He goes on to provide an outline of what he wants to do [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5702s) at the end he says;

“Can we have a time frame for JR to take over all MRP and purchasing to free Shannon up. Wayne and Shannon to do high level only and he ends it with \-  Keen for your thoughts.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5715s)

It looks to me like he was very enthusiastic, he really bought into the idea and they just completely took advantage of that to screw as much work out of him as they could for as little money as they could get away from paying him. Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5732s)

And this is someone who never had real mental health issues, there was never any inkling. Well we were just very very proud of Sam and way he did support his ex-wife and and just he was there all the time for her and all of the attempts she made he it devastated him but he stood by her side and looked after her and brought her through it all and carried her through it and it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5762s) just a good kind caring guy.

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

I saw even in the police statements even I think even Simon had, there was a few in the police statements where people had said, that that wasn't his way like to take his own life, wasn't his way of dealing with things. So this it just for me reading through all the police statements reading through everything that you guys had sent me, it was a hard pill to swallow that somebody of this caliber would approach life that way at the very end, so [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5794s) had to have been so exhausted that the mental capacity of processing what was happening wasn't there and again that is an accountability that lays on Simon and their company.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5809s)

Yeah so again I I'm not sure if it's mentioned anywhere when he or when they separated he realized that he needed help himself.

He went to his GP and was offered medication and he refused those and he said, no, I'd rather do counselling and he joined a gym. 

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5843s)

And he'd ring us and talk to us. We knew that if things were bothering him or yeah you know he didn't hide how he really felt.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5622s)

Yeah so in your words and in your experiences with all of you he was somebody who was able to to address a situation, see the issue in it and be able to adjust that and through counseling  be able to amend that situation within himself so that his mental health was back up on par again.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5892s)

Yeah oh and that's it oh and it's clear that this situation was just beyond, overwhelming his ability.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5905s)

Sleep deprivation is certainly damaging to mental health. 

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5911s)

And the stress we could see all over his face of not being able to find somewhere to live, that was, yeah, that was hard to see. But we checked in with him and we believed he was all right because he would tell us in the past if he wasn't okay. He wasn't trying to voice that. You didn't see it as a weakness to say I'm having a bad day or whatever. And I think just everything piled up and then possibly the last thing was feeling sick.

Worked your ass off to get to where you are and do everything and give up basically your whole life to get it up and running and then get told, oh, you can have a day off, but first you need to go and do this delivery then you can have a day off that that would annoy me that would really it would hurt because you're like well that's obviously what they think of me so

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5968s) 

Yeah when you read through his employer contract the employer definitely didn't hold up their end of what they set out in that contract and there was a Google search that he did right before he passed away. Can you guys, I'm going to put a picture of it up here on screen but can you guys explain what his last search was?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=5987s)

His last search on Google during a phone call to somebody in the company um which lasted 47 minutes

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6008s)

Very unusual.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6009s)

He Googled on his personal phone off to the side.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6015s)

“Work negligence”

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6016s)

What ties the two together, we don't know, because the woman that he was talking to has basically refused to give a statement.

We're hoping at some point that she will be forced to.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6037s)

Legally required to.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6039s)

Yeah yeah at some point she must be legally required to yeah to say what was…

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6047s)

The WorkSafe inquiry uh the investigator has no pull at all in New Zealand and this woman is in New Zealand and the crisis manager that the company hired has told all of the staff “No talking to anybody ever.”

Yeah so within 24 hours 48 hours 24- 48 hours of us being informed that Sam had passed we were then informed by Simon, Okay don't contact us any longer this is the name of this is contact this guy Martin whatever and he's our risk management company.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6091s)

You find out that Sam has passed away and instead of the company supporting you through this, they tell you that  they can't talk to you yeah.

### [**Raewyn  Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6102s)

Yeah that is in, no more emails, no more. Phone calls to go through Martin. They did send Harley a text at some stage to say, it was a little while afterwards it wasn't straight away, that they'd like to financially contribute costs. So we had our lawyer reply and we'd to say that would you know that's nice. What sort of area, range, we put it [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6133s) on them to come up with a figure and that was over a year ago we still haven't heard anything back, so they didn't even respond to that they say.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6144s)

I can put a screenshot of that text in a blog, I can do that for a follow-up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6153s)

Yeah the case on to a risk management company uh and I've looked up the company and it's run by a guy called Martin Wouters and their kind of slogan about their company it says they are “Holding WorkSafe to account”.

So their whole business is not holding, you know it's not their business is not helping employees, their business is not holding corrupt business owners [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6183s) account, their business is holding WorkSafe to account \-  in other words if you're a business owner if you've screwed up in health and safety and someone's got hurt this company will work to try and get you off the hook and reduce your abilities.

And so we can see on the coronial brief, the report for the coroner, that all the company representatives and Playground limited either say nothing at all or they just give absolutely minimal one-line answers to the questions. They've all been shut down.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6219s)

Yes. Yeah. Completely. And that's what we were told straight away. Yeah. That don't even don't don't contact us only through this risk management group and we had to

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6233s)

Yeah I contacted Martin Wouters on October the 16th. First of all, I called, I tried Simon Filleul’s number. He didn't answer. I didn't leave a message then I tried Martin Wouters he did answer I introduced myself, told him what we did. I don't like putting people on the spot.

So I said, look, I've got some serious allegations regarding the [passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6263s) of one of Playground Centre's employees. And he said, yeah, what about him? And I said, OK, I'll just send my questions by email. That will be in a few hours. So I did. That's about just over one page. And I got the same response as Ben Plummer of the Herald got. And the response was, now I will send my questions later, but the response was;

 “Hi Tristan, the Playground Centre [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6293s) committed to supporting the health, wellbeing and the safety of communities through our recreational solutions. This commitment extends to our team members. We are saddened by Sam's passing and have offered our sincere condolences to his family. We have provided our full cooperation to the Victorian Police and WorkSafe Victoria since this incident late last year and continue to support any ongoing inquiries. We understand that the Coronial and WorkSafe Victoria investigations are ongoing and therefore no further comments will be provided.”

That was, I think, the following day. His response was quick but it was very perfunctory and it was basically what was provided to the Herald..

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6343s)

Yeah it's I've actually been in contact with him last week right just just to poke the bear.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6354s)

Remind them we're not going anywhere.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6356s)

Yeah, I said, basically, that we haven't received Sam's personal tools from, from the workshop. We haven't got them. Where are they? And we want them. And initially, I got a, “We're all on holiday till the 13th.”

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6380s)

Then the next day I got an actual email from him. Just acknowledging that he had received my email and that he would be discussing it with Playground Centre next week, being the 13th. So yeah, what made him get out to answer that email, I don't know, when another one had already been sent.

### [**Raewyn Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6407s)

Like I was saying with Sam's positions that were sent over in a container they said they “graciously let Sam have room in the container” just when when equipment was shipped over they didn't need to but they let him have the room so we asked for those possessions back.

Originally, they wanted us to collect his possessions from the workshop in Melbourne. And we were like, that's not going to work. And they wanted Serena to go and collect them. And we said, No, you return it all to our address here in New Zealand.

They took a bit of fighting to get done and then they a little package or pallet turned up one afternoon with Sam's belongings in there

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6462s)

Essentially a suitcase

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6464s)

And his work tools weren't in there and that's what we're asking for we want all his work tools back that were seen and acknowledged by the guy who found Sam he said he walked in there was a forklift and then a bag of tools and that bag of tools is what we are trying now to get back.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6485s)

Given that that was a tradesman, his tools are an extension of him.

For us to get a copy of Sam's contract and payslips, we were ignored and then Harley luckily had gone through and got a High Court letter of administration granting him the authority to be able to ask for that information which Martin told us originally we're not doing anything to get that letter or prove it. 

So we did that and then Harley asked for the contract and everything and then we were ignored for a week wasn't it yeah, and so Harley then sent another email and said as letter of administration of Sam's estate given by the High [Court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6535s) you need to provide this information.

 I don't know if it was the same day or the following week we finally he finally sent the copy of the payslips and contract that we've all got through but it wasn't given to us ,we had to  get legal backing before he would even release all that sort of information so it's just a whole load of the legal costs.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6564s)

How much did that cost you in legal fees to get all that.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6566s)

It came out of Sam's estate, it was around seven**,** seven eight thousand and it came off Sam's estate. 

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6576s)

You had to spend seven to eight thousand dollars for uh in legal fees to get things like pay slips and the employment agreements that you would have been entitled to anyway under the Privacy Act?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6592s)

This is unbelievable you know.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6596s)

That's the whole administration of the estate.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6600s)

It's to fight yeah to get everything and to tidy things up and the usual state side of it what it costs to get extra to get that information we don't know because it was all put into one bill and yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6616s) 

So going through something like this under the guise of a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church company right, what are your guys's takeaways of a group like this? And you can be as blunt as you want.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6632s)

So what would you say to someone who was wondering whether to take a job with a …

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6639s)

Don't yeah not worth it no matter what you get paid it's not worth selling your soul for it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6644s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6644s)

And destroyed for and just being treated like you're nothing and you don't mean anything and you're worthless, just just run, run away don't go near them.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6657s)

Quite clearly there is them and the worldly and the worldly are of no consequence.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheime**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6663s)**r**

And the worldly people are there for their beck and call, they you know what I mean like yeah you can guarantee that other people yeah you think of other people would have been paid more than 28 an hour from what Sam was doing. So if you were a community member, I guarantee you weren't making just $28 an hour for doing what Sam was doing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6685s)

Okay, yeah. And this is a huge issue because in all the brethren-owned companies, the brethren members are paid multiples of what the non-brethren members are paid, even though none of the brethren members have like university qualifications. So they'll be having people with PhDs who have paid half what their brethren equivalents are and of course it's hugely illegal because it's religious discrimination it's paying someone a different account just based [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6716s) what their religious belief is so it's all very carefully covered up.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6720s)

Because at the risk of going off on a rant I've seen we have a number of groups here in New Zealand Cheryl, we have the Destiny Church who are only yeah they're a cult they're only too happy to take tithing from everybody yeah for nothing in return yeah and I mean yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6747s)

You don't have to look far into the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church to see how much money, I mean they've got 1.2 billion in Australian dollars just swilling around inside their various charities doing nothing so the the reason that Sam was paid such a shockingly low rate has nothing to do with the amount of money that was available.

We're going to put up pictures of Simon Filleul's house and so I [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6777s) it's a five bedroom five bathroom I think it's valued at about 1.75 million and that by brethren standards is relatively modest but there's you know there's the church of money, it's the church of greed and all they really care about at the end of the day is the is the bank balance and equally that's their valuation of people.

I mean what is a person worth in their eyes the value of a person and it's their net worth. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6808s) don't have any integral worth. It's just the richer you are, the better you are.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6814s)

My wife recently started a new job in the city. She works with social enterprises.

She was sort of only a week into work before we headed off to a family holiday. We were in Fiji for a week, which was amazing. But when we got back, she got news that a colleague of hers had taken his own life while we were away. So the employer, you know, got everyone in the same room and offered all of these support. You know, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6853s) first thing they said is, if you don't feel like you can work today, that's okay, just go home. 

You know, we all know that everyone has their own things going on and it's a horrible time of the year and if there's anything that we can do to help support you guys you know let us know here are all the help lines that the Australian government has uh and then they individually checked in on every team member you know and that felt although it was an awful [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6883s) for Valina, at least she felt like the employers gave a shit about everybody that was there and they were respectful about the situation and the way that work was conducted over the next sort of month or so uh you know miles away from I what I imagine happened at Playground Centre for you know the young guys that work there which is horrendous. I had many of [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6913s) young workers check me out on my LinkedIn profile and I just sort of think oh you know they're just trying to figure out what's going on because they've probably been given whatever narrative yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6929s)

There's there's an article here that hypocrisy is just yeah absolutely insane so we're gonna, I mean Simon you know I know you're gonna watch this podcast and I think the biggest thing that you're lacking in this whole ordeal is compassion and because RRT your guys's charity arm of the whole cult is about compassion and helping others I really hope that you can sit down and watch this not once not twice but three times to get it through your brain to understand how you can put out an article like this and then turn [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=6972s) and treat the Keast family the way you've treated them.

 Sorry, I'm getting a little riled up here right now because this is just my biggest issue with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. The Plymouth Brethren cult, I should call it, is that they have no idea how to take accountability when it comes to emotional health and mental health. And that's not even putting in the spiritual and physical abuse that you guys put on all of your followers, if you want to call them that. So this is an [article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7002s) about their chatterbox seats. Yeah, Richard, take it away.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7006s)

Yeah, so Simon Filleul has, well, he's got three businesses, the reasons we'll explain later, but as well as Playground Centre, he's also got Urban Effects, which does like street furniture, which is kind of closely related business. And this is, he's been interviewed for or by a news organisation.

And the article's titled;

“Take a Seat, Wanganui, Let's Chat About Big Things”

And this was published in 19th of September 2023\.

So it says;

“The creators of the chatterbox seat Emily Turnbull and Wanganui-based company Urban Effects, (that's Simon's company) are on a mission to get people talking about the big things this Mental Health Awareness Week That's 18th to 24th September 2023\.

Designed to build awareness and help remove the stigma around mental health, the first Chatterbox seat was installed at Point Chevalier Beach in Auckland in time for last year's Mental Health Awareness Week with the support of the Auckland Council and the Albert Eden Board.

 For this year's Mental Health Awareness Week, Emily and Urban Effects are calling on other local communities to follow Auckland Council's lead and take the simple, easy step of installing their own New Zealand[\-made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7093s) chatterbox seats to foster healthier and more connected communities. For every chatterbox seat installed, Urban Effects will donate one “I Am Hope” youth counselling session, Mike King's mental health charity that provides counselling and mental health education for young people nationwide. 

When Emily's husband, Daryl Payton, died by suicide in 2019, there were only a handful of people who knew he had bipolar. [Darrell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7123s) felt deep self-stigma believing that he would be treated differently or judged if people knew of his diagnosis so he kept it a secret from his friends and family. Emily is now on a mission to get Aotearoa more comfortable chatting about the big things. As a community we must get more comfy having chatter that matters, Ms Turnbull said. We need to make sure it feels as normal to chat about the big things as it does to sit down on a bench in a park. Every chat is an opportunity to make a [positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7153s) difference in someone's life, she said.

Urban Effects CEO Simon Filleul said the chatterbox seat is not just any ordinary everyday piece of street furniture, it's a symbol of a community's support of well-being and mental health. The chatterbox seat provides an open invitation to pause, sit down and truly connect with others. Whether these people are friends, family or strangers passing by, sitting here, it means you're keen to chat, Mr. Filleul said. In a [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7187s) where it's often difficult to talk about how we're feeling, the chatterbox seat reminds us that it's perfectly okay not to be okay and chatting about it really helps, Mr. Filleul said.

The ministry of health survey revealed that in 2021-22 the number of young people 15 to 24 years experiencing high or very high psychological distress had doubled in little more than a year as had the number who had attempted suicide”

… and so on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

Here's what I propose. I propose that you guys find one of these chatterbox seats I think that you should send Simon an email let him know the date the time that you're going to be sitting on one of these seats and ask him to join you ,and I would take a picture, as many pictures as you can of Sam set them all up and around and for every freaking email and phone call that was not answered to Sam that he can sit down and have a conversation with your entire [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7250s) on one of these seats that he he put.

The hypocrisy of the brethren is they're all about talk they're all about show and this what goes on behind the doors is the complete and utter opposite, and I think I've just come to my end of my rope with the hypocrisy when it comes to mental health. 

So when I saw this post Serena that you had put up it broke my heart. I was like literally it was the last straw for me of like, this is ridiculous, this is absolutely [ridiculous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7280s) that Sam suffered the way that he suffered and he wasn't even born into this cult.

We have podcast number six with uh Christine who did a podcast with us and podcast number 56 with Floss and they both gave an account of their time and both of them ended up an extreme mental health, extreme mental health situation where both of them were on the same bridge that Sam was standing on, and this isn't [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7310s) a one-time thing that is happening that we're hearing about it.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7313s)

That article I believe came out only weeks after Sam's death.If not days, absolutely disgusting.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7323s)

Nothing was either on social media that anything could happen.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7327s)

They've never publicly acknowledged.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7330s)

They said merry christmas thanks for a great year to customers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7335s)

Simon you need to, actually you guys shouldn't even be reaching out to Simon, Simon should be reaching out to you. He'll watch his podcast. I guarantee you he'll watch his podcast. So Simon, you've heard it all. You've heard their story. It's up to you to reach out to them and make a date on a chatterbox seat. It's exactly what you created them for.

We'll be there. Yeah. The thing is, is that the people that work for them, that aren't a part of the community, aren't immune to this brainwashing. They're not immune to the effects of how this cult works, right? And you can see this in Sam's case, right? He was too scared to ask for what he needed. He was, there was always this fear-based, you get, and Christine on podcast number six, Floss said the same thing on podcast number 56, that it was no different.

They went through the same [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7384s) of brainwashing and the after effects of leaving their business as someone like us who left the church went through, so Sam wouldn't have went through, like he wasn't immune to the indoctrination effects of that cult and as much as anybody wants to stand here and take like a neutral position there isn't a neutral position in this right?

There's not a neutral position, it doesn't exist [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7414s) the cult is so they have such power and control over how they maneuver people they're so…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7423s)

Manipulative.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7425s)

They're so manipulative and they're so, there's such professionals at it, right? There's such professionals at it that I think this is why I wanted to pick up this podcast. It's because my heart broke for the last time over a non-community member having to go through what we all went through. But we were born into it, he wasn't born into it, right? From everything that I read that you guys sent me, Sam did not have the personality of someone who would have taken his life. He didn't have that.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7455s) how then does somebody who's working for our cult business end up in the predicament that he's in if he wasn't under the same influence of those that were already inside this cult? That's where I draw the line every single time. Someone comments on TikTok, someone comments, someone emails us, someone, I mean, there is a ton of comments that I'm going to put in here of people who have worked for them. I'm just going to read out a few of these that we found through social media and messages that were also sent to us. The rest of them will be in a folder [below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7486s) that you guys can sift through.

So this first one says, 

"What's the deal with the PBCC business working hours being such a long day? Has this always been a thing?"

 And the next one says, 

"Further to the post about working for a Brethren company as a worldly, I was with them for about seven years and when it suited them, I was let go with very little warning. Most of the wives were very lovely, at least to my face, but the men are a whole different story. To be fair, there were some who could be decent, but the majority are unbelievable, arrogant, and ignorant, [openly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7516s) racist. The younger ones are the worst. They are totally unqualified to run the business as they do. The never-ending money-go-round is unbelievable, but from what I can see, what Bruce Hales says, Bruce Hales gets."

And the next one says, 

"I work for a Brethren-owned business and not of the same faith. Since the raid, I'm more aware of the mindset of this community. I now have doubts of working for the company." Another one said, "Weird things about working for a PBCC-owned company, volume one: keeping a spreadsheet of PBCC versus non-PBCC employees so I knew, number one, who I could and could not sit down with in the lunchroom. Two, who I could and could not invite to our work events. Number three, who could travel and stay in a hotel unsupervised and who had to have a chaperone. Number four, who could and could not wear jeans on casual Fridays."

"Sadly, everyone around me called this out as a cult from day one, but I remained in denial for almost two years while in leadership there."

"They can also make one of their distant cousins the head of a department and promote as they wish. Totally biased and only care for their own. I don't know why they are not in trouble for being discriminatory. I have thought about filing a report many times, but then I hold myself back because I don't have any evidence now. And I also think some who are non-community in this organization pretend to match up to their standards to butter them up and keep their jobs."

And the next one says,

 "Yep, I know it's owned by a group of brothers. Honestly, they creeped me out during my time there. They kept on inventing, changing their own roles and titles whenever they wanted."

"Treated some non-community members in a very unfair way, including me. Some non-community members in managerial positions also tried playing their game but couldn't do it after a while. A lot of staff leaving lately."

And this was a comment on one of Ben Woodbury's that he did. It says,

 "I used to work for a cult person. They didn't pay me right and Bruce Hales paid my lawyer to drop the case."

And another one said,

 "I worked for Brethren for a while. I quit after they told me I needed to put my work before my family." And the comments underneath say, "I lasted four months working for those weird-ass misogynists. I'm not shocked or surprised they're involved in money laundering."

"I think we need to change the rules around churches and their charitable statuses. It shouldn't be de facto."

And the last one I'm going to read out says,

 "Their work environments are so toxic. Hubby is a supervisor for them, and they constantly have their foot on his throat. Such dictators."

And I think it's super important that we read out this email, Harley, that you sent to your lawyer regarding something that Simon had done behind you guys's back. And so I'm just going to read the highlighted part here and it says, 

"In the same conversation, we found out that on the same day, December 21st, after being told that all correspondence is to go through you guys, Simon contacted this person's parents trying to discuss Sam's service and personal effects. We are not happy about this at all. From what they said, Simon was trying to play [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7695s) off against us." 

And it goes on to say, 

"We told this person's parents not to discuss anything with Playground Centre management. We advise them to direct the company to you only."

It's absolutely, it's so disheartening that a church that calls them a place of compassion, a place of care and respect and everything that they say they stand for, there's nothing in behind those doors that represents that. And we hear it over and over and over. And now I'm not saying that there are some simple grassroots [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7726s) in there that are good people that treat their workers good. They do exist in there. But for the majority that have cut that, of what we see come forward to us in Sam's situation, that's what broke my heart. It's because here is someone who wasn't even born into this cult but then ended up in the same mental and emotional disparity that we can actually, I mean, we can only assume that, right? That he didn't think of a way out. He didn't see a [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7756s) out of someone who would have never done that.

That's the point that I want to make in this podcast, is that just because you weren't born into it, you are not immune to the effects of this cult indoctrination. My suggestion is don't work for a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church business. Just don't work for them.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7774s)

Toxic, toxic is the word, isn't it? It's poisonous. You can't, if you go into there, you're going to be affected by it. I mean, that's what a toxin is.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7782s)

Over time, Sam had mentioned that they, you know, they go and eat separately and they do this separately and, yeah, at the time it just seemed very at best, odd. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's just, you know, whatever, you go and do what you do, that's fine. It's, yeah, for it to come to this, it's just unbelievable, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

Yeah, my heart breaks for you guys and what you're going through. Like, it's, we don't wish this on anyone and I'm so sorry that Sam ended up working for someone part of the cult that had that mentality imposed on him and that he didn't find, he didn't think of a way out. That, you know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's sad that his brain got so involved with them from somebody who was so bright and so smart that even their [effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7847s) affected him.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7847s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As we said, it wasn't an option. It was never an option when he was having, or when Annie was having issues. Yeah. When things started getting difficult for him in Melbourne.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7869s)

He wouldn't walk away.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7870s)

He, at one point, he said, yeah, or was it in Melbourne where he said, "You know, do you feel, are you feeling suicidal?" And he said, "No, absolutely not. It's not an option." And then, yeah, here we are. This is just sort of striking.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7890s)

He was so loyal to them, but they had absolutely no loyalty to him at all. Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7896s)

I think that's it. And then he, on that phone call, he realized, "No, you know, on that, I don't give a..." I mean, yeah, that people didn't realize that I am nothing to them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7905s)

And I think that that phone call, his last phone call he had, that is pivotal. I think that's absolutely, it's so torturous on your guys's end to not have any contact with that person who had the last conversation with them for 47 minutes.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7924s)

That's a long phone call for anybody.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7928s)

Her name's Chrissy, didn't even have the decency to report the direct time and date in the coroner's report.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7941s)

In the coroner's report, she said it was Wednesday morning. Officially with phone records, it was Tuesday afternoon. Yeah. Is Chrissy a part of a deceitful or possibly just a mistake?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7953s)

Deceitful, or possibly just a mistake?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7957s)

No, I don't think you can mistake something like that. You took 47 minutes and then you get the day and the time wrong.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7965s)

This was the day, I mean, she must have heard on the day after that he had passed. How could she possibly forget that last phone, yeah, forget the last phone call with someone who's taken their life? I mean, that's not...

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7978s)

They all had documentation of when the phone call happened. They used a turn-on communication system.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7984s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7985s)

I mean, the call is probably recorded. We used to use them for our medical practice all the time.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7991s)

Yeah, there's some cover-up happening there, isn't there?

### [**Raewyn Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7995s)

I agree. We wouldn't have known all of this if we hadn't been able to get hold of Sam's phone. Everything we know, because we've, or Seri more than anyone, has investigated and dug in deep. Nothing we know has come directly from the company, other than that they don't want to talk to us. So we've only known that it was a 47-minute call, his last call, and who by his phone records.

So we have reached out to them in the sort of first steps of the mediation process in New Zealand employment law, yet to hear back, of course, because of the [severity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8040s) of the situation. They have tried to bring it closer, but they can choose to not attend. What happens after that? I'm not too sure. Tristan, you might be more over what happens in that kind of situation?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8057s)

Sure. Well, the idea of a mediation is that it should result in a confidential settlement, so the public is not going to know what was achieved in that mediation. So the story just, you know, there is no story. I can't report on it because it's confidential. If mediation fails, you can normally, if it's an employment relationship problem, you can go back to the Employment Relations [Authority](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8087s) and say, "Look, we failed to resolve our differences in mediation, so we need to litigate."

And there'll be an investigation meeting, usually. Sometimes it's done in person or on the papers through submissions, and then there'll be a determination months later which sets out the facts and the law and the result, who needs to pay what. And then there'll be a costs determination after [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8117s) if the parties can't agree on costs.

So this is one of those unusual situations where if it went to the Employment Relations Authority, the ERA may say, "Well, we don't have jurisdiction to deal with it because..." Or actually, I've had a look for precedents of the estate of a person suing an employer, and the only situation where that's happened is where a living person has brought a grievance but then passed away, say, months later before the, let's say after the investigation meeting or after submissions have been made, but before the determination has been reached. The intervening period might be a few months. And that's happened, I think I sent Serena a few examples of that a couple of months ago. And there's nothing remarkable about that.

But then the situation, Sam passed over a year ago. So can an estate sue? I don't know. There is no precedent that I could find on the Employment Relations Authority database. So if Serena was brought an action, I think part of the basis of that was that, just to write down a note this morning. So knowing that Sam was broke, forcing him into, you know, revoking his accommodation, that was extremely reckless. And I would say recklessly indifferent to his financial situation. Working, you know, every hour that God sends for peanuts in the midst of a housing crisis in Melbourne.

And what they've done is they forced him to borrow, Serena, what was it, $1,500 to $2,000 Australian dollars. So what's the process for getting that money back? I mean, Sam would never have been in a position to pay that back if he had lived. So basically, you've been tapped by Playground Centre, by this company, you know, Brethren-owned or not, for money to support what should be Playground Centre's operating expenses. And that's wrong.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8284s)

Yeah.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8288s)

End game, my big target once the big WorkSafe investigation has been done is going after a charge of industrial manslaughter. Is everyone aware of what that entails here in Australia? Can you explain it just for our viewers? I think it's really good that you go through that.

**Tristam Price**

Yeah. Okay. So negligent conduct, so they explain it as this. For the purposes of workplace manslaughter, conduct will be considered negligent if it involves a great falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would have taken in the circumstances and a high risk of death, serious injury, or serious illness. Negligent conduct also [includes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8341s) a failure to act or an omission, for example. It may include when a person does not adequately manage, control, or supervise its employees or does not take responsible action to fix a dangerous situation where failing to do so causes a high risk of death, serious injury, or serious illness.

The test is based on the existing common law test for criminal negligence in Victoria and is an appropriately high standard considering the significance penalties for the new [offence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8371s). So it's relatively new, but the penalties if convicted of workplace manslaughter, the following penalties apply: a maximum of 25 years imprisonment for individuals and a maximum fine of $16.5 million for body corporates. So it's a huge charge. I believe only three charges have been made in Victoria, so they're successful charges. One included a bullying case where a young woman committed suicide jumping off a building.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8407s)

Was that Brodie's Law?

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8410s)

That's Brodie's Law, yeah. Yeah, explain Brodie's Law to our listeners too. So Brody's Law, Brody was a young woman, I believe she was about 18, working as a barista in a Melbourne cafe. She was entangled in some kind of sexual relationship with some of her co-workers or a co-worker, I don't know. But she was also bullied a lot by these guys that she worked with. She did complain to her supervisors and managers about it, who did nothing about it. At some point, she ended her own life by jumping off a building.

After her investigation, they decided that the bullying was, you know, the company allowing that bullying to happen was workplace negligence and they were fully charged, and so were the guys that did the act itself. Yeah, Brodie's father, Damien Panlock, is a big advocate for Brodie's law. I think the other two cases have involved more just tradies [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8483s) the wrong thing. I think one has been an owner that drove a forklift on an incline and they ended up losing their load and killing someone. And another one was someone fell off the top of a ute trying to secure a load with a sole contractor boss. Yeah, so...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8511s)

Did Simon report this death to WorkSafe?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8518s)

No. And do you think he was under, like, do you think he knew he was supposed to report it to WorkSafe? He knew. I believe that his PR guy told him not to.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8529s)

And we have an email that you got. Martin. Yeah. He's useless.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

I want to share this, just so people understand that it should be reported to WorkSafe when someone passes away at work. So this is an email that you received from WorkSafe, right? That says, 

"Serena, thank you for contacting WorkSafe New Zealand. If the death arises from work, the PCBU (person conducting a business or undertaking) has a duty under section 56 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 to notify [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8567s) regulator. We are unable to find any notification for the death of your late brother under PCBU, Playground Centre Limited. However, you may still reconfirm with the PCBU should they have reported it under a different legal name. Should you wish to notify or raise a concern about the death of your brother, you can do so via the form on the following link and it will be triaged accordingly." 

And that is exactly what you did, right? You submitted a claim.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8594s)

I submitted that, and thank goodness I did because they didn't submit their notification. And it wasn't until, I don't know, six or eight months later when I called WorkSafe to find out what was going on that they told me, "Oh, hold on, no one's reported this. We don't have it on file." And then they very quickly started to move.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8617s)

So they were, it wasn't reported in New Zealand or Australia?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8622s)

No, it wasn't reported in either country. No, neither country, no. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8630s)

As well. Did you, is WorkSafe Victoria now investigating?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8636s)

It's their jurisdiction because the death happened here, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8639s)

Yeah, but that was because you contacted them?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8642s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Had I not contacted them, they would not have investigated.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8645s)

That's amazing. So that's what you meant by “Twisting and weaving on both sides of the ditch” Tristram, that they're trying to weave by using the fact it's two countries, they're trying to dodge it both ways.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8659s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the ditch is the Tasman Sea.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8669s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8671s)

So what I find amazing is, you know, Playground Centre is a business. It doesn't matter if it's Brethren-owned. I mean, I don't really discriminate. I don't discriminate against any religious or racial minority. I mean, some have their quirks. Certainly, there are migrant exploitation cases, and the nationality of those involved could be obvious by the ERA determination. But the [ERA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8701s) doesn't discriminate either. They just look at the facts, who did what and to what extent they did it, including underpayment of wages, that kind of thing.

But what I find really amazing is that, you know, Brethren in general, they're very good at business and Playground Centre is very good at marketing. You look at their Facebook page and it's got some, you know, a lot of feel-good posts and yeah, really good work. Now, unfortunately, they've had a workplace death and they've done everything wrong, you know, everything wrong leading up to that and then everything wrong afterwards.

You'd think they would, having a crisis on their hands, which is including a PR crisis, they should be bending over backwards to make sure that they limit the damage to their companies. And they're not, they're doing everything wrong. They're ducking and weaving. They're making promises and not delivering. They're offering financial assistance and paying jack shit. They're blocking phone numbers. [They're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8776s) ignoring emails and they're doing everything wrong.

And then you've got some, let's say, Ben Plummer popping up and doing an article, you know, being outraged himself on a human level and doing this really great article in early October. Then I saw it and then I was fumbling around for about three months deciding what to write about it because it's, you know, this is, this is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8806s) out of, this is highly unusual in my world. Finally got something down less than 48 hours ago. It's had less than 100 views, I think the last time I looked, which was a couple of hours ago. But that's how I ended up on this podcast.

Yeah, yeah. But I think there's going to be more where that came from. I mean, we're getting into industrial manslaughter. We're getting into serious breaches of health and safety law and employment standards, constructive dismissal, just everything. It's got the lot. And it's appalling. Now, I have to be quite dispassionate about it because I try and report in the same way as mainstream media would. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8859s) I want to avoid the perception of bias. It's not my job to tell my readers what to do, what to think, and what to feel. That's the reader's job.

So I just report the facts, you know, maybe link to multiple documents and perhaps explain their relationship to each other. The reader can make up their own minds and, you know, Playground Centre is a brand, and they are destroying their brand by their inaction and ducking and, you know, just general evasiveness. I don't know why they're doing it. Maybe they're getting poor advice or something, or they just don't handle crises [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8903s). I really don't know what that's about. But anyway, it's probably going to get worse for them before it gets better. That's all I can tell.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8914s)

I agree. I mean, what we've seen in the past with Brethren businesses is when they get in a crisis that's too bad, they will change the name of the business and completely rebrand, and you wouldn't even know it was the same business. And I can see that.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8929s)

Yeah. Yeah, that may well happen, but there's still the two persons in charge of a business undertaking for years who made a series of errors that led to a death and they failed to do anything to that death subsequently.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8955s)

I think my favorite part is them trying to blame everything on Shannon.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8961s)

Yeah. Is he still there? Is he still working for...

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8964s)

I have no idea if he's there, if he's not, if he's okay. Like, we don't know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

And we should, I just want to point out that Shannon is a non-PBCC member as well that works there.

### [**Tristam Price**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=8978s)

Yeah, yeah, poor kid.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

Yeah. So I guess, you know, if there was something that you could say to Playground Centre right now, to Simon personally, what would you say?

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9000s)

What's sort of sitting in the back of my mind at the moment is that they've had so many opportunities to make this better, not go away, but they've had so many opportunities. They, you know, at the very beginning, yeah, I get a phone call from Simon that said, "Oh, by the way, Sam's dead." And that was pretty much the tone. Flowers, and then, "Talk to, don't talk to me anymore, talk to this Martin character." No representative at Sam's service. No follow-ups.

The talking chair seat thing that came out only a few weeks, within a few weeks of Sam dying, they could have dedicated, that was actually in Long Island, they could have dedicated that to Sam.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9070s)

That was a golden opportunity.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9070s)

A golden opportunity to say, "Look at us, we care." And they didn't. Just before Christmas, they completed a big installation here in Taronga. Again, they could have put that, dedicated to Sam. "Local lad, you know, worked for us so much for them." Yeah, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm not sure, but there were representatives from Playground Centre in Taronga for the opening of that. Yeah, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9107s) so much as a phone call, knock on the door, invitation, nothing. Yeah, they just keep digging the hole deeper and deeper.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

It's just courtesy. Like, this is just common courtesy, common compassion that you offer somebody, especially somebody who worked for your business. You know, like these are those everyday personality traits that seem to be missing in the cult, right? Like, it's, we see it, I mean, we're 133 podcasts in and we see it over and over and over and over and over, this lack of compassion. And in this case, this is somebody's [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9146s). This is somebody's life. This is somebody's complete and utter disruption of their own family system has been completely torn to shreds. And they should be there at every beck and call trying to find out a way to, "How can I help you? What can I do to help you?" You know?

Grief is probably one of the hardest things to deal with as a human. And a loss of someone that we love. Like, it's just such a heavy burden to walk through. It's a heavy tunnel to walk through.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9180s)

And so much more when it was avoidable. Yeah.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9185s)

That adds to it. He just wanted to do his very best for his employer and for everybody around him. Yeah, and then they just turned around on him.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9201s)

I think that's why, that's what he realized. He and I had a conversation not long before the Christmas, well, not long before he passed, about you know, him wanting to leave and what should he do, and what is he going to do if things don't get better. And his plan was just carry on until the Christmas and New Year break because that means he'll have, you know, two or three weeks of annual leave where he'll [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9231s) able to just sit down and consider his options. And he was pretty sure that at that point he would be done, he'd leave, and that was it. Unless, unless Playground Centre, you know, came to the party and said, "Wow, Sam, you really are doing an amazing job. Here's your title, here's your contract, here's all of the things that you're actually, you know, entitled to at a minimum according to Victorian law."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9257s)

Did they ever make a new contract for him when he was working in Australia? Like, was a new contract drawn up?

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9263s)

No, not that we've been given. We were given his original contract and nothing mentioned in Australia.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9271s)

When I threatened Martin with the high court document that I had, the letters of administration, that was the contract that he sent me. And he confirmed that that was in place while Sam was in Australia.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9287s)

That will have fallen short of Australian standard for construction awards.

### [**Harley Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9294s)

Kind of falls short here too, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=7220s)

Well, I have to say, we sure appreciate you guys all coming on here and having to relive this nightmare again. I mean, I know it's not an easy feat to raise your voice for your loved ones. It's one of the reasons why we have this platform and continue exposing these horrible experiences. You know, it's just, yeah, we're all here for you and if there's anything that you need, please let us know. Reach out to any of us and we'll do what we can to help you guys get some justice on there. As we [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9332s) to the close of today's episode, we want to just take a moment to honor and remember not just Sam, but all the individuals who have tragically lost their lives as a result of the pressures, isolation, and mistreatment connected to this cult.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9344s)

Their stories are not just statistics. They are lives full of potential, dreams, and loved ones left behind. By sharing Sam's story today, we hope to shed light on the systemic issues that continue to impact so many and encourage meaningful change. Let this memorial serve as a reminder that no one should have to face such struggles alone. Together, we can create awareness, foster support, and push for accountability.

This moment is for Sam and for anyone else whose voice has been silenced far too soon.

Please, if anyone is struggling, there are many who want to help you. Please reach out to the numbers listed below. Thank you so much for you guys joining. I really appreciate it. And to everyone listening, we love you.

### [**Serena Keast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FTvmH9xQ0&t=9394s)

We love you. Don't struggle. Please reach out if you're struggling. Until next time, take care. Bye-bye. Thanks, Cheryl. Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
