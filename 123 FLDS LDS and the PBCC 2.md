## Summary

Welcome back to Part 2, where we continue the eye-opening discussion on high-demand religious groups and their manipulative tactics. In this episode, we delve deeper into the experiences of individuals who have left the FLDS and LDS Church, shedding light on the inner workings and control exerted by charismatic leaders like Warren Jeffs and Bruce Hales. Sam and Melissa from @GrowingUpinPolygamy share their personal journeys, the impact of fear-based teachings, and the struggles of self-discovery outside of these restrictive communities. We explore the suppression of information, manipulation of followers, and the disturbing pattern of setting dates for apocalyptic events such as the rapture. Join us as we uncover the psychological and emotional turmoil experienced by those who have escaped and the hopeful message of finding happiness and fulfillment beyond these harrowing environments.

### [**Get a Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3s)

So suddenly, after he had already admitted that he wasn't a prophet, I think it was his brother specifically convinced him that he was the prophet. Like, hold on, wake up here, you are the prophet, you're just going through a time here.

Then it was not very long, I think a few weeks later, all of a sudden, Warren Jeffs has this big revelation and this big visitation in prison and starts writing these, what he calls revelations, for the people. And they have just gotten worse and crazier and more intense ever since. And now, of course, he claims he is the prophet of God.

But still the people call them. They do say that once you put somebody on a pedestal, it's very hard to get them off.

### [**Sam**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3DEvbRWspwJq0%26t%3D68s)

Ooh, yes. And speaking of the date, so of course, Warren Jeffs specifically, and even before him, Rulon Jeffs, would set these dates that this is when the destructions are going to happen. And then, of course, they didn't happen. And when they didn't happen, guess what? It wasn't their fault. They said I spoke to God, that's what God said. The reason it didn't happen is because the people of this church were not prepared. You are not righteous enough. It is your fault.

[He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=98s) has set a new date now and we have to be ready for this time. He's giving you one last chance. If you blow this one, you'll be destroyed. You'll just be poof, gone. That's word for word.

**Ben Woodbury**

 I was going to say, if you're in the Brethren, listen to this. Have a think. This is the same cookie cutter technique on keeping you doing what you're meant to do. Keeping you in the cult or the church. It's the same cookie cutter technique.

You've [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=128s) told recently, I've heard that now it's probably 2029 plus or minus six months. You've got to understand that every single Brethren that I've spoken to, to the oldest member that's ever left that's still alive, there was this idea of a rapture that was given exact timelines, like within three years. This is nothing new. And even more so, you're hearing it from Sam in a completely [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=158s) country, religion. It's just crazy.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=162s)

Yeah, oh yeah. Well, and it can't happen in 2029 because it's happening in the FLDS in 2027\. So you might need to up your timeline a little bit because Warren Jeffs just came out with the revelation, was it last year?

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=176s)

Well, the brethren have kind of switched from WhatsApp to Signal, so there might be a bit of communication between the Man of God and the Prophet.

**Richard Marsh**

 But the thing that strikes me is the excuse was the same, because it was in the 80s or 90s, it was either James Symington or John Hales. You know, there was lots of noise about the rapture coming and then of course it doesn't happen.

And then either Symington or Hales says, well, the Lord would have come [already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=206s), the world is ripe for judgment, but the saints are not ready for it, which is exactly what you were saying. You know, it' would have already happened, you're holding up because you're not right yet. And so then you're holding up the rapture. But then if you break that down just logically, that means that you're admitting that God doesn't see the future, know what's happening coming. Because if he did, he'd know that the saints wouldn't be ready by that time, therefore change the date to a time when they were right.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=233s)

Yeah, or why God wouldn't just do it anyway. And like there's gonna be a point, yeah, exactly. Like why would the timeline of your readiness, there's always going to be people who aren't ready, right? We've been told that our whole lives. Like there's going to be, that's why you always have to be prepared because it could come at any time. And God's not going to have it planned out perfectly, except for when he gives dates to some groups. But like, no, just the fact that it's supposed to be that way. It's supposed to be this like shock and people aren't ready. And then those are going to be destroyed.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=263s)

Yeah. I'm waiting for the day when a prophet or a leader just actually takes some of the blame for himself and says, "Oh crap. Sorry guys. That was my bad. I wasn't quite ready. I forgot and watched the rated R movie yesterday."

Sorry about that. I'll be ready next time, I promise. Yeah, they're like, yeah, sorry mate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=286s)

Or in the PBCC, it's Bruce Hales being like, you know what, I had way too much Johnny Walker last night and I might have sent us back about a couple years.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=295s)

Woke up too late that morning, sorry guys.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=298s)

Well, just know if you make it through 2025 and it hasn't happened, then we can know that the FLDS is, it 2027? Oh 2027, sorry, 2027\. If you miss out on the...

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=309s)

2027, move over to the Brethren and you can catch the 29\. Exactly, there you go.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=316s)

Well, and what's funny too is like, I'm pretty sure like Joseph Smith, it was supposed to happen in his time, right? Like, you know, there were stuff that he preached about then. So it's been this, I mean, it's just this constant cycle, right? Like it was going to happen. The reason that he brought back the gospel to the earth was because he needed to prepare people to be ready for the second coming. And then when that doesn't happen and that doesn't happen, and then you end up with these splinter groups who are trying to get so specific, they're shooting themselves in the foot. But then you can always just whip it around on the people anyway.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=366s)

It's kind of like 101, right? Like where you've got, it's cookie cutter rules, I think for every cult that you have an offering to escape a massive colossal event. And the only way through that to that, you know, better place is via one person, right? Here's the only one with your dates or the knowledge. One thing I'm really interested to know for both of you, would you, and I guess I'm also Sam because you were saying they're very specific about it, would you then consider your the religious group or the cult a doomsday cult?

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=367s)

Yeah, I would just because it's always on top of the mind. In fact, as a young boy growing up, I lived most of my [childhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=397s) in some type of fear. Yeah, I remember coming home from meetings. I dreaded Sundays because I would go to these meetings and it would be talk after talk after sermon after sermon about the destructions, about the end of times coming. And it was constantly taught just using this fear to keep us in line and keep us doing the right thing. I would go home and just be almost trembling in fear of like, what? Like it was [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=427s) so scary. And as a young boy in a young age, that's very hard to hear. And so that's another reason that I ended up moving out. I'm just sick of living in fear.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=440s)

Yeah. I'd say the mainstream LDS church is the creator of a lot of doomsday cults.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=445s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=446s)

And even you see like the Daybells. I don't know if you've heard of the Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell case in the US. I don't know if you know anything about that, but you know, they were mainstream Mormons who kind of went fundamental, became doomsday preppers. All of a sudden they could tell which spirits had light and darkness in them and they ended up murdering their own kids. You know, like there's a lot of stories of stuff like that where or the LeBaron groups or you know, a lot of times people will say at least within the LDS church you hear that, oh, but look at the fruit of the tree. That's how you know if a tree is good or evil is based on the fruit.

And there's a lot of good that the mainstream LDS church does, right? And that was something I was taught looking is like, okay, but look at the fruit of the FLDS tree. They have Warren Jeffs, they have underage brides. That's how you can know that that's a bad tree. You know, there's bad roots and look at ours. We're doing all these [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=500s) things worldwide and we have all these humanitarian efforts and that's why our tree is good. And just recently I was like, I feel like all these smaller groups are the fruit of the mainstream LDS tree. And we're trying to show the fruit over here of us doing these good things, but all these horrible things that are happening in these smaller groups, they broke off from us too. Like they're just our cousins and they're getting their doctrines from the same place.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=526s)

Right.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=526s)

Are they not just fruit of our tree?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=528s)

And in a very similar way, the Brethren have a very, just with their own group, right? Their own people. So they'll take credibility for a business doing well. They'll be like, yeah, we're part of the Plymouth Brethren or for doing good works, you know, publicly. But as soon as one member, for example, sends an abusive text message to an ex-member, leaves a death threat, for example, or does something like horrific like rape somebody, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=559s) then go, well, that's not us. That's an individual person.

Or like when you've got, they don't vote, right? So you'll have Brethren companies that were orchestrated and grouped together and funded a campaign. But when it was publicized and people come forward and go, well, hang on, this is the Brethren. They're like, hang on, no, that's not us. That's just individual companies. So in a very similar way, they'll take credibility, accountability for the good works, but they will not take credibility or accountability rather for all the bad [works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=589s). And it's really important that you understand that if you're in there listening, you have to take accountability for something you have absolute control over.

There is, the people in there have no autonomy over their own thoughts. They have no autonomy over their life choices. So the group has to take accountability for the actions as a whole and regardless of the individual, right? 

**Sam**

For sure. Yeah. And it's crazy because people on the outside world would look at the FLDS, for example, and I know this because I've heard it from a lot of people [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=619s) on the news that if they just can't find anything good about it, like the FLDS church, which is just this awful cult that these awful leaders are doing all of these awful things and everybody is being abused. It's all just this horrible place.

Let me tell you though, when I was in it, once again, like you have both just mentioned, focusing on the good, if that's all you focus on is the good, I felt like I was in a great work, something that was super [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=650s) and that all these amazing things were happening because God was allowing us to move forward and do his work. So just to point out that even a place like the FLDS Church, where the outside world would look at as this awful place, if you're in it and you're focusing on the good, then it can seem like this wonderful, wonderful life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=669s)

And they really know how to do that, right? Like I, to me, it's like these destructive cults that have these charismatic leaders that have had, in our case, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, he had his dad to watch. Warren Jeffs had his dad to watch, right? By the time that these sons take it over, they've got it. They know what they are doing. They know how to marionette the whole system into really grasping the attention of its followers.

I remember my mom, talking to my mom one time and she's like, oh, Cheryl, it's so changed since Bruce took over. It's so, it's all changed. We have like, we have TVs now, we have laptops, we have this, we have that. We have like, he literally let them go into the candy store, filled it with everything that is controlled by their, their streamline three is what it's called. And they don't realize that they're [locked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=724s) inside this candy store, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=726s)

It's literally like they're allowed to go in the candy store and then they can only buy the zero sugar stuff that tastes foul. Like it's not. Yeah, and that's the thing, I guess, when you're so starved of anything really, like in terms of choice or freedom of existence, like when you're offered one little thing, you just focus on that and you're like, oh my gosh, this is the best thing ever.

And my dad said the same thing to me, Cheryl, actually it reminded me when I first left, I think it was about six months [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=757s) something, I bumped into him and he said, you would love it now. It's all changed. We had a fun day. Like they have these days where they have music days, right? Where they, Brethren bands would come together and play and everyone would enjoy it. And he's like, we've had two of them this year. Dad, I've been to see Adele, Lady Gaga and Coldplay all in one year. I'm like, what do you mean? I'm not going to come back for so little.

It was just, and it made me like, I jest about it, but I look back, I remember thinking about it and thinking, [oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=788s) my God, that's all you lived for for this year. That that made you think that, you know, we're evolving, we've changed. You would love it here. And it's really sad. It's really sad because it sounded so empty and then hollow almost, yeah.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=802s)

I think that's happening a lot in the mainstream LDS church right now. There's a lot more what's looked at as freedoms being given in dress. Yes. I just had my sister. She lives in Northern Utah. And there is in Utah, what's called like, it's basically like church camps at all the universities. And it's called, especially for youth. And you go for a week. I went all four years of high school, loved it, ate it up.

But you go on these college campuses and you stay in dorm rooms. And then you go to all these religion classes, but you get to hang out with boys and you get to go to dances and all this stuff. And she called me and she's like, remember when we had to get shorts that hit all the way to our kneecap, because [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=846s) would get, you know, dress code violated so fast for youth camp and this and this and this role. And she's like, there's girls around here in booty shorts and doing this. And they're not like, they don't have to have the same standards anymore.

And while all of those things I'm grateful for that, they've loosened up. Like it's this weird position where you're like, I'm glad that they're less controlling over what you're allowed to wear, what you're allowed to listen to, telling you those things. Like that's good for the next generation. And yet at the same [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=876s), it's like, okay, did God just take a turn? Like now all of a sudden it doesn't matter. And all of the girls that are my age that had to deal with all of that stuff being told that that was gonna affect our purity and that we were gonna be pornography for boys if our shorts didn't hit our knee. Like all of a sudden all of the stuff that we went through just doesn't matter anymore. Like it was all for naught.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=898s)

I can imagine, Melissa, that would be so like conflicting. And in a very similar way, so the Brethren were never allowed to have fax machines. And I remember speaking to somebody who got kicked out for having a fax machine and they're out, they're gone. And they went through all the trauma of everything over a, you know, bloody fax machine. And I just remember when they told me that they now have, you know, now that the Brethren have fax machines and there's no, like there's [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=928s) restrictions around them, you just have fax machines.

The anger they felt through because of the trauma they went through for the suffering they went through over a fax machine. And I do wonder like with, in particular the Brethren, I guess is obviously over time they're going to have to loosen up on certain things or whether they recruit or whatever because they don't do that and it's very hard to maintain a group longevity wise. And I just, I wonder what they will change to, you know, as the course goes on and how people will react. Because I know that it really triggered them. Like it was, and that was just a fax machine. Like and it's very easy to [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=974s) it, I guess, but when you've gone through all the trauma over something like that and then they flip the script the next day, it can be so soul crushing. Like it makes it sort of invalidates everything you went through, right?

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=986s)

Exactly. And I was telling when my sister was talking to me about this yesterday, because this is just a small example, there's much bigger things too that are happening within the church. But my mom who's still LDS, I said, I was like, it's not the changes itself, it's the fact that in like a few more years, I'm gonna be gaslit that that's how they never were. That's that's more problematic because as things happen and it's not the youth of this generation's fault, they're going to grow up where those rules did not [apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1017s), right?

And so everything they've ever known, like the church that they're growing up in is just a different church than what I grew up in. And I can't blame them for that, right? Like it's not their fault that they have these freedoms that I wasn't able to have. But at the same time, they're going to go out preaching and saying, oh no, we're not in charge of what you wear. That's between you and God, when I had a specific list and I would get some, you know, like all these things. And it's the, it's the gaslighting portion of it that I think feels so awful.

And then [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1047s) are people within the mainstream LDS church too that like you're saying got actually kicked out. There's a guy, his last name is Young, but he fought so hard so that children, he said children should not be in one-on-one interviews with bishop, middle-aged men alone. He should not be able to do worthiness interviews. There's questions that shouldn't be allowed to be asked to children. And he fought for that so hard that the church excommunicated him for that. And then a few years later, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1077s) church comes out, we've had wonderful inspiration that children shouldn't be alone in these interviews and parents can be with your children.

And aren't we so wonderful for deciding this as an organization? Isn't this so wonderful? Most members hadn't heard about Brother Young that had been fighting for that for years. All they see is look at how amazing our church is, look at how great, how awesome is it that we have the foresight to do this so that children can be safer.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1101s)

And look how bad he is for fighting against the church. And that's why...

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1104s)

And he's still excommunicated. And that's why I got kicked out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1107s)

That we had that in the Brethren where someone was pushing for like, why can't we have computers? And so on. He got kicked out for it. And then suddenly, okay, yeah, it's all fun to have computers. And then of the guy who was, you know, had pushed for them early, it was said, well, he went ahead of the Lord. Yeah, that's what years, wow. You can't go ahead of the Lord.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1130s)

Yeah.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1131s)

So they probably give us some time and say, that's a great idea, you're out of here. You can't have the ideas, I need the ideas. And then wait a couple years and then say, aha, now's the time. 

**Richard Marsh**

Yeah, yeah. I mean, I just kind of got this mental image of some serious elder in the, in the LDS getting the call from God about the booty short regulation has changed. Right? Like who gets that? Like, oh, all of a sudden [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1162s) approve now.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1164s)

Oh my word.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1165s)

And something like that, that's just a silly one too, that there were ever rules and then to change the rules and say that doesn't matter, it almost seems, I don't know, coming from the FLDS perspective where I had to wear long sleeves and long pants and button-up shirts and all the girls were wearing these really long dresses down to their ankles and all the skin aside from hands and face had to be covered at all times. So to me, the mainstream LDS church, they were whoa, [skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1196s).

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1197s)

He could see my kneecaps when we were dating. So he was like, okay.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1201s)

I'll tell you what, the first time I saw, what female kneecaps look like. Yeah, exactly. I didn't realize women had knees. We were never allowed to see them. So yeah, it was interesting. So but anyway, exactly. Yeah. So but to see the church making changes like that for me, because of where I came from, it almost seems inappropriate that they're allowing such short shorts now.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1227s)

Well, you almost have to respect the consistency.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1230s)

If in the FLDS, right?

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1232s)

Not that I respect how what they do in the way that they have to dress, but like the respect, the consistency of if this is how God is and God is never changing and we choose to not change, there is that element of like, at least you're sticking to your guns. At least you have something that you're standing for, even if I disagree with it, I can be like, at least you're saying God doesn't change.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1253s)

Right. I mean, it's but at least it's consistently, exactly. Well, exactly. But then you look at these groups that aren't willing to change with society, and they're the ones that are being dissolved. The FLDS church is not going to last forever because they're not willing to go along with times. So it's no wonder that these mainstream or bigger churches are willing to make changes in order to survive.

**Ben Woodbury**

Yeah, which is such an interesting point you make, Sam, because I'm very intrigued as to how we're going to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1284s) these changes happen in the next 10 years. I mean, the current leader, he's, I think 71 and his dad died at 79\. So realistically, in the next 10 years, we probably will see another ascension. And which is an interesting point because we've, yes, we've had father-son ascensions before, but we've never had a third generation family member.

And I think, you know, in particular, it was Bruce Hales's sons that changed the technology thing that really, you know, sat down with their father and said, hey, we need [phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1314s), we need laptops, we need computers. And that's where that change came about. So they're a bit more radical, I guess you could say in terms of, you know, it clearly shows they're a bit more about money. And it makes me wonder, will they, you know, then recruit or will then they move to a bit more like the style of church you came from, Melissa, where it's a bigger mass scale and the rules kind of bend and change.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1343s)

Yeah. They have to, to survive for sure.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1346s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1346s)

I want to go back to Warren Jeffs. So, I mean, a lot of people that watch our podcast are insiders. They have like literally no clue about the documentary *Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey*.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1361s)

Yeah. And if they do, because most of them have Netflix now, please go and watch that documentary.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1367s)

Definitely go and watch that. I'll do a little blurb. I'll put up a picture here of what it looks like. Definitely, definitely go and watch that because it gives you the big picture of really what life was like inside that FLDS. But I've never spoken to someone from the FLDS. So what was your take on that documentary? And I guess one of the biggest questions I got is how does Warren influence, how does he still have his following from jail? How does that, how does he keep that control? And I mean, if Bruce is watching this, which he watches them, you might want to pick up a few pointers here.

### **Ben Woodbury**

In case you haven't watched it and you're listening to this on as a podcast, to give you some background, there's a really important scene, well, it shook me watching that documentary, where Warren Jeffs is in prison for essentially raping a 12-year-old or something, I think it was. And he, you see him behind the prison glass, and then you see all the members sort of file in and take up the chairs. And I think it's like men [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1436s) then women, in a very similar way that the Brethren sit, men and then women. And then they're there with their notepads taking orders from a convicted rapist as to the rest of the church.

And I just, in that moment, I was like, that would be my parents. They would be sitting there. It would be an honor to speak to the man of God behind prison bars, regardless of what the devil has said he has done and take orders. And just to give you some background as to that, if you're listening and haven't watched it. But yeah, I'm so interested to hear your point of view on that documentary, Sam.

**Sam**

Well, so first of all, watching it, it did look very familiar as far as the way of [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1474s), the different, so many familiar faces that I saw. You know, it was very well done. A lot of great coverage. Of course, if you're still in the FLDS church, you're going to say that was the most wicked abomination ever created in this entire earth because it paints Warren Jeffs in a bad light. 

My next point. Based on my experience in the FLDS church, I had no idea, no idea that the majority of the things shown in this documentary were happening. Because as a member in the church, you are so, it's crazy how little you know about the dealings of the leaders of the church. You see them drive around in their cars and pull into their home and the gates close behind them and they go into their garage. You see them [preaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1525s) at the pulpit in church meetings, but the majority of their time is done in secret. I had no idea the things that were being done behind closed doors in Warren Jeff's home.

So some of the stuff shook me as well. However, I did know that there were some very secretive and very bad things going on, and some of those were shown in the documentary, but the majority of them were just kind of a shock to me to see as well. And as far as, so that was my first thought when watching it. As far as why people would still believe Warren Jeffs, oh my gosh. Well, [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1569s) of like you said, it's, he has convinced them at this point that he is a man of God and that could do no wrong.

So even though he's put into prison from Satan and the workers for Satan, as they would say, he is still doing God's work. He never did anything wrong. It is just the government falsely imprisoning and putting him in prison. And that even if he did have any kind of sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old [girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1599s), even if that was proven, which they don't think it was, but they would still say that it was commanded by God. The only reason he did it is because God required it of him to pass a test or something like that.

So they'll use all kinds of different ways to justify what he does and just say that it is because that's what God wanted him to do. So it's very, it's not even surprising to me to see so many people continue to follow him. I recently spoke with an [active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1629s) member of the FLDS church that still believes Warren Jeffs is a prophet of God. I'm not going to say names to get anyone in trouble, but it was, it was kind of an accident that I ran into them and had this opportunity to speak with them. And they, to this day, don't believe anything that the news says he did.

They believe that he is a perfect man of God that is only in prison to pass a test. He's in prison because so many other prophets have been put in prison [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1660s) well, because they were just doing what God wanted them to do, and the world didn't like them for that. I mean, they would even look at him like Jesus in some ways, that he is being persecuted and not crucified, but in the same sense that it's because of the teachings of God the world hated him. And she still doesn't believe that he did these things and that he will eventually, they believe, be that he will break free, that he will walk free from the prison walls, will break down before [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1690s), and he will be able to come out and lead his people when God decides that that's the time for that to happen. Kind of like Paul and Silas, I guess, you know, the whole prison, they'll put in prison and and they used to refer to that like being in chains and you know.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1704s)

Yeah, it's...

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1706s)

Yeah, very interesting similarities, right?

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1709s)

But when he doesn't, when he dies there, he's going to be considered a martyr, the same as Joseph Smith.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1714s)

Yeah.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1715s)

So Joseph Smith was imprisoned and yeah, and I mean, like you said, there's many examples in the Bible as well. But more specifically Joseph Smith being imprisoned and if he's killed while he's in prison, then he's a martyr and that just proves even more his faithfulness in that he is doing what he's supposed to be doing for God.

One thing I did want to mention too, is there's such a lack of information for the FLDS people. And so even when Sam was living out there, you know, they're [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1745s) allowed to have any internet. They're not allowed to have internet on their cell phones. So while things were happening in real time of like Warren Jeffs running from the law, a lot of them, they knew he was running from the law. They didn't even know what he was running from.

And I remember when we were watching *Keep Sweet, Pray and Obey*, like us pausing and Sam was like, all the pictures they had of Warren like at Disney World or Disneyland, whatever.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1771s)

Or just wearing T-shirts.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1773s)

Or just wearing T-shirts and stuff. He stopped and you could tell he was shook. He was like, I've never seen, I had no idea. I was told that he was running from the law and he was building Zion, which the members had no idea where Zion was, that it even was in Texas. They had no clue. People would disappear in the middle of the night and when they would come back, they weren't allowed to say anything to anybody else that wasn't worthy of Zion, wasn't allowed to know.

So there's such a lack of information that the average member or like Sam's family [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1803s) just living their life, reading the Bible, reading the Book of Mormon, doing what they're told, trying to live good lives, trying to do what the prophet wants them to do. Like they're living normal within their society, just normal lives, not realizing that there were such young brides either. That's something that a lot of people leave and especially older men leave. And they're like, we didn't even know. Because if you weren't a man who got the young bride and you weren't within Warren's immediate circle, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1834s) were plenty of people who didn't even know that there were underage brides or knew that they were, oh, some were younger, but not 12-year-olds. There's a whole information disconnect with what people knew and Warren did that on purpose.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1849s)

Yeah, it was so many of the things he did, he did in secret. I mean, he ended up with about 80 wives and the majority of those wives were done, were married to him in secret by his, I quote unquote, power of God. So it wasn't obviously nothing legal, but they would go hide out in a home or hide out in a hotel and the girl would be dropped off and he would marry himself to her. And it was all this supposed [sacred,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1881s) secretive things that as a member at the time, thank God I was never a part of it in real life.

But at the time living out there, I felt so bad that I wasn't a part of the things going on, that I wasn't going to Texas, that I wasn't more in the loop with those surrounding Warren Jeffs, because I even had some of my own siblings that suddenly disappeared for a few days. Then all of a sudden, everything that they were [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1911s) was kind of whispered. Everything was just a big secret. I felt so out of the loop and so unworthy that I wasn't in the loop.

Now looking back, obviously, I see the things that were shown there in *Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey*, which by the way, just from an insider's perspective, even though I wasn't familiar with everything going on at the time, I believe everything they show was done. I don't think it was a show put out there to lie about the FLDS. I do believe that the show is accurate, [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1944s) the most part, at least. But yes, it's very hard to watch, especially being there during the time that most of this happened.

**Ben Woodbury**

But once again, not surprising at all that people are still believing in and following Warren Jeffs. It's very, very similar to the Brethren in that sense, I guess, isn't it? Like in the way that information is withheld and then the access to and then what really actually just struck me when you're saying, Sam, which I can so relate to in so many ways, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=1977s) the sense of of missing out or not being a part of. And I think for most of, for me, most of my life, I felt a lot like that until you had some sort of connection or that gives you a sense of identity or worthiness to in the same way with the leadership or the structure of the Brethren.

Like you have the Hales family and you have the Hales sort of relations and then you have the close network of friends around. And if at any point at all you can be [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2007s) part of or be in the presence of, it automatically gives you some sort of sense of superiority or being part of the group or the know. And like in a way that my dad, you know, in lunches or dinners would always, if he had heard from somebody from Sydney that had been with at the Hales, it was of great, you know, he felt I think a sense of importance by delivering, you know, we heard fresh today from our brother this and I heard it directly from [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2037s) in the same way that I think I sort of found a sense of purpose or confidence, I guess, in working for the leader's son-in-law.

It kind of, I saw the effect it had on people when you'd say where you worked and all of a sudden people that didn't respect you turned around and were like, wow, tell me what, what's this or what's that. In a very similar way, it's like you were not a part of it and you had, you have the Brethren have these grassroots Brethren that just are the average [families](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2067s) that are reading the Bibles and the ministries, paying the bills and they wouldn't know half the things that are happening because of the lack of communication unless you're part of the circle. Like unless you're part of the upper, like they wouldn't know about the ATO raids. And in a very similar way, because I came from a lower echelon family, I didn't know that all the people at the top had iPhones or most of them had open access computers until I was there and saw it. And that's when I guess the rift comes and [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2097s) start to question everything.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2098s)

Yeah, when you can start seeing, peeking behind the curtain, right? Yes, yeah. And you can realize and you see that like, oh, maybe it's an organization instead of this all-powerful church.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2109s)

Yeah, and I mean, that's how they really keep the followers though, by not letting them have that information. And I remember when I came out with my sister with what had happened to me and I was trying to, you know, relate some information back and forth because she was a part of some stuff. And I remember her just saying, you know, Cheryl, I want you to know that 99.9% of the stuff you hear is lies. And they truly believe that when they don't realize if I was to go and send her [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2139s) that I knew, right, she wouldn't, she would 100% discredit it all because to her, they're so programmed in there that anything, any knowledge that any of us have, it's just lies. It's just lies. The news lies that any kind of document, it's all documentaries, but it's all lies.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2158s)

Yeah. And the crazy thing is they actually believe it. They're not Just saying that because they want you to stop saying what you're saying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2168s)

They believe.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2168s)

They actually believe that it's all lies because that's what they're being told. Exactly.

**Richard Marsh**

 I mean, in Bruce Hales's ministry, there's actually an index, it's like a four volume index, subject index of his ministry. So you can look up any subject and it actually gives a whole series of little kind of two sentence quotes of what he said on that subject. If you look up journalists, there's dozens pages of quotes about journalists and every one he says journalists are liars. Journalists [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2199s), the man of sin is going to be a journalist.

And he hates journalists. And of course, the reason he says all this is because there's always bad press about the Brethren. So if you can paint journalists who are always liars, then of course, it helps the Brethren not to believe what they read in the newspaper about Bruce Hales and about the church. Absolutely. Unless a journalist came out and said something positive, then suddenly there would be a journalist that was fantastic.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2226s)

What kind of impact did that documentary have on not just the people who had left, but anybody that maybe you're still in contact with inside? Did it have an impact inside there?

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2238s)

So it's hard to say. I don't think that many people inside that fully believe in Warren Jeffs anyway, because there are people with one foot in, one foot out. But the ones that believe in him fully, I think that they never even saw it or probably never even heard about it.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2259s)

They're not allowed to watch TV.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2261s)

Right. But for those that have one foot in, one foot out, I think it impacted them in a big way. I will say that if you're still semi in the religion, it's hard to watch something like that. I remember when I first left, I wouldn't really even want to watch or read anything about the FLDS church because I was still programmed to believe it was all lies. So I assumed that if I saw it, it would just be lying.

And so it took a few months before I felt comfortable going and [looking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2291s) stuff up and realizing that, wow, there's a lot more to this story than I realized because so many people coming out, sharing their own experiences, you know, I mean, the majority of the time, what do they have to gain? Why would they just lie about their experience, especially if it's about abuse or something like that. Why would they come out and tell the public that they were sexually abused by someone within their group? Why would they want that type of attention? It doesn't make [sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2321s) why they would lie about that.

And so when I started hearing more and more stories and people coming out and getting to know some of these people, that's when I realized that there's a lot of truth to these documentaries, a lot of truth to these stories being told. And so anyway, I think it did have a big effect on people, but not right in the beginning, at least for those that were still believing somewhat in the [church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2351s).

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2351s)

I think it gave people who had already left that didn't know the full story, like Sam, right? And a lot of other people, it gave them closure of that, it sealed the deal that I did make the right choice, that there was more. Because like Sam, when he left, he was leaving because of lifestyle choices. Hey, I want to be able to date, I want to be able to watch movies. It wasn't about the doctrine of the church or who Warren Jeffs was.

And you see that a lot too, where people will leave or they'll get kicked out and they still feel like these [awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2382s) sinners that are not worthy and they're trying to earn their worthiness back. And I feel like it made the biggest impact on people like that. People who'd been kicked out, kind of forgotten, but were still trying to like find a way back to their families. And they see this and they go, wait, what am I trying to earn my way back to? This is a lie. Like, look at what Warren, he's the one that I'm like writing letters to apologizing and repenting to. Right.

And then they're finding out this information about him being like, okay, wait a minute. And they're reevaluating whether [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2412s) not like they even want to go back to being a part of that group. I'd say that's probably the biggest demographic of people who did still watch it and would see it, but realizing, oh, there was more bad than what I realized. It wasn't mostly good with this one bad thing that happened to me. There's a lot of bad and I just didn't see it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2431s)

Yeah.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2432s)

You know, one of the most impactful things, and I'm trying to remember if this was shown in *Keep, Sweet, Pray, and Obey*, I believe it was. I guess I can ask you guys, did you see when Warren Jeffs admits that he's a fallen prophet, that he's not actually a prophet of God? Did that show up in documentary?

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2449s)

We've watched so many documentaries. I don't remember.

### [**Get a Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2451s)

I don't remember that specific detail. I mean, for me personally, just due to what I went through, the most pivotal thing that hit me was the end, right? Like it was, yeah, right. So I don't remember that, no.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2463s)

Okay, I'd have to watch it. And there will be things that stick out to every different person depending on the journey where they're at in their journey. So that makes sense. But there was a point, and this, I think the reason, and this is so printed on my brain is because it was so hard to hear when I first left the FLDS church. But Warren Jeffs admitted in prison that he was never a prophet. He said, I am a fallen prophet. I've been a liar. And all [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2493s) these things on camera, he said this.

And people had recordings of it. And when I saw that, even though I had chosen to leave the church, it was like my whole world was shattered because I knew him. I had listened to his sermons for years. I had shaken his hand many, many times. I've been to his house. I know him. And for him to say that after this godlike figure in the community, it just shook my world. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2524s) I think that was something for a lot of people that was just like, wow, I can't believe he actually said that.

And you're probably wondering now, okay, if he said that, why in the world are people still following him? Well, guess what? He had done such a good job at convincing people that he was the prophet of God, too good of a job, because when he tried to finally escape and say, just kidding, guys, I don't want this. His followers convinced him that he was just having a [moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2554s).

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2555s)

This is a test, right?

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2560s)

You're a prophet. This is a test and we're gonna pass. We know, we know that that's not true. We know that you really are the prophet.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2565s)

So suddenly after he had, after he had already admitted that he wasn't the prophet, his, I think it was his brother specifically convinced him that he was the prophet. Like, hold on, wake up here, you are the prophet, you're just going through a time here. Then it was not very long, I think a few weeks later, all of a sudden Warren Jeffs has this big revelation and this big visitation in prison and starts writing these what he calls revelations for the people. And they have just gotten worse and [crazier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2595s) and more intense ever since. And now of course he claims he is the prophet of God.

So it is, but still, they do say that once you put somebody on a pedestal, it's very hard to get them off. Right. Well, and it was hard for me to hear that even though I was already outside of the church, it was still hard for me to see him try to step off that pedestal. I'm like, no, dude, who, you can't, you can't get off of there. You already have shown these people this many [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2625s) that you are the prophet. So just to show the, I guess dedication that the people have and the ability to hold someone as this perfect person, even if you see them do something you don't agree with.

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Yeah. And do you think they start believing their own lies in time? I mean, they live in this echo chamber where everyone thinks that everything they say is perfect. So no one dares disagree with them. If someone went into Hales' inner circle and he made a suggestion and that person disagreed, that person's kicked [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2655s). And so surely it must be very hard to keep your sanity and your sense of proportion where no one ever disagrees with you. Right.

And so I wonder if they actually end up, you know, even if they when they started out on their path of being a prophet, they knew that they were naughty teenagers and had actually sinned and done bad stuff. And they were just doing this because it was like, well, you know, I can make a lot of money by pretending to be the prophet. I wonder if towards the end of their lives, they get this kind of psychosis [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2686s) they actually believe their own previous 50 years of lies and really think they are the big cheese.

**Sam**

Right. Oh, 100%. I think that's very accurate. I think that they do get to a point, and here's the thing, maybe not to that extent, but I do know even within churches, just the members, not the leaders, just the members, you get to this point where you can convince yourself, even if at first you didn't feel right about something, if you tell yourself enough that it's true, if you tell yourself [self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2716s) enough that it's okay, eventually it becomes true and okay.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2719s)

Well, and why would you want to have all of your life's work and something that you've dedicated your whole life to, to admit that it's wrong? And then what was your life for when it's an all encompassing type of religion, right? Like there's times where people will ask, oh, what, you know, Sam, your father, do you think he'd ever leave? He's like 84 years old right now. What would actually be the point at this point for him to have his whole life's work and everything, all the sacrifices he's had, his wives taken away, he's had children become apostates, he's gone through so much. And what he has left is still his faith. And is it, yeah, like what, I don't see what good, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2764s) it's just, it's so almost like...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2766s)

That's all that's left of him or something. Like it's his identity, right? 

**Richard Marsh**

I mean, it's scary. I mean, imagine coming to your deathbed and realizing that your entire life has been dedicated to something that's actually completely fake.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2779s)

So one of the last questions I have that I know will want to be answered is what was the abuse like inside either the LDS or the FLDS? And were authorities ever involved? Like we're in the PBCC, authorities are very much, you know, not involved at all. Everything's kind of shoved underneath the rug. And in abuse, I'm asking about sexual abuse and spousal abuse. Like if there was, if there was any of that that you [witnessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2809s) or you've heard from leavers that have left now.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2813s)

Oh my gosh. I guess I'll start with, I'll start with the FLDS. And then if you want to chime in at all, you can. In the FLDS church, let's just start off by saying anything sexual was not allowed to be talked about. So parents didn't go to their children and say, hey, we need to have to talk about the birds and the bees. And we need to talk about what's okay. If a man treats you this way, it's okay. If he does this, it's not okay. Things you need to look out for, red flags, those kinds of things were never, ever talked about in the FLDS church.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2848s)

And there's no such thing as consent really either.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2851s)

Exactly.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2851s)

You don't even get to pick who you get married to, let alone what you're allowed to consent to.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2855s)

Because all of the marriages are arranged. And the first time they hear about, in a lot of cases, the first time they even know what sex is, is after getting married. And at that point, the one person that dictates if it's how to do it, how it's supposed to be done, is the husband. And that's the only experience they've ever known. So I say all this because even if abuse is happening in a lot of cases, they wouldn't know that it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2886s) abuse. Because that's all they have been taught. That's all they know is what's being done to them in that moment.

So therefore it must be okay. So I want to start off by just saying that because abuse, whether they would say it's abuse or not, it's up to their individual experiences. Now, people that have left, yes, they're unfortunately by Warren Jeffs himself. And then also people that he would force together, close cousins in some cases, that would, they felt very uncomfortable because they were raised around each other. They knew about each other. And they knew that they knew this other person and in some cases didn't like this cousin. But Warren Jeffs would force them to get married.

And then it was just this awful, awkward situation. There are stories out there from, I'm forgetting her name right now, Elissa Wall. She was a big name in the *Keep Sweet, Pray and Obey* documentary. She shares her story about having to get married to her cousin, forced by Warren Jeffs, this cousin that she did not like. And that she knew was 14\. And she was only 14 [years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2955s) old. And she knew that he was not a very kind person. And so then, of course, after she was forced to marry him, then he abused her against her will. And well, of course, against her will. It was abuse.

But so these kinds of things did happen a lot. Thankfully, in my own family, I did not see that kind of thing. I had a father that, yes, he was the one in charge. And yes, everyone was supposed to just obey him no matter what. But I didn't see him especially [physically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=2985s) abusing his wives or my mother ever. I never, ever saw that in my own home. And then as far as verbally abusing, that's a tough one because it depends on who you ask and which religion you belong to, whether or not you're going to believe or think that it's a verbal abuse or not. So in my personal experience, I did not witness any sexual abuse, but I do know that it did happen.

### [**Get a Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3015s)

And were authorities ever called? Like were police ever involved or no?

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3020s)

In the FLDS church, at least at the time that I lived there, the authorities or the police were also being controlled by Warren Jeffs and they were members of the FLDS church. How convenient, am I right? But not only that, the women didn't feel that they had any right to voice concerns because of the way they were raised to just follow the man and let him be in charge. And in some very small cases or [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3050s) few cases, when any woman did try to stand up like Elissa Wall, she was very harshly rebuked by Warren Jeffs. Like, how dare you question my authority? How dare you question your husband's authority? So they were so afraid to stand up. If even if they did try call 911, guess what? FLDS police officers at your door and doing what Warren Jeffs wants him to do anyway.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3078s)

Well, and for wives, we've been given, like I have the pamphlets and the worksheets that the young girls would have to prepare to be the wives. Like they would have classes, right, that these young girls would go to on how to be a wife and mother. And I have a lot of those pamphlets and booklets that they were being taught from in their textbooks. And it specifically says that basically they make the women the scapegoat in the community.

So it's the woman's job [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3108s) raise her children in righteousness. It is, so if any of her children leave, those sins will be on her head for eternity. It is her job to make sure that she supports her husband in his priesthood. And I remember reading one verse that was like, and if your husband is not being worthy of his priesthood, you need to lightly correct him or ask him privately and never embarrass him like in front of other people or try to bring it up to other [priesthood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3139s) leaders or the prophet, because that would disgrace your husband's priesthood if it got brought up to other priesthood.

So basically there is no way for you to like report it without saying like some kind of dishonor to your husband or his priesthood. Because if you tried to tell the prophet, well, you're telling on your husband and that's dishonoring his priesthood. But if he is dishonoring his priesthood anyway, then that's your responsibility to somehow correct him, but don't correct him.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3168s)

Yeah.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3168s)

So there's no way for the women to win in this case because no matter what happens to them, and like Sam said, the women who did try to say, hey, my husband's abusive, rarely got the time of day. I think I've only heard what, one or two stories of where like a woman was just super resilient, going back, okay, hey, he's abusive, he's abusive, like physically abusive, like beating her children and like breaking bones and was going to the prophet like every day for months and months and [months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3198s) and finally was able to have him like removed from her being her husband. But we're talking like horrible, like breaking legs type of abuse there to make that actually happen.

And so it's, yeah, it's just not a thing. The reason that that documentary is called “*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey”* is because the words "keep sweet" is what everybody in the community, but particularly the women, were constantly told to keep sweet. You keep a smile on your face. And like I said, [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3228s) pamphlets of what these girls are being taught, it's all about pure obedience, pure obedience to your husband, pure obedience to the prophet. And you keep a smile on your face and you make sure you don't complain and you don't speak up and you don't say anything against priesthood period.

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3246s)

The phrase "keep sweet" was looked at as a very positive thing when I was in the community as, oh yeah, we're just here doing God's work and we'll have trials and hard times, but if we can prove that we're going to remain faithful and happy no matter what. And that's something to add on as well is the phrase wasn't just keep sweet. Rulon Jeffs, Warren's father, started this phrase and the whole phrase was "keep sweet no matter what." So that was the full, that was the full phrase, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3276s) meaning yes, just listen to the leaders, obey the leaders, be happy about it, shut up.

**Ben Woodbury**

Just thinking about what you were saying before, Melissa, if you're a woman listening to this from the Brethren. Like, yes, it's not all spelt out like this. And there's no pamphlets. There's no, you know, written out guidelines on how to act, but it's exactly the same. You are the same person. You don't have a voice. I've heard [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3306s) one divorce in the Brethren, and that's because of the horrific abuse that she was going through. And I guess that the only other alternative was for her to leave and they didn't want that. They didn't want it out. So it's very, very similar.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3319s)

Unless you're one of those women, right, who has come to a priest and complained about it and then what were you told? You were told, well, you know, maybe you're not pleasing your man enough, right? So even though these aren't in pamphlets, if you are one of those women that are still being abused in there, like you may as well have a pamphlet that says that.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3340s)

Well, and just something that I mean for your viewers or just women out there in general, anybody that's listening, I, like Sam had mentioned before, it's hard sometimes for women who aren't taught what abuse is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3353s)

Yes.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3353s)

What is abuse? Okay. Well, I'm not being abused. Women have an intuition. You have it in your heart. And if something doesn't feel right, it's not right. And you need to listen to that and understand that it's okay for you to acknowledge that. And someone doesn't need to tell you that it's right around. You'll be able to feel when something's not right and that's the voice that you need to listen to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3379s)

Yeah, I agree. Okay, well, so is there anything that you would like to say to anyone with one foot in, one foot out in a high demand religious group?

### [**Sam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3392s)

Oh man. Well, go ahead. You go ahead. Okay. I would just say that remember that no matter what you've been told, there is happiness and joy in the outside of the little bit that you know about the big world. There is so much to learn, so much to enjoy. There's great, wonderful people. I experienced that for myself. It was just life-changing for me to meet so many wonderful [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3422s) on the outside, even though in my mind, because of the way I was taught, they were all wicked and being controlled by Satan. But just know that I've experienced and can say firsthand that there is a lot of good in this world.

### [**Melissa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3435s)

Yes, I would also add on to that to not be afraid to ask someone a question. Especially if you're in a group that has people who have left. I remember being so scared to ask people questions because I was afraid that it would hurt my faith. And as I was starting to be willing to reach out to people, being willing to ask questions of why somebody else chose to leave and then be patient with yourself, I guess would be my last thing. Be patient with your journey because [everybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3466s) comes out at a different rate. You might think that you're going to end up one place and end up somewhere completely different. Be patient with yourself on the journey coming out as you explore and discover what you do believe and where you feel like life will bring you the most joy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvbRWspwJq0&t=3486s)

Yep. So beautifully said, have as much compassion for yourself as you possibly can muster up. That is, compassion gets you a long, long way. Well, I really appreciate you guys coming on.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
