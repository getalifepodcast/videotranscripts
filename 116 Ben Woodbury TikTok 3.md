This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=11s)

Hey there, and I'm sure most of you are well aware by now that I was born into a cult here in Sydney, Australia, and I escaped that seven years ago. Hi, if you're new here, let me give you some interesting facts, main points about this religion. You probably know them because they keep very separate. They have this strict rule of separation, they do not eat with outsiders, outsiders cannot come to their church meetings as much as they want the world to think they're a public place so they can get charitable status and therefore tax [benefits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=41s).

They also have very strict rules around within the religion, so you cannot have mobile phones, internet, radio, television, you can't go to movies, you can't go to football games. They have their own schools. So it's a commune, but psychologically they seamlessly integrate into society. You know, half the members, they are a worldwide group, but about 30,000 plus are here in [Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=71s) with a majority being around Sydney because that's where the leader is.

So they're very skilled businessmen. That's why they have a lot of money. They make a lot of great deals and clever accounting. So they make a lot of money. But some interesting facts, I believe they're a doomsday cult because they believe in the second coming of Jesus, and they call it the rapture, where he will basically rescue them out of the end of the world. So the world goes to shit and because they are the shit, they get rescued. There's a scripture to back that up in Revelation somewhere where they say they are peculiar people zealous for good works. So peculiar, yes, but not that zealous for good works, which if you follow my stories, you'll find out why. And I'll share more about them as well.

Another interesting thing is they only ever get married on a Tuesday because, well, you know, Jesus turned up to that wedding on the third day where he made the water into wine. So you know who I'll be inviting to my wedding with lots of bottles of water, which will become wine. No jokes.

And what was another interesting thing is that the women will always have to wear a token in their hair. So again, the women are not allowed to wear pants. They don't speak up in church. They have a very sort of secondary role in there because they are the weaker sex. Yes, they are very homophobic and very sexist. So the women have to wear a token in their hair, so the angels will look down and go, oh, that's a woman. We better give her an extra bit of protection because, well, she's the weaker sex. So that adds to that whole narrative of they are the weaker sex, they don't speak up, and [men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=166s) rule the roost basically, or run the world.

And another interesting thing, once you leave, you are excommunicated and you're taught all your life, you're better off to die than to leave. So it's very, very traumatic to leave. So I've had a lot of you ask, was I pushed to get married? What were my options? You know, how did that look for a gay man, a closeted gay man? So just briefly, my parents were in an arranged marriage. So I knew I had that option, which wasn't really an option for me because I didn't want to marry a woman because I couldn't be honest, [firstly,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=200s) with myself or with her, and I didn't want to be that disappointment.

Secondly, the second option, which I knew they'd tried on a gay man before, and I was terrified because it happened in Sydney, and the doctor that did that, the brethren doctor, had his practice closed down over it, but they chemically castrated a young gay man. Like such pre-60s, 70s, 50s mindset. You know, like they would probably lobotomize somebody if they could, because that's how [uneducated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=234s) they are in terms of things like sexuality.

So for me, I knew chemical castration was another... that's what I'd heard, you know, that I knew they did this to this man. So I thought that was a possibility, a very real possibility they were going to do that to me.

Thirdly, the third option was to escape, which I didn't know how to do. I didn't have any friends outside. I didn't know anybody outside. There was no way of communicating or contacting people outside without, you know, you're constantly under a microscope, without getting in so much trouble. And also, I knew what it cost to leave. You know, you're excommunicated when you leave. Your family has to erase you from their photos. They have to erase you from their life. They cannot speak about you. The photo books they have, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=282s) I'll share photos of at one point, you know, you're erased from their very photo books. They record the deaths of people in that, but people that leave, they scratch them out. So it's like you don't exist. So that was a very real thing, and I didn't know how I was going to work with that.

The fourth option, the only option I really saw was suicide. And so, you know, I did try to commit suicide. Obviously, I had a moment within that of reality, thinking that there is a possibility, you know, that small glimmer of hope that I could [leave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=312s). I knew that I had two uncles that had left years and years ago, got kicked out, and obviously had survived the worst. So from there, I started to prepare over the next six years. And it took me six years from then, to around about six years, to leave. Because you have to come to terms with it mentally. It's more the emotional endurance and the mental endurance to be able to leave your own family.

Now your questions here, and I've had a few people ask this, do the brethren seem to have a particular industry that they, or business type, they deal with? As you may know or not know, the brethren are very business-oriented. Money is their driving force.

And so you'll notice, and some people have said, oh, they all seem to be in healthcare, or they all seem to be in safety, or they all seem to be in building. They tend to pick, or you know, certain people... start that again. The higher you are in the brethren is related to money and close association to the Hales family. And that is the royal family of the brethren, the family where the [leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=385s), the leader's family is. And so if you have more money, it's usually from your business, right? So they sort of copy, there's like a copycat sort of influence that seems to follow out through the lower echelons of the Brethren society.

So for example, the Hales family business, for example, if they did office fit-outs and interiors and it went well because you have all the best of the best working for you [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=416s) the business brains sort of supporting you, of course, it's going to go well. Well, the rest of them kind of go, well, that works for them. Let's do something similar. So in the same way that you'll find a lot did do safety or a lot have done PPE or like interiors for healthcare environments. And it usually ends up being like taking money from [government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=446s) institutions, that type of thing, where it's easy money and big money.

Because, you know, they require a lot of money. It's an expensive lifestyle to be a brethren. And also, particularly when you've got to pay for hefty court cases to, in my experience, outprice mothers that want to save their children from a cult or an abusive upbringing. You know, you need money to be able to outprice them with getting the best lawyers. So you know, even if your case that you're supporting is an abuser, they'll still win. And this has happened currently with a, happening currently and yeah, more to come on that. But yeah, thank you for your questions and yes, they all seem to be in a similar business [group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=495s) because, well, they're very contained and the leaders are very influential in that.

Yes, sorry, this one was about divorce. You're right. Yes, this is correct. If somebody leaves, the person that's still in the brethren is, and they're married, is allowed to divorce them. But what I was talking about is people within the, if in the religion or in the cult, if they have an abusive relationship or an abusive partner, you can't just separate and go back to your family home or live your life as a divorcee because there is no divorce. So if somebody is excommunicated or leaves the relationship, then the person still in the brethren is allowed to get a divorce.

And somebody else asked on this thread about annulment. I don't really know what that is, but like, as in making the children that you have illegitimate. No, I've never heard that. They don't really consider [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=555s) anything like the Catholic church because they feel like that is what has gone wrong with Christianity.

Meanwhile, you know, they're a safe haven for molesters and abusers. So, I mean, what really has gone wrong there as well? So yeah, I don't really know much about the annulment because that's not something I was familiar with and I didn't see that happening. And I don't think it would, just given their strict rules around, we're family-orientated, nothing ever goes wrong with family, and covering up any family drama.

So hey everyone, a couple of little fun facts about me that you probably would never [assume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=594s). First one, I grew up in a cult that didn't allow me to watch television, movies, read books, have music, any sort of entertainment or influence from the outside world, internet. Second fun fact, I was in the latest Thor movie. Don't believe me? Have a look at this.

And here is me sitting next to Russell Crowe. I know, I'm painted solid gold and wearing a helmet. And I just love the irony of this, that, you know, I was the boy that grew up with no TV, no movies, raised in a cult, you know, and my father told me all my life, I'd never amount to anything or do anything or be anything. And I would be in a gutter, you know, and this is just one of the little wins for me because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=647s) love the irony of that. I wasn't allowed to watch movies and I ended up in one. And I know I'm like only a small part, but to me, this was just such an amazing experience.

Yeah, it really, it was really, yeah, mind-blowing. It was one of those moments in life where you will never sort of, I don't think I'll ever surpass that moment. But, you know, I want to use this to, you know, maybe help someone else in a similar situation in there that you can do whatever the fuck you want. You can be whoever you want out here. And look, while being an actor or being in movies isn't my thing, I did it just because I [wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=690s) to and I could and I did. It was just, yeah, it was such a great experience.

And to anybody that's stuck in the Exclusive Brethren cult like I was for 24 years of my life, take a chance, open a door and start planning, you know, for a better life. And whilst this is, you know, as materialistic as this may sound, it's not just all about this, but this is just one small little win I wanted to share to show that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=720s) can do anything you want. You can live a happy, peaceful life out here. Because what are the odds that a cult boy that wasn't allowed internet or to watch movies ends up in one? Very slim odds, but it's possible. I did it. You can. Yeah, just a little, little exciting win that I love to share with people.

An interesting fact that not many people would know. Obviously, as you may be well aware, I was born into this [cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=750s). My parents were, my grandparents, so it's a generational cult, 138 years old. And I'm answering your questions. If you've got any questions, just put them in the comments and I'm trying to get back to them all with a video. So hopefully I'm answering a few questions at once because I can see that some are similar, but don't worry if they are, just ask away.

So this one is a really good question I want to address. Are there support services to accommodate and give therapy immediately after escaping a cult, especially those born into it? [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=781s) pretty much everybody that's ever escaped it is born into it because the brethren don't recruit, they only breed, for want of a better word. And that's how they keep their numbers. They're not really about getting numbers, they're happy that they're a smaller minority. They're more of a doomsday cult, which I would love to talk more about. They believe in the rapture, the second coming of Jesus. So they're not really about furthering their lineage, so to speak, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=811s) creating more members.

So when I left, I didn't really know about therapy, and you don't know about it in there. It's a very witchy, voodoo subject. I remember once my mom going to a naturopath and, you know, as soon as one of the ladies that she went for me and my sister, and I remember when my sister went, she said, oh, I think, you know, maybe your parents weren't compatible, you might need some sort of therapy. My mom was up and out. Like [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=841s) not something they condone.

It's very witchy, voodoo, basically. They think psychiatry, like anyone dealing with mental health for therapy, because it will obviously change your mind, they think is of the devil. You know, it will change your views of being of the situation you're in because most of the people in there need therapy because they're in such a toxic, high-pressure society that they don't cope. And that's why they are so heavily dependent on alcohol.

So unfortunately, there isn't. And you know, it took me five years to get therapy. And I've had it for, you know, I've [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=877s) out for seven, so I've had therapy for maybe three years now. And it has immensely changed not only who I am as a gay man, it's helped me recover, you know, from and heal from religious trauma that I suffered, from other abuses that I suffered. It's really defined who I am today and helped me on my journey. Like I am such an advocate for therapy and I always push the people that I help leave to get [therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=907s) immediately, just to help speed up that healing process, which, you know, takes a lifetime.

This question is, what kind of books did I read? As you may know, or if you haven't seen my videos because you're new here, I wasn't allowed to read books, music, any sort of entertainment, or anything that would influence me in terms of an outside world. So we lived a very separate life and reading was limited to children's books as a child. And then through high school, you were allowed to, you know, I used to [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=937s), oh, I've got to read this book for school, and your parents would look it over and sort of check it and make sure that that's what was happening. But they were constantly, particularly my dad, you know, while you're reading this, you know, you've done what, you turn 12 years old, you're done with the things of a child. So it's that mentality that from 12 years old, you are growing up, you are becoming a man.

And so the books I used to love as a kid were Famous Five, Secret Seven, Enid Blyton. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=967s) then that moved into, you know, I loved the adventure, that moved into Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden, just to name a few. I used to love Phantom comics, but they were such contraband. Like my dad would rip them up. I don't know why, but I think it might have been because he was a man in undies. I don't know.

And then as I grew up and got older, I loved things [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=997s) like Alexander Dumas's Three Musketeers or like the unabridged version, so the big thick books. My favorite of all time is The Count of Monte Cristo. I think that would be an amazing movie and I always had dreamt of Baz Luhrmann doing it because he's the only person that could do it justice, like he did The Great Gatsby. So yeah, those type of books. I loved The Scarlet Pimpernel and his stories of rescuing people. I guess it's kind of ironic [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1027s) that I'm doing a similar thing in rescuing people out of this cult.

And yeah, so a range of books. I don't read as much as I used to. I think I take that for granted now. This year in particular, I've tried to settle down and like pick a specific time to read, like particularly now in the morning or later at night. I love self-help books and then a bit of Greek mythology, like Song of Achilles, which is an amazing read if you haven't read it.

This is not a question, but this is funny because this is actually one of my old work colleagues that I used to work with in the [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1062s). And she was an outsider, I was an insider, and she knows that I used to get in trouble for like, you know, having been too familiar with outsiders, with herself. So hey, Linda.

But yes, and she said, this is why I upgraded you to USBs which would go into your underwear. And that's true. That's how severe and how secretive you used to have to be. So I got in trouble for swapping books with another work colleague. And then Linda, in order for me to get movies or music, you know, sinful things that were not, you know, were highly contraband in the brethren, yeah, Linda used to give them to me on a USB stick, which I had to put into my underwear, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1109s) you know, it's the only place they didn't search.

I literally, and I used to get home from work and my dad would stand in the doorway, open your bags, basically search me down like every second afternoon. Anytime he thought or heard, when he heard obviously from my manager that I was swapping books, he'd be in the doorway patting me down. And if my manager or any other brethren in there listening to this, the effects of you being so controlling [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1139s) stop with you, right? And you, you know, reporting on the people, it doesn't stop with you. The abuse, because this is abuse, coercive control happens at home as well. So I used to get home, have a pat down, search down from my own dad, and then I'd be allowed into the house. And his whole thing was always, this is my house, my rules. If you don't want to live here, go live somewhere else.

Go and live on the street. And you know what? Here I am living on the street, but I couldn't do that at 14, 15 years old. That was a threat from, you know, early teens or a child. And yeah, so you can understand how abusive and toxic and how traumatizing it has been. And this is why I'm so protective of my own space. And I love my life now. It's completely the opposite. I never thought it was possible to have this freedom, this peace out here [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1194s) I have. So if anybody in there is listening and are hiding USB sticks in their underwear, one day you don't have to. You can fucking go to a movie. You can read a damn book in a park and nobody's going to judge you. And if they do, it doesn't matter because you don't have to know them. You don't have to hang out with them. You only have to surround yourself with a few good people and your life is bliss.

Your question here is about the RBTs and because the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church are renowned for their [drinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1225s), their bad drinking issues, and how do they get around, you know, navigate driving. And I honestly, it used to always surprise me how much they would drink and then be comfortable hopping in the car and driving, putting their own family and other drivers on the road at risk. And it's happened recently with a Brethren member. There was an article in Victoria about a young brethren boy that, you know, was recklessly driving and, [allegedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1258s) from the media article, he's killed two, I think a brother and a cousin or something. I'll have to read the article again.

But the sad thing is, yes, he's at fault, but the sad thing is here is they will use him as an example of what God is saying to the brethren about, you know, everyone needing to shape up. You know, and rather than addressing the actual issue here, and that's the drinking culture in the Exclusive [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1288s), the excessive use of alcohol, their mentality, you know, as one of the leaders has said before, alcohol makes a strong man stronger and a weak man weaker. So it's that whole masquerade of being, well, I'm a man so I can drink, rather than, you know, understanding there is a critical issue amongst the brethren of notorious drinking and a culture that starts from like, as a child, you are fed alcohol at a ritual on a Sunday. You know, they feed you port [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1318s) in representation of Christ's blood. So it starts from an early age, that indoctrination that this is okay, this is part of life. And as you get older and older, you become more, you know, you use it as a crutch.

And how they navigate, you know, if they're ever caught or caught with drink driving, money. Money gets them out of everything. Expensive lawyers, they get off so easily because of money. And it's just a sad reality. Our [law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1348s) system here in Australia doesn't support women as much as it does men and lets people with money win whatever they fucking want. They can murder somebody and basically get away with it.

Okay, I thought I'd do a part two on this question about how the Exclusive Brethren navigate RBTs because I had a memory come back to me about an experience I had with growing up, what it was like. They're very heavy drinkers and I'm just talking about why and my experiences with that and why they're like that. So navigating RBTs on Sundays is the days they drink the most, and like ridiculous amounts. You start with this 6 a.m. ritual called the Lord's Supper meeting, where they have this cup filled with port in representation of his blood and they pass it around to every member, even babies. And [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1397s) everybody has to have a drink. And if you didn't, you were either notoriously an alcoholic and on some sort of watch, but you know, it was like, oh, the Lord will, you know, skip that part, don't worry about your alcoholism problem, just drink it and the Lord will look after you. That's their mentality.

And so with their Sunday meetings, they would have a lunch, an allocated lunch, where on Friday you'd get a list with who you have to have for lunch. Doesn't matter if you fucking hated the guy, you had to have that person for lunch. And that's when they'd consume all the alcohol. And there's a lot of alcohol, like no RSAs. It was just, I mean, I know it's not a public place, it's in their own homes, but like a ridiculous amount. Like I really had to, now I'm a lightweight compared to what I used to drink. Like [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1447s) was ridiculous how much you used to consume as a teenager or a young adult.

And I remember going between church meetings and I remember being part of a group chat they had to notify if there were, and I don't know if it was in other areas, but my area, they had a group chat that would notify if there was an RBT or a police car doing random breath tests or a cop or anything. They'd be like, cop on this road, blah, blah, use back streets. So I don't know if it was like they have that nowadays. I don't know if it's a particular app for that, but [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1484s) used to have their own group chat on BlackBerry Messenger. And yeah, they all used to report if there was an RBT and so that all the brethren would avoid that road because, well, they were well and truly over and were going to get caught. So yeah, that's how they used to literally avoid RBTs. But if they were caught, like I said in the previous video, it was money. They would get off with, you know, without, with lesser punishments for their crimes because they could afford expensive [lawyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1514s) because the brethren have a lot of money.

So a lot of you have asked about my relationship with my father and, you know, do I ever hear from him? So I left, escaped seven years ago. I never hear from him. I think I've reached out once, maybe twice. I hear more from my mom when I reach out than I do my dad. But I didn't have a great relationship with my father. He was extremely homophobic, emotionally abusive, just very manipulative. And he [had an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1544s) arranged marriage, so my mother hated him as well, but was forced to live with him.

And I just thought I'd share a small example of what my dad was like. So one Saturday night, this is a classic example. I never liked Saturday nights. They would always lock up the house like 9:30, you had to be in bed by latest 10 o'clock because, you know, the next day we had this early Sunday morning ritual that we had to get up for at the crack of dawn. And you had to be there. So [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1574s) know, they always like to make sure we were always in bed. So no fun Saturday nights for us.

But I went, I didn't like spending Saturday nights at home with my family. They were a very toxic family. So I used to just find solace in my car, you know, singing to Rihanna, which was sinful and illegal in the brethren anyway because you weren't allowed to have music from outside. So I left the house and I went, sat actually up in KFC car park, had my dinner [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1605s) just listened to Rihanna and was literally crying. That's what I did usually when I went off. I wasn't out taking drugs, I wasn't going to the movies, I wasn't hanging out with outsiders. I was just in my own company, grieving my life and trying to figure out how to get out and escape.

And I came home, my dad, you know, was furiously messaging me, get home, where are you? You know, answer your phone, because he was very controlling like that. He had to know where you were every 15 minutes, you know, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1635s) you live in my house, otherwise get out. And, you know, people, I know some of you said, why don't you just leave? I didn't know anyone outside. I didn't know how to leave. I had to learn all this.

So it's very daunting and scary because you're taught all your life you're better off to die than to leave and that you'll end up in the gutter. So that reality is a very scary one. And it's been very difficult to rewrite that narrative. I find myself still struggling with that today. Like I really struggle and stress about financial security. You know, that's why I work hard in my small business to make sure I never fall back or have to rely on them because I can't.

And I came home late and he had got all my bedding and put it in a bag with this note that says, "sleep in your car now." This is the type of manipulation and emotional abuse that I went through. I didn't have a home to come home to. So that night, you know, I had to sleep in my car.

Hey there, thank you for your questions and your interest about the cult that I was raised in here in Australia. Yeah, you thought we just had scary snakes and spiders that were toxic? No, we also have cults. I was raised [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1700s) the Exclusive Brethren and I escaped when I was 24, so about seven years ago. I'm showing my age. And a lot of you asked this and I want to reply. And just because I want to make it public, if I ever go missing, it's the brethren. I'm not even joking. But I've also spoken to the police. And yeah, so everybody is well aware of what's happening and I'm making it public.

Your question and a lot of others, I've been worried about my safety or retribution speaking out against them. I don't think collectively they'll come at me as a whole physically to, you know, make me disappear or anything, but they, you know, every now and then get the evangelical cult member that, you know, would be doing the Lord's work or, you know, a Christian crusader that will, you know, be doing our brother a favor. And when I say our brother, I mean the leader, the man of God, the elect vessel, and they could physically hurt me. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1754s) you know, I'm a big strong boy and can look after myself, but I'm always wary of that. So thank you for your concerns.

As to my physical safety, who knows, but I'll take each day as it comes. I'm not living in fear with looking over my shoulder all the time because that's what I did in the cult and I'm not doing that anymore. I'm an out gay man and I live a great life. I have a great community around me and all you supporters. And I've said it here publicly, so if anything happens to me, it's them. I've always said to my friends, if I go missing, if something happens, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1784s) not me, it's them.

And not to put that down in anybody's mind, but I just would like to know that I've said it and I feel comfortable saying it now I've said it.

But there are things that can come after me like legally or defamation and things like that. But I'm speaking of my experiences as a gay man in that cult, growing up in that cult, and they are extremely homophobic and they'll never go back on that. So I think I'm just sticking to my story. Eventually, I will help others to share their stories, you know, other victims that have come to me and spoke about their abuse, their rapes, the things that they've endured at the hands of brethren members. But at this point, I'm just sticking to my story. So thank you for everyone [offering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1826s) safe spaces and for this platform for offering a safe space to speak my story. I have a lot more to tell and share with you. It just takes a lot on my emotional durability and I'm very capable of talking and in touch with my emotions and mental health. So thank you for your concerns there also.

My only thought or concerns are, is what happens back in there? Because now I'm speaking out, they will have arranged prayer meetings for my death. That's something I used to do as a kid. You know, you'd go to a prayer meeting and pray for a certain person's death because they were speaking out. It's crazy.

Hey there, everyone. I've had a lot of you ask what I do for work and what my small business is, so I thought I'd share. So I'm usually talking about the cult I was raised in, but that doesn't define who I am and I would love to share more of my life with you, and that being my little shop. If you're familiar with Windsor or Sydney, I have a shop in Windsor, New South Wales, sort of at the foot of the Blue Mountains. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1897s) kind of a cute, historic little town and I have like a homewares, furniture, giftware shop. I'm in it right now and I thought I'd give you a little tour.

So as you can see, I like an eclectic creation of curios, homewares, giftwares, candles, cushions, mats. What else have we got? Oh, jewelry, lots of different pieces there. Yeah, so this is my little business.

Stationery, which if you're anything like me, I'm obsessed with good, pretty stationery. More candles, more books, artworks, and more jewelry, which who can have enough of that.

So yeah, that's my little shop. I've just had so many people ask what I do and what my business is. So when I started in interior design or furniture design, and I think that that was seven years ago, like six months prior to leaving the cult. And you know, it was really scary because financial security is the scariest thing out here. It's the reason a lot of [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=1982s) go back to the brethren. It's a reason a lot of people don't make it when they get out here. And it's the ability to put a roof over your head or food on your table. It's a very real thing because the brethren control everything and everything is so well looked after by the leadership or by those with more money in the brethren. You don't really know, you aren't well-equipped with street smarts or how to save or how to live in the real world. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2012s) it's a very real reality. Like I remember somebody helping me find my first rental. It was so scary.

And venturing out into a small business, it's hard enough at the best of times and with everything we've had in terms of COVID or in where I am, fires and floods. So yeah, this is my little shop. It's called Manor on George, and I'll share the socials or the website. But I've had a lot of you ask what I do and this is what I do. I'm super passionate about it.

Thanks for your support, guys. A lot of you have reached out and said, are you not worried for your safety? Thank you. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2049s) in a great place. I'm not worried for my safety in terms of mental health or physical. I don't know what the brethren could do to me physically. I'm one call away from the police. I'm not afraid to do that.

But I do know, and you know, a few of you have said why it's taken you seven years to come out and speak about it. And this is why it's taken me so long, because all your life you were taught you're better off to die than to leave. It's such a mental mind game to, you know, a mind fuck basically, to come out and speak about it because you're ultimately speaking against everything you ever knew and your family. And whilst you're not against them or bitter against them, it's the environment they're in that they [enable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2097s) and support. So it's not them individually. Like I love my mother and I love my family. I mean, my dad, but I didn't really have a great relationship with him. We'll do another video about what I suffered at the hands of him.

But yeah, it's taken me a while to come out and speak about it because, you know, once you do, you're branded by your family in there and your family have to endure this too. But again, it's not about them. It's not so much about me. I'm more doing this to help raise awareness about the toxicity of this cult. And hopefully some other people that might be in a similar situation might leave. It's only last week I heard another member in there that thought the only alternative was suicide and has committed suicide. So I am very passionate about speaking up about this because I was at that point. I did not know anyone on the outside.

Sorry, I did not know anyone on the outside and I tried to commit suicide because I didn't know any different. I, because of the environment I was in, because I was so sheltered, so protected. And so when you come out and speak up against it, those people, myself now, are branded as opposers, as apostate, which, you know, would have affected me years ago, but now it doesn't. I'm not superstitious at all. And they have little prayer meeting rituals where they pray for your [death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2178s).

Now, I'm getting a lot of comments like this about how come the men look like clones or the women look like cookie-cutter molds. I'll explain why and give you an example of my experience with that. So on Sundays, we had church five times a day. So a 5am service, a 10am, a 3pm, then a 5pm. Wait, that's four times a day. And then every night during the week from Monday to Friday, and then Saturday [morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2208s). So yes, full on, church was full on.

And like I've explained in previous videos, you cannot mingle or associate or be friends with anybody outside of the congregation, the church, the assembly. So it's very restricted and almost like a psychological commune in terms of, it's not a commune, they are seamlessly integrated into society, but it's psychologically a commune. And so there is one leading [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2238s) where the leader is, and that family sort of dictates or is the leaders in terms of fashion, for example, in most things because, you know, they're the royal family.

But in terms of things like fashion, so that's why you know, you'll see most brethren, you know, back in the day they were renowned for their long denim skirts and long hair and, you know, like little tokens like big flowers or fascinators as some people have said. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2269s) styles have sort of changed, like the women have to wear something in their hair as a token for protection from the angels because the angels will look down and go, oh, that's a woman, you know, she's the weakest sex, she needs help. So I used to always question that too because I'm like, well, if I'm wearing a hat, do I get extra protection? And how do the angels tell? Like it's just so superstitious.

And so with the clothing, so you'll notice a lot of them have puffy headbands or that was a trend. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2299s) sort of changes and usually is influenced by the royal family, the Hales family. So the men though all look the same because they want to look like the leader, right? And he is the main influence when it comes to the whole society, the whole world. So yeah, the neat white collared button shirts, you know, buttoned right up to here with black pants and black shoes is, you know, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2329s) look that most of the men have. And they'll definitely have to wear white shirts on a Sunday and other days, other church meetings, it's just usual plain dress shirts. You know, the previous leader didn't like checks, so nobody was allowed to wear checks.

I've had a lot of people ask about the rules and the regulations around being in that cult. So I thought, why not jump on their own website and answer their FAQ page, their Frequently Asked Questions page, with my [own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2360s) experiences, my own personal beliefs, what I experienced and how I perceived the Brethren from an outsider as somebody that's witnessed it firsthand. And, you know, this is the Brethren's response to all these questions, and I'll share you mine. We'll see how they differ.

The first one I just had to like, address immediately because this is ludicrous and an outright lie. So one of their questions is here, “ Are there specific rules that the PBCC, Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, must follow? [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2390s) are no specific rules.”

What? When did this change? There are no specific rules. Yet my mum, as you just saw in the recent video, can't catch up with me for a coffee. I can't go to her house on Mother's Day and drop her off something. She can't come out and speak to me. There are no specific rules. Did this just change yesterday? Because I'm confused.

And then it goes on. “Brethren’s universally maintained beliefs and lifestyle is based on the Holy Scriptures. We are genuine in our endeavours to secure our sustainable structure of family life.” What, by arranged marriage? By enabling alcoholic abusers? That isn't a sustainable, normal structure of family life for the enduring happiness. Oh my God, the lies. I've never read through this. I'm witnessing this firsthand with you. So excuse my emoji reactions, but I just, oh, this is written by the brethren as a whole.

“However diverse in character.” So back, back, back this up. “Family life for the enduring happiness of our members, however diverse in character, capacity, or and cultural diversity.” Although, put the cultural diversity in to try and sound like they are diverse, they are not. They are the most racist, homophobic group I've ever met, ever. And they're not about diversity at all. Well, as a gay man, why am I not welcome?

So bring it all back in. There are specific rules, very strict rules that the brethren must follow with immediate, lasting consequences. This is a lie.

This question is further to another question that was about outsiders working in the brethren businesses. And you've made a comment that you've gotten in trouble for talking too much and they were getting too familiar, which is the term the brethren use because, you know, there's this rule of separation where you aren't allowed to mingle or get too [familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2513s) or close to outsiders due to the Bible verse, 2 Timothy 2, "let him that names the name of the lord withdraw from iniquity." So the brethren are not iniquitous, they withdraw from it. Interesting one that. So all of us here on the outside are iniquitous, living in sin basically, which is pretty cool. I'm okay with that.

But I want to share a story about my experiences with this. So on the inside of that. So I had a work friend [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2543s) I used to work for the leader's son-in-law who used to give me books. Now books were banned in the brethren, particularly at my age at, you know, 23, 24\. So I used to, she used to give me books. I would read them and then give them back to her in a bag secretly at work because I would take them home and read them under my sheets. You know, there's a grown-ass man reading books or in my walk-in wardrobe in the dark of night with a torch because I couldn't leave books around at my house because my dad would chuck them out.

As [soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2573s) as he found them, and he would constantly search my room. And I know because I used to put things in place to figure that out. And also, if I ever had a book or anything that was un-brethren or non-brethren, it would be chucked out. It would mysteriously disappear. There'd be no conversation, just gone. And I'd know. Like if I asked him, he'd be like, I don't know what you're talking about. So I got over the denial that he lives in and just thought, okay, we just won't talk about it. I'll just have to be more secretive.

So I used to borrow these books [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2603s) I'd never take them home. I'd hide them in my car and read them even at lunchtime. I'd drive off and read them. I devoured books because I lived in a reality within books and that was my escapism. But this one time, my manager, a little weird, sorry, I had to get that out, he was a douche to me, an absolute arsehole. He used to monitor everything I did. He pulled me aside and said, what was that bag you gave... [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2633s) won't say her name and she's one of my good friends, but I just don't want to put her out here unless she gives permission. And he said, what was in the bag? And I got taken to the leader's office, my boss's office, and I had to confess that it was a book. What book was it? I think it was like, I don't know, Scarlet Pimpernel or something like that, but huge no-no. I got in trouble, she got in trouble.

So this question says, what percentage of leaders do you think genuinely believe what they're saying? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2664s) how many do you really think are aware of their own lives and tactics? Well, I don't know. I genuinely believe they realize that it's not real. Like it's, I don't know, it's hard. Like because there's the psyche behind, you know, the bigger the lie, the more people that believe it. And particularly the leaders, they know what they're doing. Like they can see because everybody reports back to the leaders, to the leadership. So they would be knowing, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2694s) well aware of all the abuses that are happening in there, all the horrific things that have happened get reported back to them and they cover it up because of the image.

And the brethren are very, very business, money-oriented now, like in particular in the last reign of the last leader, which was never the goal really. I think it's the last couple of leaders that have become very money-focused. So it's become more of a business rather than [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2724s) religion. Obviously, it's always been cult-like and in my opinion, a cult, but just has become more extreme towards later years, like modern times, because you know, it's harder to control members now because you have things like social media. Like back in the day, no one could get on TikTok and explain a horrific life they had here in Australia, in bloody Sydney. Like it's crazy to think that these people operate and are seamlessly [integrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2755s) into our society and, you know, your neighbor could be being abused. And that's so common. And I've had so many people come forward from this and talk to me about their hidden lives amongst the brethren and the abuses they suffered. It's just horrific. Some of the stories are absolutely horrific. Like I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad. And that's why I will not stop speaking up about it.

And the leaders know. So how can you look out and go, well, this is God's chosen [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2785s), as you keep telling them. This isn't God's chosen people. It's an environment that harbors and enables abusers because they can get away with it because you protect them, right? There's no taking it to authorities until, unless somebody else does, then they'll be like, oh yeah, we don't condone this behavior, not at all, no. But you cover every other one up. And this is why I 100% believe with your question that they do know and they're very tactful in maintaining their reputation because it's always church [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2815s), family second. And that's the very reason my own mother doesn't speak to me.

Here, somebody's asked, do they use the traditional Bible of Old Testament, New Testament, or do they have their own version? So yes, they have a Bible which has the Old Testament and the New Testament, but their focus is purely the New Testament where their apostle of choosing is Paul. And so they follow the Pauline line of ministry. And the leader today and the original leader, so there's been [seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2845s) leaders since the beginning or the origin of the cult, which happened, you know, they were founded about 150 years ago. But there's been seven leaders and each leader follows the Paul teachings in the Bible, the apostle Paul. And it's kind of, the leader is kind of the same as, you know, he's called the Paul of our day. So he's the elect vessel, man of God, revered as what he says [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2875s) as good as God.

And yes, it is their own version of the Bible. So the original founder of the Plymouth Brethren or the Exclusive Brethren, his name was John Nelson Darby, JND they referred to him as. And he rewrote the Bible in his own version. Back in the day when, you know, doing that was kind of, you couldn't just borrow the transcripts or the manuscripts, whatever they were. He kind of memorized the Bible, went home and wrote out his own version. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2908s) accuracy could be called to question here. I mean, how many of us have all been at the same party and gone home and recounted the story and not embellished a little where we felt necessary or changed the story? So I have always questioned the accuracy of the Bible. And, you know, the brethren say, oh, he did it with the Spirit of God, he did it with the Word of God, or he did it with God in him or the Spirit.

Well, as you can see by the behaviors of the brethren, there's nothing godly about them at all, particularly the leaders.

Hey there, I have a lot of people ask me in relation to my relationship with my mother. As I've explained in previous videos, I escaped a very strict religious cult that bans family members from speaking to people or family members that leave once they've been excommunicated. So I thought I'd share with you, Mother's Day is particularly hard for me because I miss my mother incredibly, but I always let her know that I still love her and I'm still here and I'm still the same person. I just am not [controlled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=2970s) by the same religion that she's controlled by.

And if you're new here, hi, I'm talking about the Exclusive Brethren, which I escaped seven years ago. And follow my journey as I share with you how strict and insidious this cult is here in Australia. It's worldwide, but the majority is here in Australia. Yes, Sydney. Crazy. That's where the leader is too, by the way, just a fun fact.

So I sent my mum a message as I do every Mother's Day saying, I just want you to know how much I love you and I'll always be here for you. And [yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3001s), she always comes back with the same response. Thank you. That prayer emoji and a hug. And I know some of you would go, well, she responds. But guys, let's be real. This isn't even the bare minimum. And I'm not outing my mom here. I'm sharing with you how strict and how toxic this cult is on people in there because my mom would be suffering from this and people that leave like myself. And also to share with other people that might be in a similar situation, [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3031s) that, you know, to show that I'm seven years out, nothing has changed with me. I'm just unashamedly me. I'm not afraid to be gay, which is one of the main reasons I left because they're extremely homophobic.

And so I've had some of you say, well, why don't you ask her out for a coffee? I've never seen you say, why don't you ask? Okay, I did. And this is what will happen. We haven't, I'll do a part two when she responds, but she'll have to get approval on this response and watch [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3061s) dialect or the language change because it won't be her saying this. So you can see here, I've said, would you let me take you out for a coffee? No reply, no response. So this was yesterday. And she'll come back probably in a day or so with a scripture and as to why she can't. Now, this is not my mom speaking, I know, because she doesn't really know it that well. She wasn't really, she's not really into the religion. She was born into it and her parents were born into it. So it's very, [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3092s), her mom wasn't, but that's another story. But yes, just to show you that I do do everything to try and maintain a relationship with my mom. And, you know, the brethren have this website where they say they encourage. Well, this is not encouraging because my mum is acting not on her own actions, but on that of the church. And I'll come back with part two on how she replies. Stay tuned.

Hey everyone, just a long overdue update on asking my mum or catching up with my mum, when she's stuck in a cult, for coffee and how severe and strict the rules are of separation and the excommunication once you escape the cult and how brutal it is. And I just have given this some time because, A, it's been an emotional journey, and also I'm playing this out in real time, so I want you [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3146s) know I can't, you know, it's real time. There's no control over that. And last I shared was the first message was, would you let me take you out for coffee? So every year, mum's birthday, Mother's Day, I reach out to her. Sorry, it's really hard to talk about. So excuse me if I get a bit emotional.

And it's always the same response as you saw last time. It's just a thank you, which, you know, some might say, well, it's a response. Yes, but it's barely the bare minimum. And I'll explain. So then I reached out to her a bit later, said, hey, mum, just checking you got my invitation for coffee.

And then I explained a few days later the reason I was asking is because I thought maybe the rules around their separation had changed because I had seen my auntie having coffee with an old neighbor, an outsider, who they deem really, you know, sinful. Like, and to which I sent a screenshot of me asking and confronting my auntie because she did it right in front of my shop and came into my shop with her to kind of rub it in my face. And so I reached out to my [auntie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3218s) and said, do you need help? Like sometimes this is a way of them crying out for help. And she said no. And I said, well, I find it strange that you can meet up with your neighbor for a coffee, but you won't meet your nephew. And that was my favorite auntie back then. And she said, oh, I view it very differently, two Christians speaking and walking and talking together. And I'm like, I'm your flesh and blood, I'm your nephew.

And then I'll show you the rest of the message to my mum. So I sent her a final message this [morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3249s), just outlining, as you can read here, "Morning, Mom. I understand you've probably been told not to speak to me again. I understand. Just know as your son, I'll always love you and what I'm doing in raising awareness as to the life I was a part of is to help the many victims that have suffered abuse and are still suffering. I love you and what's to come is nothing against you personally, but in view of a greater good. You always taught me to be honest, kind, and good, and I'm doing just that. I won't say goodbye because my heart is open to you forever. I love you endlessly. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3279s) if you ever wish to escape, know I'm here for you. Your loving son always, Ben."

Sorry, that's just really hard to read because I know my mum has probably been told not to speak to me again because of me speaking out, but I knew it was a cost that would come with helping others.

So just to conclude on the last two videos that I've done about my mum and reaching out to her, the one I did a week ago on Mother's Day and then the follow-up one I did this morning, just to give you all a part two and how it's [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3309s). Whilst they're trapped in the cult, it's multi-generational. So their beliefs are multi-generational. I was fortunate enough to be born gay, so I had that to make me question the teachings of the Exclusive Brethren.

But I think I wanted to touch on a couple of things that I didn't get to in the last video. As you can see, I've reached out to my mum over the seven years. I've been a constant reminder to her that I'm alive. I do exist, and I am your son. And I still love you. I haven't changed. I'm just not ashamed of being gay anymore. That's all that's changed. And I think as hard as it is for me, it's just as hard for my mom and my family because, you know, I was very loved by my mother and my sisters in particular, not so much my dad and my brother. That was another story for another time.

But you know, they've had to scratch my photos out of the photo book. They have these photo books, they've had to erase my name from there like I don't exist. They record dead people in there, but if you leave, you don't get recorded. You aren't acknowledged as a person anymore, as part of that family. And their teachings all your life, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3391s) my life I was taught you're better off to die than to leave this faith, this religion or cult. And so it's very confronting for them and for my mom for me to pop up and say, I love you on Mother's Day or a happy birthday, because I'm a constant reminder that what she is being taught isn't true, because I'm still alive. And I'm happy, healthy, peaceful, successful.

Although they do base their success on their monetary value, which I base my success on my peacefulness or my happiness. And in that, I'm very successful. I have a very happy, peaceful life. I constantly reach out to my mom over the years to remind her that you can have a better life out here because I know that she doesn't have a great one in there. And I just, I think I wanted to wrap up on the last two videos to say that I'll [always](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFs_HyQPe4s&t=3448s) be reaching out to her or always be here for her. I probably won't reach out as much to her as I have because it's too traumatizing, you know, to reach out to somebody and just be left on read.

I, yeah, it's a lot. So I will always be here. Mom, if you ever watch this, for you, I love you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
