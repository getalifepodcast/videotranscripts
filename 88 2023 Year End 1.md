### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=17s)

Hi everyone. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We are here with Lane and Richard to celebrate our year-end for Get-A-Life. We have a ton of guests coming on today to give us an update and have a little short interview. So I would like to, we'll start with Lane first and just what do you, got plans for your holiday season?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=45s)

Well, definitely a big meal, right? Lots of gifts, did a ton of shopping, right? Which is so fun, like not having done Christmas as a kid, right, growing up in the Brethren. It's so fun to go out and like pick different gifts for family and friends and so that's what we're doing. A big party, getting ready for that. I know the food's gonna be amazing. The girlfriend's making some pretty good stuff, I'm not sure what though, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=75s) she always makes amazing food.

So I'm excited about Christmas now, you know, like I'm, it's just a holiday we never got to celebrate and now it's such a fun thing, right? And I'm like, and the irony of it is hilarious because I was laughing about it this morning. The Brethren, you know, very Christian and they love Jesus and yet they don't celebrate his birthday, right? And I'm an atheist [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=106s) the church and I love Christmas, you know, and it's such an amazing time of year.

Everybody's so happy, getting together. You're seeing your family and friends. Like it's an amazing, amazing time of year. So I'm really excited for this podcast today to have people on. I want to hear about other Christmases. I want to hear about people's plans for the new year. Right. And if there's some, you know, some friends that people have, some ex-members, maybe be like, "Hey, so-and-so might be leaving this year," right? Maybe that'll [happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=136s) Maybe 2024 will be the year that some people inside are going to be like, "This is the year I'm getting out of the cult."

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=143s)

Awesome. So what for you yourself personally, what do you hope comes out of all of this within the PBCC?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=151s)

Some justice, right? There has to be justice for the people that have suffered. I just finished Craig Hoyle's book and it was fantastic, but just you can see the injustices over the years, the pain and the suffering. So I think what I want to happen is a bit of a rude awakening, right, for those that have committed crimes inside the PBCC and that are [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=181s) uneducated and primitive that they believe that confessing it to a half-assed so-called priest absolves them of a crime. It doesn't, right? So I hope for justice, justice for the victims of abuse.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=197s)

And do you have any updates since you've done your podcast and stuff? Is there any updates you can give us since yours?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=204s)

There is absolutely nothing I can tell you.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=212s)

And a question we are going to ask everyone today is, do you have any messages for anyone inside?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=221s)

If you're planning on leaving, set 2024 as a goal, right? People have left in shorter time frames than even in a year, right? They've done it in a couple of months. So if 2024 is your year, start making those plans. And if you love Mr. Bruce in there and you're a listener and you hate us, buckle up. That's my message. Oh, and Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and I love most of you. So I'm kidding. Oh, I gotta joke around a bit, right?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=259s)

You got it, we'll go insane if we don't. Richard, first Christmas. No, this isn't. This is her second Christmas. Kiki's second Christmas, isn't it?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=274s)

Just about, yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=275s)

She wouldn't have remembered her first. What are your plans for the holidays?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=281s)

Yeah, we'll probably, well, we'll eat out a bit for sure. We have some family come for Christmas, so that's nice. So things get noisy and a lot of fun. Yeah, we're probably not going a long way. We tend to sit around and listen to Pentatonix Christmas songs or something and generally be lazy. That's about the extent of it. Lots of good food and, yeah, hiking. You know, it's nice when you've eaten too much to go and get out into the wilderness and walk some of it off. So, not terribly exciting, but it's what we love to do.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=331s)

And what are you hoping for? Like we have been, I think this is going to be podcast, is it 88 or 89? Yeah, and that's a lot of podcasts that we've put in. What do you, what do you hope comes out of this or what do you think will come out of this?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=347s)

I think it's actually having a huge effect inside the cult. I think a lot of people, you know, quite a significant percentage of current members are really having their eyes open to the reality of their situation and the reality of what they're connected with. I'm sure they're experiencing what's known as cognitive dissonance, in that they listen to these podcasts and they know that what we're saying is true, and yet at the same time they're still clinging to the idea that the Brethren is this kind of magical God's special people and God's testimony on earth.

And the two ideas, they can't both be true. So, I think [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=402s) lot of people are in a very uncomfortable state of mind where they're still clinging by force of habit and indoctrination to these ideas that Bruce is God's representative. And at the same time, there's this awful dark shadow of suppressed knowledge at the back of their mind that he's really a kind of an elderly furniture salesman with a bad drink habit. And, you know, what's going to win? I mean, the truth [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=440s) going to win through, but it's going to be a painful process.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=443s)

Yeah, I agree.

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=444s)

But the truth will set you free. So it can only go one way. Once you've seen the light, you can't turn it off again. So it's going to be a painful year for people, I'm afraid.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=460s)

Mike, put it this way. Get-A-Life podcast can't be true and Bruce Hales can't be true. You know what I mean? That's the cognitive dissonance that I think these Brethren members inside, or some of them, are having, right? Is we, yeah, we know we're telling the truth, right, and they know it. And then they're like, "Yeah, but he can't also be telling the truth."

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=480s)

Yeah. So, yeah, but Bruce is always right. He's incapable of, he's incapable of sin and of telling a lie. So go figure, Brethren.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=490s)

Yeah, it's gonna create some mental health issues.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=494s)

Do you, can you share any updates, Richard, with your life?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=502s)

I started a new job recently, which is really great. I'm really happy. I'd had kind of six months or so paternity leave in effect, which was also great fun because, you know, I got to spend real quality time with my baby when she was, you know, in that first year of her life, which is something I'd, I suppose, missed out on in the Brethren because Brethren lives are so busy that, you know, while Brethren love their children dearly, they don't get the quality time to spend with them.

So to actually, you know, literally have six months completely off work, just raising the baby, so to speak, that was a really magical experience. And I'm sure there'll be a kind of a bond there between us that they wouldn't have been otherwise. But yeah, I'm back to work. Enjoying it, keeps me young and fit. And yeah, life is, life is very good.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=572s)

And what would your message be for someone inside? Or do you have a message for someone inside?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=582s)

I don't want to name names. I mean, there are people I would love to address by name, but I guess the message is the same to all of you, really, there inside. And, you know, New Year's resolution for 2024, start being honest, at least with yourself, if with no one else, because that will cause the most radical change in your life that will ultimately be for your good and for the good of those around you.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=616s)

Yeah, yeah, very true, very true. Well, I have my kids coming home for Christmas, so I'm really, really excited. It is, I am the worst. I'm just not a very good mom letting her kids fly from the nest. I would prefer just to, you know, have them all in the same town right beside me and, yeah, I don't know, I guess you can call me a helicopter mom. I just like having my kids around. It's just, it's super important to me.

So I am really excited for that. And you know, I always cook a big huge turkey meal for everybody here and we have a blast playing games. I have a bunch of new games we're playing this year, and we've got darts and balloons and us adult kids and we're all just gonna have a blast in the garage this year. And I [guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=669s) my hope for the PBCC is very similar to Lane's. It is justice, it's accountability.

I think Mr. Hales is making this way harder on himself than he needs to. I don't think it needs to crumble the way that it's probably going to crumble. The more he resists is the more pressure he's putting on it all. You know, we have, we've had, you know, people reach out. I mean, we don't get all nice emails, we get some nasty emails. And you know, we had an insider reach out talking about why do we name Bruce and everything instead of other individual names.

And I [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=716s) saying Bruce is responsible for it all. He is the one that everybody responds to, answers to, and he and his minions are the ones that give the rules out. So my true, true pinpointed hope for this is for Mr. Hales to just learn what accountability is and that it's not as bad as what he thinks it is. I too, like Lane, cannot give any updates, which is, that's all, it's all good.

And my message is to my parents, be the truth, tell the truth. That if you truly wanted to be the parents that you've said you've always wanted to be, tell the truth. You will set yourself free. It's not going to be as hard as you think it's going to be. You are going to feel absolutely incredible after you [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=771s) it. But to be able to sit in a very uncomfortable situation with a horrible story, telling the truth even though it feels like you're being dismantled inside, will set you free.

So that is my message, I guess, for everybody in there, is be in the truth, like sit in the truth. And if you don't know what the truth is, sit with yourself enough, listen to your gut. Your gut [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=801s) lies. You'll know the truth. So with that being said, we today are going to just bring on guests one by one and have just a short little conversation with them. And our first guest of today's show is Jill Mytton. Jill, thank you so much for taking this time and coming on.

I know that you have been hard at work at so many different things. You know, really truthfully and honestly, you are the person that was one of the first dominoes in this entire set that went down. And even though it's taken many, many, many years for the rest of us to stand up and come along behind you, you are still very much at the front line. And there's a recliner beside you that I think you need to sit down, put your feet up and relax. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=858s) you can do it from your laptop. Because you've put a lot of time and work into this entire movement that I think sometimes maybe those of our generation forget how this really started. And if you want to understand how this started, go read Jill's thesis, which is all attached into the bottom of this podcast. But first of all, what are your plans over the holidays?

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=886s)

I shall spend Christmas and New Year with my daughter Jane and her family. That's awesome. Which is really, it's going to be quiet, but New Year, we're going up to the north of England and we've rented a cottage up there. So we shall enjoy that. Yes. It'll be good to be with family.

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=907s)

You might even get a white Christmas.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=910s)

We might. We might even get to see the Northern Lights, which is quite a tease at the moment, because there's quite a lot of them up there.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=920s)

Yeah, they've been quite active here in Canada.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=923s)

Very active here in Canada. Yeah, sure.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=925s)

So one of our big questions that we are asking each of our guests is, what changes do you hope to see in the PBCC?

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=935s)

Okay, that's quite a difficult question. It is, isn't it? It is, it feels quite a big question. I mean, if I could wave a magic wand, I would take away all their rules and regulations, particularly the ones relating to separation and the division of families. And I would also take away their tendency to be litigious when they don't need to be. They [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=965s) need to talk with us, because we're not really an enemy, we're just people who care.

And so I think those, and I've just finished reading Craig's book, *Excommunicated*, which I wanted to mention because if you read that book, you can read so much of the social history of his multi-generational family who spent their time in the Brethren, and it is quite an extraordinary piece [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=995s) work, I think. So, that's what I finished the year doing, is reading that book, which is amazing.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1004s)

Yeah, it is. I can second that. I just finished it this morning and it's, it is incredible to see the multi-generational trauma, basically, that their doctrines, that their doctrine has...

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1017s)

I want to write about that this coming year in 2024\. I want to collect people's stories so that we get some sense of what it's like to have that long intergenerational trauma, really, that's going down through several generations. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1035s)

And you have been very busy. What updates do you want to give everybody with what you've been busy about?

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1046s)

Well, I was at the ICSA conference this year in Louisville, which was a very new experience. I experienced American life in a town for probably the first time, really, how different it is to here. So I presented two papers there. One of them was about the research which we've been trying to get underway for some time, which I think is very close to being launched, maybe the end [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1076s) January, dare I say that. Cross our fingers. So I've been working on that quite a lot.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1082s)

The research you're doing is so, so important. Like coming from somebody, like a survivor's point of view with trying to bring justice into this world and into what the PBCC have done for generations and generations, this research is absolutely key because it is the research that gets submitted, it's the research that everybody looks for, the data. And for myself, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1113s) mean, I know that you probably get tired of me bugging you about it, but I'm like, it is, it's just, it is so pivotal. Yeah. So from myself, I really appreciate the time that you have put into this.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1126s)

Yeah, thank you. Well, people often ask me, why do I still do this? You know, I'm in my 80th year, believe it or not. And why am I still doing it? Why aren't I just enjoying the mountains at the moment? And I can't actually answer that question. It's something to do with a deep-seated feeling that things need to change, and you guys are making that change happen as well, and it's just brilliant what you've done this year.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1156s) without being a formal organisation, we have been quite extraordinary about working together and producing something. Everybody who's been on the show, it's, you know, the Brethren tend to think that we are an organisation, and at one point they even thought I was the leader. No, I'm not. I'm just one of the many.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1180s)

I think that's something really powerful there too, is that it, that is that there is no leader. It's just a, it's just a movement of people, like you said, that aren't enemies of them, but just that are hurt by what has happened and want change.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1197s)

That's right, we do. And that we care, right? We care about our families still in there.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1205s)

Yeah. And in a sense, you know, they're still our family. That Brethren family is in a way part of our extended family. We have black relatives in there, but we also have all these other people in there who, I don't know why, but I see them all as part of my family, perhaps because they were in a sense when we were members. It's like a big extended family, isn't it?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1230s)

Yeah. And we have shared experience.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1232s)

Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Like fish and chips in the pub opposite the law courts.

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1241s)

And rather too much wine in my case.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1247s)

And what, do you have any messages for anyone specific inside?

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1252s)

Not anyone specific, I don't think, except I'd like to say to Bruce Hales, would you like to come and talk with us? I would be very happy to do that. And I would have a very reasoned and reasonable conversation with you and try to help you understand how your doctrines and practices are still harming people, you know, and we would like to find some [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1283s) of reconciliation with you.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1286s)

He can bring a security team and everything.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1288s)

Yeah, you said just sniper team.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1291s)

Yeah, you can have it all because none of us, we don't care about that. It is truly, you know, you would think with them calling themselves a mainstream Christian church, right, that the leader of that mainstream Christian church, if there was this many, in their words, disgruntled ex-members, that you would think that that Christianity would extend with compassion and empathy to each and every one of us. And they would actually reach out and be like, "Hey, what can we do to help?" But I mean, I've not received any of that. I'm not sure, I'm pretty [sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1322s) nobody else has.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1322s)

I very much doubt it. And in Craig's book again, you know, you can see it over and over again, their lack of compassion towards him and his family down through the ages, really. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1338s)

So thank you so much, Jill. No, you're very welcome. We appreciate this and appreciate your time. I want you to know that each and every one of us ex-members can look to you as the one that grabbed the first sheaf along with a couple of other ones in your generation and started cutting down this very...

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1358s)

We did it first, and then I can think of a few. It's lovely to see you all. Okay, take care, Jill. Thank you. Have a good Christmas. You too.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1368s)

Merry Christmas.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1369s)

Bye-bye. Hello

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1371s)

Hello.

### [**Jill MYTTON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1372s)

Hello, welcome.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1373s)

Stephane, how are you?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1375s)

I'm good, thanks, and you?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1377s)

We're doing great. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1380s)

Oh, thank you. Thank you, and to you.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1383s)

Are you, got big plans over the holidays?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1386s)

Not really. Not really. Christmas for me tends to be a quiet, a quiet moment. I don't, I really don't like Christmas.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1398s)

I've heard that from some people. Yeah, I'm sorry. I said I've heard that from some people when I was booking and that no, they don't like, and that's okay.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1407s)

Yeah, yeah, no, I don't. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Like, I think for some people it means joy and everything and family and all that, but I think because we're the Brethren, we were not raised with that. I never had it and then I never saw the magic in it, really. So anyway, that's that. So on Christmas Day, I'm off to Monaco with my boyfriend and we're going to see The Phantom of the Opera, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical.

That's awesome. So that's a really, yeah, that's really nice. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1437s) a good trip. We tend to do different things these days. I've really tried in the past to get into the spirit and, you know, like two of my brothers are out and they're doing Christmas with their families and they've got kids and they've gone on to the habit of now doing the Christmas thing, but I just couldn't get around to it myself. I just, I'm quite cynical when it comes to Christmas, frankly. I just think the whole thing is way overrated.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1465s)

Yeah, I have to say that for me, it was like having kids is what got me into the Christmas spirit, was having kids. And yeah, then I just make it about eating and games.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1478s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1480s)

You have been very busy lately.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1482s)

I have, I have. No, no.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1485s)

Do you want to let the viewers and listeners catch them up to date with how busy you've been and like what you've been up to?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1491s)

Oh, well, what do you want? Do you want me to talk about my business? Yeah, okay, cool. Why not? Why not? Well, I've had a really good commission. I've been doing luminous tutus for a cabaret here in the south of France, and they've been traveling already around the world. They've been like several times in France, and then they've been abroad. They've been to Morocco on a couple of occasions. So that's really good.

I'm doing a wedding dress right now for a wedding that's to take place at the beginning of January. And I'm busy giving my classes, my couture classes in the [evening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1521s). So yeah, it's good. It's good because I've only recently moved to my new atelier, so it was a kind of, I've taken a gamble, I've taken a risk, and it seems to be working out. So that's really cool. That's awesome.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1535s)

And how was it after your podcast? Like once your podcast was released, how was that for you after?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1540s)

Oh, that was really cool. Yes, I had some very good returns. I was actually amazed at how many people like contacted me past that, some from the Facebook page, well, the ex-Peebs Facebook page. So some ex-members, and that was nice. But also, I published it on, I posted it on my personal page. And so some of my people that really didn't know my story have made the effort to listen to it because I did [warn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1570s) them.

It's like, I'm, you know, I'm rambling for two hours on this podcast. But some people just listen to it and they make the, you know, it was nice that they came back to me and they say that, "We never knew." You kind of briefly maybe mentioned it once or like, you know, because I don't, it's not something you talk about. And if people don't really ask, apart from those who suddenly realize you've not seen such and such film and you've got to explain, other than that, you know, now [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1601s) past is like long ago in the Peebs. So, you know, I don't, I don't really discuss it. So loads of people have discovered that aspect of me.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1610s)

What changes do you hope to see come out of the PBCC?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1616s)

I don't know. I don't know. Like last time when we had the conversation, it was only in the summer, and when we finished, you know, we had a brief talk and I was saying surely the whole thing is going to implode at any moment. But I'm kind of wondering now if it is going to implode or not. I kind of think yes, but I don't really know how it would happen.

It was really interesting the in the recent podcast all about Aberdeen, and I really, really [enjoyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1646s) them. And I really enjoyed Paul Flowerdew as well, who was explaining the life in the Rentons. And I was like, "Oh, yes, of course." I mean, what happened to the people that left at that time? We just, we were never told that. And I kind of never imagined what their life would have been because some of them didn't leave like I did. I wanted to be out, so I left the Brethren. I had my life.

But some of the people who left at the Aberdeen time, they kind of were still in the wanting to, you know, to go to meetings and have [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1676s) six o'clock on the Sunday and all that. So I felt really sorry for these people that they were kind of pushed out purely on the fact that they didn't follow Big Jim. And then, you know, they had to just kind of reinvent their life after that. It was like, really? And you never talked about that in the Peebs. So that was really nice to see his podcast. I've actually got in touch with him past that to say thank you very much because I really thought that's really, really interesting.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1708s)

Yeah, he's such an incredible person, isn't he?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1712s)

Yeah. And so in it, when you see that, you think, well, if something was to happen, of course, it wouldn't take the same shape and form. I don't think Bruce is going to go and find a nurse and be found in bed with her. Else, we don't know. But I think what's happened in recent years is that the whole thing has turned into such a business that it's no longer even a, you know, a Christian church at all in my [eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1742s). Well, it kind of already wasn't 30 years ago, but it now is even worse than that.

It's completely past that. And I'm like, they are so trapped into a system where their all life and professional life and family life and their mortgages and their everything is in the Peebs now, like their insurances, so their schooling system. So I'm like, if there's a crisis that happens, I kind of like, I'm a little bit worried that some people would, you know, some of my family, but you know, broadly so, some of the Peebs would like find it really difficult to adjust and and figure out what to do because loads of them just are so trapped in the system, they don't question things. So I don't know. I don't know what would happen. Tell me, what's your views?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1798s)

I think they'd all fall for pyramid schemes immediately. Well, they've been one already. So yeah, I think they'd, they like, if the church fell apart tomorrow, let's say, right? Or there was a big split and there was, like you said, there was people that were kind of forced out all mass that didn't want to leave. They still wanted to be part of that. I think if they were forced to try and adjust into society now, it's so fast-paced that they would fall for all the spam and tricks and any [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1836s) of dealing without that protection of the Brethren society that they have. They all do business with each other and stuff now, right? And they protect each other. And yes, they do business with the outside world, but I feel if they were forced split, there would be a lot of just...

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1852s)

Falling apart. I know, I know. I'm like you. I think there would be a lot of damage actually. And I really, which is why sometimes I'm thinking, well, if it happens, what, you know, well, hey, what am I going to do with regards to my family? But what can we do as a group to say, well, to offer some form of support? Because I'm really, I'm serious. So some people will just crumble down because their wall, what they existed, if it crumbles...

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1881s)

What happens? Yeah, cults fall apart. Well, you know what I mean? Like you look at the history of the cult and the dedication gets more and more and more dedicated, more and more dedicated. And yes, people fall away, but it doesn't seem to end well, right? There doesn't seem to be great endings to cults. No, exactly. And that's, that's terrifying, right?

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1904s)

Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, that's the thing is like, I think they're so business-driven these days and the whole thing is so much about money and controlling them through their money that I just don't really, I can't really see how it's going to explode or implode. It'll be interesting when Bruce goes, because is it going to stay in the family? Are they like acting as a dynasty from now on? You know, is it going to be one of the sons or the son-in-law, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1934s) rumor has it, you know? Or is there some American somewhere or some English that's going to say, "No, it's me. I'm the new Elect Vessel." You know, how are they going to fight for the role, for the title?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1948s)

I just want to know how I can bet on it. Yeah. I think they should settle it by hand-to-hand combat. I mean, it provides good entertainment if nothing else. Game of Thrones style.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1961s)

They could make a lot of money off of it, you know, it'd be a whole new business deal.

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=1964s)

But seriously, I mean, what happens with dynasties is that you get a situation when you've got two of the sons and they both think they're the heir. And then the fight starts. And I mean, it's brutal stuff. I mean, you even see it in family businesses, but when it gets to the level you're controlling multi-billion dollar empires, and I mean, the situation in the Peebs is, the oldest son is, you know, apparently totally irresponsible, real loose cannon.

The next one down is more sort of level-headed. So, you know, the older son's going to think it's his by reason of his just being the oldest son. The next one down is going to think, "Well, it's mine because I'm the one with the brains around here and I haven't screwed up so bad." And then there's the son-in-law who's the outsider. So I can see a really interesting three-way fight. And you know, I'd be really happy to sell ammunition to all parties at a good markup. I think it could be a very profitable business.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2021s)

Don't you guys think it's a shame that we couldn't somehow get them to accept a reality TV show, right? Like, would not this make the, it would make billions, billions. It would be the most popular show in the world.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2035s)

Yeah, it would beat up the Kardashians.

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2039s)

Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, isn't that, isn't that exactly what we're doing here? You know, giving some insight into the inside of a blow-by-blow account of the dynasty of the Hales Dynasty Wars.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2058s)

I think they're shaken, actually. And part of it, Cheryl and Lane and Richard, is because of all these podcasts. I think they feel shaken. I don't think they feel secure right now, frankly. I'm pretty sure he's watching us and I'm pretty sure they're watching what's their next step. They're probably planning this. They're probably putting their minds together and figuring out what happens next because you know, like the Palmy party, was it like, you know, why, why did that happen?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2090s)

Yeah, they, well, yeah, they're definitely on, they're trying to win their people over right now. They are. They, I mean, especially just even since the Universal Meetings, we know that, you know, there was a lot of Get-A-Life podcast subjects brought up and they are...

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2108s)

Oh, the recent ones.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2109s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2110s)

Oh, okay. Okay, cool.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2111s)

Aberdeen was a, yeah, a huge topic in them. So we know Bruce Hales is very much, Aberdeen is a thorn in his side. So he's constantly got to be, you know, oiling that machine so that it doesn't break down. And I too, I do. I think it's, I think the biggest breakthrough is going to happen when he goes and someone has to take over. I think that's when that's, that's when the weakness is going to happen. Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

Well, Stephane, [thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2141s) you so much for joining us for just this little short excerpt. We really appreciate, I was so happy when you were able to come on. And like always, whenever you come on, there's a big huge smile on the face, there's laughter, there's, you just spread that joy. So thank you so much and have a great new year.

### [**Stephane VERGNON**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2160s)

Yeah, thank you very much. And all you three have a great new year. Happy, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you. Thank you, Stephane. Okay, bye.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2169s)

Bye-bye. Bye. Hi, welcome, Pam. How are you?

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D2173s)

I'm good. How, how's everybody?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2177s)

Good. We're doing really good. Yeah, we're great.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2179s)

Yeah. You got any big plans for the holidays? Well, I'm in Florida right now, which is, it's beautiful here. I don't know if you can see outside, but yeah, leave. Bruce and I are leaving tonight to fly home to Winnipeg and see the grandkids and have dinners and yeah, it's going to be great. Go to a couple of Christmas parties with friends.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2208s)

Yeah, it's good. Yeah. We haven't seen you. You're one, I think you were podcast number three, so we haven't had an update from you for a long time. How did you find after your podcast, what did you find that it had a good response on your end of things? I know on our end it did.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2225s)

I did. Yeah, yeah. It was, it was good, especially with Andrea too, right? Because she was, I don't think she was, had left by then and she was listening to it. So it was kind of exciting. And then when I found out that she had left, it was even more exciting. But it was good. A lot of friends were like, "Oh, wow, you know, didn't realize you went through all that." But kind of brings everything to the surface. But you know, it was such a [long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2256s) time ago too for me, but it was good. It's been good listening to all the podcasts. I love it.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2262s)

Yeah, getting it out there.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2264s)

Yeah, it makes it, brings things to light, right? And it's changing, changing things, which is amazing. Yeah, they're definitely listening inside there. Yeah. And you three and Carman, man, you guys and others too, I see now more people are joining in helping out in different areas of the world, right? So that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

What changes do you hope comes out of this for the PBCC? [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2294s) just wish they could see the light and to share their... I just wish they could get it. You know, I feel sorry for them. Like, I think, like, what's going to end up happening to them? You know? And they don't see it. Like, how can they not see it, that it's a cult? You know? Yeah. I hope... I think I just hope that they can see the truth for the most part, right?

### [**Richard MARSH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2331s)

Because really they're heading for disaster. I mean, they're getting more and more extreme and at some point the bubble's going to burst for them. And it's going to be very, very messy. And the fact that we're exposing what they're doing, they've either got to kind of double down or back up a bit, turn around, but they seem to be doubling down. But yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't know, you can save the organization, but can you save the people? That's what I'm concerned about.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2370s)

Yeah, as many as possible, right?

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2373s)

Yeah. Like I guess, Lane and all of you, you know, we all look at our families, right, and think, man, wouldn't it be great to be able to see our families, right? But mostly, wouldn't it be fantastic for them to see the light and for them to see the truth? You know, for them to go into, like my parents, like passed away in that. They never, they never saw what it was really, what was really going on. And it's scary that they don't believe it.

You know what, when I said to, I sent a letter to Cheryl, actually. I don't know if Lane told you, but after my podcast, I sent a letter to all of anyone that I could get an email address from Lane, and I sent an email to all of my family and saying like, "I've just, I've just heard from Cheryl Hope and what she's gone through." I said, "[How](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2435s) how can you, how can you be in that religion?" I just don't know exactly how I worded it, but, "How can you be in that religion?" And I said, "You're just as much to blame if you're not doing something about it."

And you know what he said to me? I just could not believe it. He replied, he said, "Do not get involved in this, Pam. If it's true, God is looking [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2465s) it." Right now, I replied, "David," I said, "You say if? Are you kidding me? How dare you say if this is true?" And I never heard back from him. I never heard back from anybody since that day. I couldn't believe it. I said, "How dare you say that? How dare you say that?"

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2487s)

I think that's the hard part in every story that has come forward, right? That again, I go back to this whole thing about them being a mainstream Christian church. Like to me, when I think about a true Christian, to me, the whole Christianity is all about compassion. It's about love. It's about acceptance. It's about sitting down, having heart-to-heart conversations. And not, like none of these survivors have had these heart-to-heart conversations with anybody.

[Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2517s) it's just, it is definitely, I think, not only myself, but many other survivors go through is where you have, it is a kick in the gut. It is a kick in the gut. But at the same time, I'm grateful I am the age I am now, and I'm grateful that I'm grateful for the therapy that I have now because it teaches you really how to allow the truth to unravel the way it needs to unravel.

But the little girl in us, the little kids in us, the ones of the pieces inside us that had to endure what we endured, that's the part that catches up to you at 2 a.m. and on those days when you're tired and you're sick and everything kind of comes at you. So it is, it's hard to hear what their responses are inside there when they call themselves Christians. And, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2569s) I do know we've got such a tight-knit family out here that the support amongst the survivors has been absolutely incredible. And I think each and every one of us takes comfort in that.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2580s)

Yeah, yeah. Well, that's amazing. And that's good that you have that. Yeah, you know. Yeah. And all of these podcasts are just like, you know, first I thought, "Oh, nothing will ever change." Oh, it, it changes, you know? And that, that land, where's that? In New York or...

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2602s)

In Chicago.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2603s)

Chicago. I thought, wow, the power of the power of people, information, right? The truth coming out. The truth coming out. Wow, the power of that is amazing. So good on all of you guys for starting this. Proud of you.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2619s)

Well, thank you. Thank you for coming on on like our third episode.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2624s)

Yeah, I know. That was a long time ago, right?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2626s)

It's wild how far like you've come. Like it's crazy.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2630s)

Yeah, it's great. So would you have a message for anyone inside or to the PBCC specifically? Well, to the PBCC, please think about these things. Get some information and don't be so blind. Please don't be so blind and sucked in because it's not true what's going on. What you're supporting, what you're listening to every day is not true. So find the truth. Yeah. And to anyone leaving, you can do it. Look at us. We did it and we're okay, right?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2672s)

Yes, we are thriving, not just surviving.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2674s)

Not just surviving. We are doing really well. Thinking, you know, Richard, what you went through and having to hide and Cheryl and Lane and like everybody, like we, you can do it. Yeah, reach out. Absolutely. I love that.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2690s)

Yeah. Well, thank you so much. Merry Christmas to everybody.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D2694s)

Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Pam.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2697s)

Happy New Year. Okay, take care.

### [**Pam ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2699s)

Yeah, love you too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2702s)

Yeah, bye-bye. And we're back with Ben and Craig who have been added to our panel, and then we'll bring on some more guests. Welcome, Ben, and welcome, Craig. I really wanted you both on our panel as you've both been really into the public's eye lately and very busy with this whole movement. So we'll start with you, Ben, and maybe you can just give the viewers and listeners an update with what's gone on in your life in the last little bit since [we've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2733s) seen you.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2733s)

Where do I start? I didn't, I didn't expect to have so much response publicly, I guess. You know, I've always said this, that I thought that I would one day share the other people's stories, the people that I helped leave, not my own, because I didn't really think it was that interesting until, you know, last April, started sharing my seventh-year anniversary of leaving the cult. And I started sharing my experiences and it got so much traction. I literally had to get up an hour [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2763s) just to do videos every morning.

So I've kind of stepped back from that a little bit just because business and work life, which will always come first, has been quite hectic. But yeah, it's been quite a journey and a great, it's very cathartic too. It's unlocked a lot of memories, which, you know, it can be a lot to sit with and process, but that's okay because that's all in view of growth, right? It's been, it's been really interesting. I've had so many journalists, people that are stuck in there reach [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2794s), people that have gone through similar situations with other cults or high-demand religious groups.

I've met so many different new people. Yeah, it's just been really, really, and overall, I guess it's kind of restored my faith in humanity, I guess you could say, is generally the general consensus. And I haven't had any negative feedback, only from within the Brethren. So I mean, it means I'm doing something right. So it's just been a really interesting journey as well as quite therapeutic.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2824s)

And I'll touch a link to Ben's most recent compilation of his TikTok videos that was picked up by a group called Happiest, and it went absolute viral. I think it's, what is it sitting at, 1.6 million views? And yes, yeah, it's a, it's a very, very incredible video that she put together.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2847s)

Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't expecting that. Like, I had done like three, out of the 70, 80 videos I've done on TikTok, there was like three of them that had like, hit the 1 million view mark. I think actually the one of the most viral was 2.4 million. So I worked out the other day that that is like 60, 40 times the amount of followers Bruce Hales has. Not that that means anything. I mean, I'm not... Well, it does. That's amazing though. That's amazing.

It's interesting to think that, I don't know, really puts into perspective how small that group is and how, I guess, even more insular their thought processes and then, you know, as we all know, because we've all experienced it. No, it's been really good and it's brought a lot of us together. You know, we'll all feel it, like working on the same front line, I guess you could say, in various parts of the globe, and it's really brought us all together to stand up [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2904s) what is a very toxic group.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2910s)

What changes do you hope to see come out of this PBCC movement that we've all been a part of?

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2918s)

The changes, I think we are seeing. Like, obviously, we all want change now and want it to be expedited, but we're all human and the reality is that everything does take time. You know, you think about ourselves, you know, it's taken me seven years to speak up about it. There's a lot to learn, there's a lot to happen in order for somebody to leave. And yes, we might all want them to all leave tomorrow and the whole cult to be debunked, but that's not a reality and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2948s) very unrealistic and unfair, I guess, on the members because we wouldn't be able to cope with it.

Like, I think it's the 15, 16 people that I've helped leave, it's quite draining. It's quite, it's quite a lot you have to give. And we want to be able to do it properly. We want to have a safe landing place for these people. And I think we're managing to cope with that as it's happening. I don't think a major influx of them leaving would is ideal. So I think the changes I'd like to see is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=2978s) the awareness, that people are aware that we're here. We're here to support them on their time. You know, take your time leaving. It's not an easy choice and you want to make sure it's the right one for you because there are some people, like I can't see leaving.

You know, there are some people that it suits their way of life. It does, it does support and champion a straight white male. Like, it is an ideal situation for them. So yeah, take your time with it. That's the change I want to see, awareness. And I, you know, one of the points that the leader, Bruce Hales, said to me was that there are more people that have overcome your homosexuality than have left. And I want to see that change. I want to see that my community, there is a safe place for you out here to be yourself, authentically yourself. And whether that's male or female, the gay community, I want them to know that there is a safe place out here. You don't have to stay in a toxic, homophobic environment that you are in.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3037s)

That's, it's incredible how many people that you've helped. You know, I think one thing I was surprised by is just how many ex-members actually help other people leave, right? It's just such a common thing to want to help other people escape. That's amazing.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3056s)

It's constant. Like I do hear, like obviously I hear a lot of rumors about me from in there from the people that I still talk to in there. And like recently, randomly, apparently I was being paid by another outsider who apparently has a lot of money, you know, $25,000 or $15,000 for every person I help escape. I'm like, "Okay, well, where is it?" You know, I'll give you my bank details. I'm still waiting.

And you know, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3086s) it's just really refreshing to hear that, you know, that a lot of young kids that I've spoken to recently that want help leaving, they're like, "Oh my God, we, you know, we thought you were an old, bitter, apostate man, not a 32-year-old guy." Like, we found you on Instagram, was like, "Oh, wait, is this the same person?" So I think, I think it's really interesting when they start to rewrite the narrative that they have in their head that, yeah, they put around about you versus reality. We're just normal people, but we also have a backbone and we're just standing up to what, you know, what is a toxic community [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3116s) order to help people, you know, leave. That's it. There's no other ulterior motive, no money, unfortunately.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3123s)

I think it's, that's really a good point to make is that having all these people come on the podcast, it does help rewrite the narrative that has been said in there. And that's happened just recently on some podcasts where I had an insider messaged me about what he had heard and to stay away from a certain person, which was completely false, false information. I had the legal documents, and what was just a simple misdemeanor against [UBT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3153s) was written as a narrative and there is this complete and utter horrible sexual predator.

So I guess to the insiders is that a lot of what you were told about the ex-members and opposers is completely false. So listen, when you do listen to these podcasts, listen and allow yourself to really hear the truth that's coming out of the horse's mouth. Ben, what kind of, what message do you have for anybody inside?

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3181s)

I had this like whole big thing in my head that I was going to say to Bruce Hales, but then I'm like, "No, I'm not giving him the day or time." You know what? This message is for my community, for anybody in there that is closeted or struggling with their sexuality. I hear you, and I'm sure Craig, you can speak the same, we feel you. We've been there. And after hearing about suicides that happened this year, there is another way.

And it's a lot more peaceful and [safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3211s). You don't have to be somebody else. You know, that you can be your authentic self out here. You can find family that loves you just as you are. You don't have to change for, and a network of friends that will champion you, you know, support you all the way. So I guess that is my message. I was in such a state of despair and a dark, lonely place when I was in there, and I did not know of the outside world or anybody that was able to ever support or even just a friendly word [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3241s) or there.

So there is a whole community, a safe landing pad for you out here that is willing and happy to support you because already it's a difficult thing to leave, let alone having to face your sexuality on top of that. So that's my message. Don't, you know, at one point, suicide to me was a positive alternative. Now it's, I couldn't even think far from it. I don't, I sometimes look back and think that that's a story somebody told me about myself. That's how far different your life could be to where you are now. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3271s) yes, it's been seven years, but hey, the time is going to pass anyway. So why not make it worth your while? Why not live that life that you only get one opportunity for and live it fully, live it authentically, but live it fully.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3283s)

Such a good message. And Craig, you've had a very, very busy year and more so since your book came out. Do you want to share the updates that you've been through lately?

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3297s)

It's hard to know where to start, Cheryl. So yes, my book came out, *Excommunicated*, in November. And thank you. There's been a lot of attention around that. It's been covered by all of the major media outlets in New Zealand, and there's been a lot of talk about it on social media. And an interesting, that's been selling out at the bookshops in Invercargill where I grew up, which I thought [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3327s) funny. And there's been such demand for it at the Invercargill library that they've moved it to the trending section.

So I think there's a lot of interest from people down there. And the thing that I find interesting is that a lot of people on the inside seem to be reading the book as well. And feedback is coming through from different places. And what Ben was saying about the narrative that's told about us, you know, I would say to anyone who's still in there, like I have no doubt that I have, well, I know that I've been painted as a terrible person for 14 years now. And no doubt this book will be painted as something wicked and evil. But to anyone who's wondering, I would say just pick up a copy, go and get it from the library, go and get it at the bookshop and [read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3380s) it and make up your own mind. There's absolutely nothing wrong with asking questions.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3385s)

Yeah. And what, like what hope, like what do you hope to see change from, let's just go straight to your book because that book, like from what I've heard, I haven't got the copy of it yet. I'm super excited to read it. I know Lane just finished his this morning. And I mean, stay tuned to everyone in the new year when we have a whole podcast dedicated to Craig and his book. But what change do you hope this book brings?

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3412s)

So one of the messages that I was really clear about putting through with this book is that the harm that is being caused by the Brethren, by the PBCC, has been going on for such a long time. This wasn't just me, this was also my parents, my grandparents, my great-great-grandparents. Going all the way back to the 1840s is the earliest we know of anyone in my family being impacted by Brethren doctrine in terms of pushing and calling family situations.

And so [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3443s) is something that has been going on for 200 years. And there's, it's not just our individual trauma, it's the intergenerational trauma that we're all living with that's just sort of layers upon layers of harm that's been caused. And so I hope that this book serves to teach people about Brethren and who they are, and also really demonstrate some of the, what are in my view of falsehood being put around. One of the things that Brethren are often saying now in their press [statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3473s) is that they're a mainstream Christian church.

And from where I sit, nothing could be further from the truth. And so I think attention to that and really getting home the message to the public about who they are. And the other thing here in New Zealand that we're really looking out for is the Royal Commission, which has been investigating the Brethren for a couple of years now, is set to release its findings in March. So we're keeping a close eye on that.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3497s)

Yeah, perfect. Perfect.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3499s)

Yeah, I finished the book. It's incredible. We're going to do a podcast and speak about it in depth. But I really want to encourage everyone listening to pick up a copy and read that because the history is incredible, to see just the pain and suffering that the doctrine of separation has caused for, like you said, 200 years.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3520s)

And on that note, I just want to say, Craig, I got an email back from your publisher. So to anyone in Australia that's listening, I will be stocking Craig's book in my shop.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3530s)

Love it. It's amazing.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3533s)

And if you can't afford it, I'll ship it out to you as a Christmas gift just to get it out there.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3541s)

Oh, that's awesome. And yeah, same thing in New Zealand. I do have a stack of all the copies and stuff. If anyone does want to discreetly get a copy without going via a bookshop or the library, I'm more than happy to arrange that and have already done that for a few people.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3559s)

Perfect. And do you guys, do Ben, do you have any plans for the holidays or Craig, do you guys have plans for the holidays?

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3565s)

I am finishing up at the end of this week and then we're heading up north. My partner's family have got a beach house up in Northland, just across from the beach. And so there'll be a lot of swimming and a lot of, I'll be reading some books. And then we're going camping for New Year's. I just want to switch off and not think about the Brethren for a while.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3588s)

Yes, it is so important to do that, isn't it? Yeah, because it can, it can consume us. It really can consume us.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3595s)

Yeah, I don't really have any plans to do absolutely nothing, which I enjoy. Well, I don't actually enjoy doing that. I can't seem to switch off. But I'll be spending it with my cousins, just doing what we do, you know, enjoy life, enjoy each other's company. Just, you know, really simple. There's nothing major exciting at holiday like trips planned or anything this year, just enjoying being present with people we love.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3619s)

Well, I appreciate you guys coming on the panel with us today. And with that, we'll bring in our next guest. So our next guest is Lynette from Chicago, and everybody is going to be familiar with her face from the Chicago meeting room hall fiasco that went on. So welcome. How are you?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3644s)

Doing great. How's everyone?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3646s)

Good. Do you have plans for Christmas and the holidays?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3650s)

I got my tree. Christmas, we usually just have Christmas Eve and we eat breakfast for dinner.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3660s)

Yummy.

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3661s)

So it's like waffles and hash browns and it's everything. It's just a fun spread. And then we have Secret Santa. So we don't, everybody comes home and we don't do a big, I'm not material. I don't like all that stuff. So it's just, it's just like two gifts each and not even that expensive each one. And then we just, I don't know, it's just, it's just getting together and [enjoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3691s) enjoying being together for a little bit. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3695s)

Love your tree, by the way.

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3697s)

Thank you. It's great. It's really plain this year in honor of, it's blue because, a little side story, Dan's mom passed away Christmas morning of 2022\. And she, for some reason, she always got away with it, but she would have a little tiny string of blue lights every Christmas that she would put on the mantle of their fireplace. Ah, so this year we're honoring her with blue.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3726s)

Nice. I love it. I love it. So do you, how's your life been post all the Chicago podcast stuff?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3734s)

It's good. I'm still keeping very much on the pulse there in South Barrington. There's like a, well, they have a group where you can write in and keep things up to date. And the park district has, it's this Friday, every Friday they answer questions that the community will pose. So that's been helpful for everyone to see what's actually really going on, if they're being truthful. I mean, I think they are this time. They're being way more, because the Brethren still plan to, they're also going to try again when the land goes back up for auction in February.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3777s)

They are doing some changes with the, the sale of it this time where whoever buys it actually has to pay tax. They're suggesting that they have to pay taxes though, right?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3785s)

They're hoping, they're hoping that they can do that. So I don't know how that's actually going to work because a church doesn't pay taxes. So that's maybe their way of pushing out the PBCC in a nice way. I don't know.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3799s)

Yeah.

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3800s)

So every Friday there's a new, until, until this, until February, every Friday there's a new list of questions that they answer that the community is sending in. So we'll see.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3814s)

Yeah. I mean, just thinking on that right there, that's an interesting way to approach communities about municipalities that might have the PBCC wanting to buy up land, right? It's be like, "Well, why don't put a motion forward that's, do we want this property to be sold to a place that pays taxes or do we not care about taxes?" Right? And most government bodies are probably going to go, "Yeah, I guess we do want a tax-paying business there or a tax-paying something, right?"

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3842s)

Yeah, that's what the whole thing has been. That's what the community is so angry about is the reason that this land is being sold is because they need the money. Even though the Brethren are using the PBCC, they're fighting back and saying it was like freedom of religion, attacking on that. And it's not that at all. It's literally, "We need to get the most we can out of this land and having a church on it, we're gonna get nothing." And there'll be no, like they're so self-inclusive, they're not even going to be out in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3872s) community. And so no...

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3874s)

What changes do you hope to see come out of this PBCC movement?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3883s)

I would like for them to take some responsibility, honestly. But or at least if not responsibility, at least like some acceptance instead of just always pushing, pushing it away and telling the Brethren a different thing instead of what's actually really happening. Like the propaganda part of it is just, I wish that would, whatever keeps them going is the rhetoric over and over, the same thing so that they believe what they're being told because they don't know anything else, I think.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3918s)

Yeah.

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3919s)

So that's why this is good, right? This Get-A-Life podcast, the ones that are, the ones that are listening to it are the ones that are probably more confused because they have both sides coming in now and they have to, they have a choice. They have a, they have a responsibility to make a choice, do the right thing.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3938s)

Yeah. And do you have any message for anyone inside?

### [**Lynette DIENER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3943s)

A message for anyone inside? Well, or them in general. Yeah. Well, I mean, sister-in-laws, brother-in-laws, aunts and uncles, my goodness, I could go on and on. I just, just reply to my text, really, I guess. For my one uncle in Maple Creek who ignores me, like, just reply to me. Like, I'm not scary, you know? And you know who you are.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3965s)

What Lynette is referring to here is the way she's been ignored by her uncle, Don Bowyer. She's asked more than once for a copy of her grandfather's will. Yeah. Well, thank you, my dear. Yeah, thanks for coming on and updating us. And we will see you again. Much love to you. Bye. Merry Christmas.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3985s)

Merry Christmas.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3987s)

Hello. Welcome, Lindy, to the show. How are you doing?

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=3991s)

Great. I'm doing really good, thanks. I've just got off a Zoom with a bunch of people working towards planning for a de-cult conference in New Zealand that another woman is running called Anke Richter. So I'm really excited for that. There's lots of positive things happening out there. It's an incredible kind of time of society. There's so much awareness about these groups and the impact of them, and there's just increasing opportunities available for former members to help them with their recovery and [transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4022s) out and all that sort of thing.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4023s)

Yeah, yeah. Do you want to give the listeners and viewers an update from when we've seen you last? Give an update with Olive Leaf and pretty much where you're sitting right now.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4035s)

Well, I'm sitting on a lime green couch, of course. But no, yeah, Olive Leaf is, yeah, where, what, we, you know, nine or ten months into launching. So not, not, you know, we're still really, really fledgling and we're still establishing lots of the things that we do hope to be able to offer going forward. But I mean, I looked at some of our what we've done over the last few months and I was amazed. Like, we've been contacted, you know, between eight and ten times a week by different people [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4065s) ever since we've launched.

Obviously, a huge number of them are connected with the Brethren, but there's also people from other high-demand groups trying to leave, and as well people offering support. But I mean, I think that's an amazing amount of contact to...

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4081s)

Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4081s)

I mean, I think it is within the, the wider scene is that in New Zealand, there's nothing for, there's no other established entities for supporting people leaving high-demand groups. Whereas in, I know in America and in England and that kind of thing, there's, there's been entities like that around for decades. So in many ways, it's like a new sort of field here that in New Zealand that there's only just beginning to get a greater level of awareness now. So yeah, that we're looking, I'm excited for next year because we're hoping to be able to [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4112s) offer recovery weekends for former members with therapists and more like peer support groups and, yeah, as well as training for therapists and things like that. So it's exciting.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4123s)

That's incredible. And it's so needed. It's so needed. What, what changes do you hope to see come out of this movement within the PBCC?

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4135s)

Oh, yeah. There's a few things. I've been, I've been cracking up lately because I'm on a couple of ex-JW forums, and I've been amazed at like, I'd always heard over the years that there's similarities with the JWs, but I've never really had to do with any. And I've had to do with some more lately and joined a couple of these forums. And it's so funny because it's just like, it's so similar to the Brethren. Like, even the other day, there was a big blow-up because someone had said, "Oh, you'll need to stop being so angry and move on." And everyone was like, you know, just exactly like [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4165s) happens on the ex-Brethren sites of going like, "How dare you? How dare you? We're allowed to be angry. It's, you know, it's injustice," and all that.

And I was like, "I've seen all this before." But the funny thing is, is that the JW leadership forever has forbidden facial hair for men. And they have suddenly done an about-turn and just done this announcement from the top. The Lord has, you know, turned a corner. That's not their language. But basically, they've said they've got new light, that facial hair is now allowed for men. And there have been people excommunicated over this and all sorts of issues. So the ex-member world is blowing up. And, and you know, and rightly so. And so I'm going, "PBCC, let's bring on a change in the facial hair policy for men and for [women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4212s) for next year. Let's, come on, Bruce, bring it on. Bring about a change in facial hair. Let's, let's see that change."

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4217s)

Like, and what about women? Like, how about pants? Start with pants too. I want to see pants for women because that's ridiculous. Like, that is so old school in the PBCC. Shorts for the guys.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4232s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4235s)

Just shorts for the guys, that would be amazing. Yeah, I always was so frustrated that you couldn't, you know, you can't climb a fence in a skirt. There's so many things you can't do. It's ridiculous. The second one that I'd like, that I don't think this would be a good thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if they brought in no contraception. Again, it's been a rule in the past and then it's sort of, but I've been thinking about it and I reckon they're going to be worried about all the people leaving because that's like, that's a key part of their market base and where they're getting their money from is from their own people.

And with increasing numbers of people leaving, they're going to be a bit worried and trying to figure out how to increase their membership. And because they don't really recruit, I think they're going to bring in a no contraception thing to try and get people to breed a bit more. So that's a change I think we might see.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4287s)

I thought that was already in.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4289s)

Well, some people do it behind the, some people do it, but nobody knows about it, right? Like, I'm sure if they were found out, it would not be a very good thing.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4296s)

I distinctly remember my priest going, "No, you don't use condoms. That's stopping a life." Like, it's...

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4301s)

Right, right. Yeah. I think they've loosened off on it though. We're like, you know, there's hardly any families who have got over six kids these days, whereas, you know, the younger ones anyway. So I think they'll be bringing it in saying, "Come on, you guys need to be, you know, popping out a kid a year every year for 10 years," and that sort of thing.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4319s)

Because back in that, back in the 70s, then how does that fall into the narrative? Sorry. I was gonna say, back in the 70s, if you hadn't had children for a couple of years, the priest was around on your door wanting to know why.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4331s)

What was going on? Yeah, yeah. I think they might, yeah, I reckon they might bring back some of that. But you know, that's just, that's just a theory I've got.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4341s)

I feel like while Bruce is alive, they weren't, like it was his ruling that three were, you know, optimum. And I guess, how does that line up with their narrative of like, there won't be any kids or children born as we like get closer to the rapture, like two years before the rapture?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4357s)

Well, maybe the contraceptives thing will be handed out.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4359s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4360s)

Yeah, yeah. Well, that will be interesting to see. Yeah, that is a really strange belief, hey, that one.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4368s)

Yeah. I'm starting to see another option for betting and gambling here. I mean, you know, we can, yeah, we talked about...

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4375s)

We have another business side deal that we're going to start betting on things.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4380s)

Sports gambling on the PBCC.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4382s)

It will be interesting to see what other, yeah, business initiatives they they come up with. Yeah. No, what's another change? Yeah, no, in all seriousness, I do hope that what I would love to see, of course, is a change from the top in the doctrine of separation. They've done such massive about-turns on so many other significant things like technology. We also hear all the time that they're eating with people for business.

[You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4412s) know, those are massive changes theologically and socially. And so I'm hoping that, you know, hey, why don't they bring about that change formally from the top and loosen up on separation? They're trying really hard to say they're just a mainstream Christian church. They're wanting to get away from the extreme label. Well, the separation thing is their most extreme practice. So really, if they want to get away from that, that's the first one that they need to ditch.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4439s)

Yeah, I agree. And greater awareness for members to know what the official leaders have actually agreed to. Because so often we're seeing the leaders are agreeing for one thing on paper, and then none of the members have any idea that it's happened.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4452s)

Yeah, interesting. Yeah. Can you give an example there, Craig?

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4458s)

Like for instance, the Faith and Practice document. Yes, that was agreed to in the UK, which says that the PBCC will provide all practical and financial support to people who leave the community. But the reality is, we're just not seeing that with people who leave.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4476s)

Yeah, and I can attest to that, Craig, because when that came out, I was on somewhat email terms with my father, and I asked him in an email, I said, "Have you seen, do you know about this document?" And I named the document that came out of the UK Charity Commission. And he said no. And I said, "Okay, here you go." And I said, "By the way, check out paragraph whatever on there on your apparent doctrine of non-separation, right? That [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4506s) complete bullshit that you don't even know about."

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4508s)

And it is, it is available in PDF form. I believe it's a PDF form that, so if anybody is looking for the copy of it to send to their parents or send to their aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, whoever it is, it's always attached at the end of all of our podcast descriptions in every single one. Same as the Olive Leaf Network is in every single one. If We Walk in the Light is in every single one. Make use of those documents and those you can send in an email and they'd be able to open them up.

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4537s)

Yeah, that's good.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4541s)

Yeah. Lindy, do you have a message for anybody inside?

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4543s)

I mean, just take the, take the first step, I think, you know. And also, like, live with integrity. Live, you know, if you don't believe in something, stop, stop acting like you do. And just don't, don't be afraid as well. Like, don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to speak what's on your mind. Don't be afraid to live out how you believe and just see what happens. They've got much less power than you think they have.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4568s)

Yeah, I agree. I agree.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4571s)

It's all up here. Yeah, literally all in your head.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4575s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd love to sit and just keep on chatting with you for like another hour, but...

### [**Lindy JACOMB**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4581s)

I know you've got lots of people to talk to. We do. I think the other, I've got a couple more changes I'd like to see that I'll just quickly say. Yeah, I'd really love Streamline to unblock Olive Leaf Network from all their devices. I still can't believe they do that. And that's just insane. So I'd love to see that change happen. And I'd also love to see the RRT. I've noticed that they keep jumping on all sorts of public events that they don't actually doctrinally agree with. Like, they're at, you know, [Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4611s) events and they're at fun runs that they're not actually allowed to participate in. So I'm like, why don't they also come along to Mardi Gras and Ramadan festivals and things like that? I'd really like to see them be a bit more inclusive in their policies of who they support.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4627s)

Such good changes. I love it. We'll see if our requests get answered. Thanks so much, Lindy. Merry Christmas.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4635s)

Thanks, Lindy. Merry Christmas.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4636s)

Take care. See you. Bye. Hello. Welcome, Tom. How are you?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4643s)

Very well, thank you. Very well.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4644s)

That's awesome. How have things been since your podcast?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4649s)

Oh, really good. I was quite surprised by the number of people who contacted me, both people who are ex-Exclusives and also just friends that I've known for, you know, in some cases, decades that really had no idea because it's not something that I talk about very much. Well, some people think I talk about it too much, but that's another story, isn't it? But, yeah, people that I've known [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4679s) a long time, like, "Wow, we had no idea about all that."

And so that was interesting just to talk about what, you know, the changes in my life since I left and so on. And interesting from the point of view of the ex-Brethren who contacted me, depending entirely on their persuasion, they were quite sure that either I was still a deeply committed Christian or had abandoned that. Because as you know, I was cautious not to say very much about any of that because I keep those sort of, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4709s) my personal beliefs are, to myself as a rule unless I'm asked.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4713s)

Yeah. I have a list of people here that would love to be, we'd all love to be adopted by you. So our generation, there's just a long, long list and we just want to come and just sit on the couch and snuggle.

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4724s)

Yeah, okay. That sounds good.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4727s)

So whenever you're ready, you know, I could have adoption papers done up and a lot of us out here that don't have parents would love to have you as a dad.

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4735s)

Oh, that's lovely. Thank you. Yeah, look, you know, I just think I've had the luckiest life, really, you know? And just to be able to look back and sort of see what an alternative universe would have been if my parents hadn't decided to leave, you know, because I, as I said in the podcast, I had no inkling or intention that we were going to leave when we did. And, but it's turned out to be the best thing out.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4763s)

Yeah, yeah. So Tom, out of all of this, what changes do you hope to see in the PBCC?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4770s)

Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? I really think that we are at a moment in the sort of development of technology that's going to make an inroad. And I think we're already seeing that. For example, this podcast, you know, and the fact that I think, as we said and others have said numerous times, people can just go and buy a very cheap phone, get connected to the internet, and find out what's going on. Because you know, when we were kids, there was nothing like that. You know, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4800s) was all, you had to go to the library and find a book. But now you can Google and get onto Facebook and various other things to find out what the world thinks about you, and you might be quite surprised.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4814s)

And one of the other questions that we're asking everyone coming on today is like, do you have any messages for any insiders or just the PBCC themselves?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4826s)

Yeah, well, I suppose the biggest, the most important single point there is that when we think that we have a privileged position and we know the truth and we know exactly how the world should behave, if I look back on my life over a period of, well, as I said, I've turned 70, I think at every stage in my life, I've always [thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4856s) that I was right. Do you know what I mean? We always have that sort of opinion that we have it sorted out, we know what we're doing.

But to be frank about it, if I was to meet myself when I was 20 now, I would think, you know, "You were just very misguided. What you were thinking was wrong and not informed by any form of educational research or evidence." And so I suppose the message that I would say, the biggest single message is, don't just [believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4887s) everything that you're told. Go out and find out for yourself. Work out for yourself what other people in the world who have been working for decades in, for example, in the area of theology.

You know, for me, it was a complete revelation to find out that there are people who've dedicated lives to the study of, you know, Hebrew and Greek and so on and have a very, very different understanding of the translation of the Bible to what Darby finished up with, that really has, I think, led the Brethren astray. So, you know, that's one aspect alone. And quite apart from all other types of things like science, you know, the science of climate change, for example. You know, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4931s) interesting to me that even in the ex-Brethren community, I think there's quite a bit of skepticism about that, which, you know, puzzles me.

Because I don't know if you're familiar with the name Dr. Trevor McDougall, but he was a, he's a Brethren lad who's my age, left about the same time as we did, and he's now a well-renowned scientist. Last year won the Australian Prime [Minister's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4962s) Science Prize, which was worth a quarter of a million dollars, so it's a very sort of exceptional prize, who has researched deep ocean currents for decades. And you know, these sort of things that he would, if he'd stayed in the Brethren, he would never have even been exposed to anything like that.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4981s)

Yeah.

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=4981s)

So the fact that he had the guts to sort of walk out at the age of, I think, 21 or 22 and went to Cambridge and did a PhD and became the world-renowned scientist that he is now is really something that would have been completely missed if he'd stayed. So the message for me is, go and have a look, find out that you're really up a backwater. You're not in the mainstream, you're in a backwater.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5007s)

Yeah. And you, and to find your full potential in all aspects of your life is not going to be found in there, right? Is you've got to, you've got to leave that in order to find your full potential. And I mean that within your faith too, because you're not going to find out what your faith is inside there.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5024s)

No. No, I was going to say on that note that you've said, Tom, is that, you know, you're often, we're told in the Brethren that you don't need to go to Fool's Hill. Like, I remember Bruce Hales saying that in preaching, "You don't need to go to Fool's Hill to find out about the world. We know about it. Take our word for it." And my question to that is to yourself is, "Okay, but then how is your faith, your religion, say you want to keep that religion, well, that faith, how is that genuine? How is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5055s) an authentic link with your creator if it's based on somebody else's judgment, based on somebody else's rhetoric?" It's not, it's not your experience. It's not, and that's what you're encouraged to do, right? You're encouraged to develop your link with your creator. Then how, how is that authentic?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5072s)

Yeah, no, he's exactly right. And if you ask anyone in the Brethren, you know, what their parents believed, well, you know, it's going to be the same as what they believe, and same with their grandparents. So it's, it's just handed down. There's no sort of, there's no sort of widespread evangelical outreach to other, you know, people that are not in churches, which is completely different to how the rest of Christianity operates.

So as far as [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5103s) narrowing of knowledge, if you think about the fact that now that the Brethren don't have university education and they don't have professional people, their knowledge pool is going to shrink and shrink and shrink over decades to come. They're just going to become less educated, more opinionated, and probably completely strange in the way that they operate, even worse than they are today, I would imagine, if it keeps going the way it's going.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5131s)

Almost primal. Yeah, it's primitive. It's primitive, magical belief.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5137s)

Yeah. Well, we appreciate you coming back on. Do you have plans for Christmas?

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5144s)

Yeah, I mean, my Christmases over the years have changed a lot because obviously, you know, my first family was four young, four boys. Christmas was a big thing and we used to have the full-on Christmas and lots of people around and so on. And now they're growing up with their kids. So, you know, we'll have grandkids coming in and they're also spread out around the world. And that's another thing that would never have happened, I think, in the Brethren in the [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5174s) it has.

I mean, I've got a son who's a maths professor in Vienna in Austria. So we'll do a Zoom call with him and his little boy and his wife, no doubt, sometime on Christmas Day. And then I've got a son who lives in Melbourne, so we'll probably catch up with him by Zoom as well. And then we'll have a lunch on the farm with some of the grandies and the kids. And then we'll have another lunch, I think, probably a few days later [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5205s) the other side of the family, because there's lots of different aspects. Once you have blended families, there's lots of people to catch up with. So yeah, it'll be like fun. It'll be catching up and it'll be just be pottering around, I think, a few days working on the farm, doing, you know, we're doing a revegetation project on the farm. So that's full-time for us.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5224s)

Yeah. Fine. That's awesome.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5226s)

Sounds like fun. Well, thank you so much for coming on and taking time out of your busy schedule to update us. And know you are welcome on here whenever you want.

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5237s)

Thank you very, I'm very, very pleased to, an honor to be asked to come back on. And I just want to say the fabulous work you're doing, Cheryl, and I don't think you probably realize how much of an impact this is having, but you keep, keep doing it.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5256s)

Yeah. Well, you know what? It wouldn't work without the people coming on. So I just very, and it's like, it is people from your generation, Tom, that it's super, super important, right? Like your podcast made such an impact and it's just, it's so important. It's so important for someone of what you went through and where you came from to have come on here. So you are one of my top guests and I just so appreciated you coming on and doing what you did and being [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5286s) authentic and vulnerable as you were. Like that is what really opened up the hearts to everybody that reached out to me and was like, "Is he taking adoptions?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm first."

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5297s)

So, yeah. It's funny, a number of people said to me that, you know, they were in tears listening to it.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5304s)

Yeah. I would cry right now just talking to you.

### [**Tom GRACE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5306s)

I don't understand. It's just the facts. It's just what happened, you know? But it's, you know, there is a lot of emotion, I guess, in what we go through when we leave and how we build our lives. And I'm really pleased that that you found it to be beneficial.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5322s)

Yeah, it was very beneficial. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas and have a good New Year's. Christmas. We'll talk to you next year. Bye now. Much love.

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5329s)

Hi.

Hello, my dear. How are you?

### [**Cassie**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D5333s)

Not too bad. How are you?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D5335s)

Good. Thanks for joining us.

### [**Cassie**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D5337s)

You're welcome.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D5338s)

We've had a lot of happenings this year too, along with your own new podcast started. So, yeah. Do you want to just give the listeners and viewers an update on your life since you were on Get-A-Life, which seems like forever ago? Your podcast just hit home to a ton of people. It was one of our top podcasts. So, yeah, what have you been up to since we've seen you last?

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5358s)

Well, life changed a little bit in the sense that I used to have a little bit to do with those inside, but I was very much cut off as soon as that podcast went to air. And what I found most interesting was that the feedback was more about my comment about Mr. Bruce than any of the other content in the podcast, which was quite mind-blowing considering that some of the things that we covered.

Yeah, it was just shocking that they could park the rest of the podcast aside and they really focused on the fact that I said, "You know, I don't care about Mr. Bruce. I care about what he's doing to get all these millions of dollars from his members." So yeah, that was interesting. And my sisters kind of said that, you know, they'd never speak to me again given the way I spoke about him. I couldn't possibly know him and all of that. So yeah, I got quite a shocking reaction [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5432s) that. Not that I wasn't prepared for it, but you know...

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5437s)

The reality always shocks you though. Like, and it also highlights where their loyalties lie. Like, they're so brainwashed. And like we keep telling everybody, it's always the religion or the cult first over, yeah. And you don't really believe it yourself until this happens and you're like, "Jesus, they are, they are really, really brainwashed."

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5457s)

Yeah, and it's just, it's just really sad. But as far as my life's concerned, yeah, I've been really busy trying to launch my podcast and manage two little kids and then going back to work. It's been pretty full on, but yeah, busy as always.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5474s)

That's awesome. Do you have plans for the holiday season?

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5477s)

We do. We're catching up with family for Christmas Eve. So it's a big, we do the big thing on Christmas Eve. And then we just come home. We have Christmas Day, just my immediate family, my brother and his children, and then his wife's parents as well. So we, yeah, have a little catch up at home and barbecue and just real casual. I think we're going to the beach on Christmas morning and, yeah, a little different to your Christmas, I [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5507s) imagine.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5508s)

Yeah, much warmer.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5509s)

Yes. Mind you, it's been not bad here. I mean, we've just got some snow, just a dump of snow now, but it's been really, it's been gorgeous out. Like, we, I can't complain. This has been a very El Niño winter for us. But yeah. So like a question that we're asking everybody is, what changes do you hope to see within the PBCC?

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5531s)

I just wish that they would scrap the whole hardline separation, really. I think that's what does the most damage. That's where the most trauma comes in. And also, I wish they would take accountable for the things that are perpetrated against their members. You know, they just like to throw everything under the carpet and bury it. And it just does so much damage and it just creates generational trauma [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5561s) just goes on and on and it's just passed from one generation to the next to the next because they refuse to acknowledge it, they refuse to take accountability for it. So I think those two things are the most important.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5576s)

I agree. And it has been a recurring theme when we asked this question that those two requests are coming up. Do you have a message for anyone inside?

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5586s)

I do. I would like my sisters to understand that I hold nothing against them for, you know, the way they've spoken about me or the lack of contact, the lack of care that, you know, you would generally see would be normal for family members. I don't hold any of that against them because I view them with empathy and I consider them also as victims, even though they don't [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5617s) it themselves.

The reason I speak out is because I see them as also victims and I don't want them to have to go through what I, you know, what I've been through or even their children and the next generation. I want them to realize what they're a part of and what they are perpetrating on the next generation unwillingly. So I guess I just want them to know that, you know, I speak out because I love them and I care about them and I care about the next generation. It's not because I'm a, you know, bitter opposer. I'm happy with my life. I don't need to, I don't need to do any of this.

But you know, it pains me watching, you know, the young kids. I often see pictures of my nephews and nieces and, yeah, they look happy and they're having a wonderful life. They're just still very young. But what pains me is that I look at them and I see just such a lost potential. You know, they, for me, they'll never get the chance to live their full potential. They'll never develop their true authentic personalities, especially, you know, the nieces, because from day one, [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5694s) being conditioned and controlled and suppressed. And, you know, the very critical thinking, they're being kept from that very critical thinking that allows them to see through the system that keeps them captive. And it just hurts me to see their little faces and just see, just there's no future for them. They don't know it. They think that they've got this wonderful life, but you know, we see it from the outside, I guess. And that, that's really painful.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5731s)

Yeah. One day, someone, one of your nieces or nephews will see this and will reach out and go, "You know what? That's what saved me." So thank you for sharing that, Cassie. That was amazing.

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5740s)

Yeah. And that's what's sad is that the very fear of that is what keeps my sisters from speaking to me. I mean, one of my sisters said that, you know, she cannot have her daughter knowing or having any contact with me or my kids for, and it's purely for the fear of that one day they might reach out. But wouldn't you want them to have somewhere to go? Like, if it came to that, wouldn't you want them to have... Oh, I've got a little [visitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5770s).

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5770s)

But also, I guess to any, your sisters listening to this, like, if you're afraid that your kid will do that, if you were totally authentically happy with where you are raising your children, you wouldn't need to fear that.

### [**Cassie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5783s)

That's what's sad. Like, yeah, they live in a world of fear and that's sad. They live and everything they do is from a place of fear, which is really sad.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5797s)

I do believe with the amount of content that we have out there, and I mean, you've got, you know, you've started your own podcast with, I mean, any of those nieces and nephews get a hold of that and watch it. The authenticity comes through. To me, when you are your authentic self, you automatically trigger. And I mean, we've got these mirror neurons that activate when with someone that we're speaking to, that authenticity, it lights up. And I firmly believe [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5827s) that is what is going to jiggle around those people who have a sense of their own self versus their indoctrinated self, right?

So I do, yeah, I do believe that when we have this, and I think that's one of the reasons why it's so good to have the video out there. They see your face, they remember you, they get to know you. That's one of the reasons why we did it video and not just audio, so that people get used to our faces. And for myself, it's like, yeah, I do, I want my nieces and nephews to get to know me and be able to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5858s) me while I'm doing this because it is, I believe in truth. I believe that truth prevails. 100%. I don't know, maybe I'm naive, but I just, I really believe that the truth will prevail through all this. It just takes longer, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we thank you so much for coming on. And I know it's really early there for you right now. So thank you for taking, thank you. Yeah, thank you, Sarah. You've done an [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5888s) job. I will put a link out to Cassie's podcast in the description below for those that haven't found it yet. It's a slow one, but it's getting there. Merry Christmas, Cassie. Merry Christmas to all of you. Much love to you.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5904s)

Hi, Rob.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5905s)

Hello, Rob. How are you?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5906s)

Hi, Rob.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5908s)

How are you doing?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5910s)

Very good. Great, thanks. We've got lovely weather down here.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5913s)

I heard. I'm jealous.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5916s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5917s)

I'm on the other side where it's, we've got the white stuff on the ground. So I just wanted to have a quick conversation and we haven't seen you in a bit here on Get-A-Life. And is there any updates since your podcast that you want to let the listeners and viewers know about?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5935s)

Okay, well, I think something I don't think I said in my podcast was, you know how Brethren are strenuously to deny that they break up families, okay? When in my situation, this is how Bruce Hales broke up my marriage, right? He said to the priest, so they excommunicated me, and then I was trying to get back to my family because I didn't want to leave at that time. So what they do, Bruce Hales said to the priest, "Does [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5965s) want to get right?" and "Is he prepared to set his wife free?"

Right now, that's code in the Brethren for the fact that if you want to get back to your family, you've got to first separate from your wife and need to go back to the church and prove you're loyal and blah, blah, blah, blah. So that's coercion. Oh, that's just, that's just absolute blackmail. So it comes right from Bruce Hales's lips, and I'd be prepared to stand up on TV and say that because they just, they just dodged that one.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=5996s)

They, you agree to the separation per their demands, and then they turn around and say that you abandoned your family.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6004s)

Oh, they're so, yeah, they're lighter than the back teeth. But anyhow, yep. You know about this Royal Commission inquiry. It's a, it's a first, well, as far as the Exclusive Brethren go in New Zealand, they've never been investigated by a government commission ever in the lifespan of Exclusive Brethren. So this is actually one-off. And the other thing is, other inquiries that have been in other parts of the world, it's only, it's been related to sexual [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6034s), but in New Zealand, it's actually related to all types of abuse, like just like family law is, like emotional abuse, coercion, emotional blackmail, the whole works.

Hence the reason why the Exclusive Brethren already got on the Royal Commission's radar because they're like, because the breaking up of families is absolute emotional abuse.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6062s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6062s)

That's what I was going to say about that.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6066s)

Well, what are you, what are you hoping will come from the Royal Commission's investigation?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6072s)

Well, so they're going to present a report to the government in March of next year, and I'm hoping that other government departments will come out of the woodwork, like the charity services and things like that, and they'll start looking into the Exclusive Brethren. And I also think that as far as faith-based abuse, closed faith systems like Exclusive Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses, I think, I'm hoping [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6102s) they'll pass law that says abuse is a criminal offense because it's not at the moment, only sexual abuse is.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6112s)

Yeah, I, that would be amazing to get a law passed.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6117s)

Yeah. Yeah, there's so much work to be done in getting governments and government departments to recognize the damage that's done by these groups. And I've had this in conversations like with the Human Rights Commission, for instance, here in New Zealand. And people who come out of these religious groups, they're like refugees in society, but there's no framework for recognizing that. So they don't have access to the same levels of support. So just, yeah, if some of the government departments could just have a proper understanding of the harm that's caused by these groups, that [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6148s) make a huge difference to people trying to escape. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6152s)

And this, this report, is it's, it's coming out in March? Is that what, that's the date, is March?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6157s)

Yeah, it's a deadline, absolutely. And at the moment, like in New Zealand, the Brethren are really, they're keeping under the radar, right? They're not, they're just not, they're not causing anyone any trouble at the moment.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6169s)

No, because they know that they're really trying to behave themselves.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6171s)

I know they've got something coming. You know, it's the first time they've ever been up against it like this. Yeah.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6181s)

Yeah. And if you could, if you could say something to the Brethren inside or specific Brethren members, what would you say to them?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6188s)

Well, yeah, so they've got to stop, they've got to stop, what they're doing at the moment is they'll stop like people's families from talking to their parents and stuff like that. At the moment, they stop it, they prevent it, and through fear and stuff, they've got to stop doing that. They've got to let families talk to each other. You know, you've got to cut the stuff out.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6212s)

I couldn't agree more. It's, yeah, I think that's been the general gist of everybody's thing that they'd like to say or like change they'd like to see is that, you know, this doctrine of separation, you know, it isn't, realistically, it's not protecting anybody. You're just making life miserable or worse for everybody involved.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6231s)

Because I know, like, I've had conversations with my family since I've been out, and I know they miss me, right? And the only thing stopping them from talking to me is the frigging hierarchy. And then in their mind is, you know, that's the only thing stopping them. And if it came from the top that, "Oh, you can, you're allowed to have communication with your family," they'd do it straight away.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6258s)

But it has to be actual true getting rid of that. Like, I mean, we come back to what's been talked already before on this podcast was the Faith and Practice document where they had all these changes they said they were going to adhere to. Here's what I just hope doesn't happen is that things get shook up again, and then they come around and they say, "Okay, well, you know, you're allowed to have this contact with your family, you're allowed to have this contact with your family." That's read out, the box is ticked, but [behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6288s) the scenes, no one challenges it because they know that it's not true, or you've got the priestly visit still happening because people are having contact with your family.

So this is, it is a really hard situation when we're requesting this and sometimes Bruce comes along and he changes the rules for the paper and for the commission, but doesn't necessarily authentically and truthfully change it so that it really happens.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6316s)

Yeah, that's why they need to have a law change to make, in faith-based, close faith-based institutions, it should be a criminal offense for abuse, any type of abuse, and then they'll be, then they have to adhere to that. It's not just a one, a flash in the pan.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6339s)

And it's not even just the separation either, right? Because it's like, it's the priestly visits and the sinning and stuff itself that you have to confess, right? So if they say, "Yeah, you can go visit your family now," but they still do a priestly visit, then that's not okay because they're still asking you to confess crimes and they're still, it's still manipulation, coercion, and blackmail. Yeah, yeah. It's got to be, it's got to be a complete change that I can't even, I don't know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6369s) can't really even fathom how they could change for the better without a complete falling apart of the system because it's based on fear.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6377s)

Yeah, they've still, they've still got to fall apart. I mean, there's still going to be an implosion from the inside. That's, that's still going to happen.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6385s)

And any, any change, any change will have to come from inside, in my view. Like, we can make all these sort of changes, government departments can tweak things, and we can offer support and so on. But like, we can't climb into people's hearts and minds to change what they think. Like, the real, the real pressure for change will come from inside when Bruce Hales realizes he can't push people to a place he thought he could.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6412s)

Yeah, and stricter oversight of their education systems because I think that's right. Not being allowed or skimming over certain subjects or blankly not teaching certain science subjects should be illegal, right? Like, there should be monitoring bodies that can come in and go, "This is unacceptable."

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6432s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6433s)

I agree. I agree. That's something that's been really interesting to me over the last few months is, you know, with the book coming out is the number of current and former teachers from OneSchool Global that have got in touch to talk about how concerned they are about the Brethren in the education system. And I definitely think that better oversight is needed there because the impact that it's having on some of those students is really negative.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6460s)

Yeah, I agree. Is that, is that something that the Royal Commission would have heard about?

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6465s)

Yeah, no doubt. The Royal Commission was covering every aspect of the community. So, and the other thing that I think they need is better pastoral oversight. Like, in the context of those priestly visits, none of those priests have had training in how to deal with people in vulnerable situations, and there's no education about duty of care or how to properly treat people or when to refer things on. Like, I look back at some of the priestly visits [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6496s) had and they were abusive. There was certainly, I certainly didn't come out of them feeling like they'd been helped.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6504s)

Well, that's shocking. I did, I had to kick my priest out one time. That's shocking, shocking abuse on anybody because I've got the power. That's just disgusting.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6517s)

Hey, you used a word, sorry, but you used a word in your book, Craig, voyeuristic, which I found amazing because that is exactly how I felt when I would have priestly visits where these creepy old guys would ask me detailed questions about how me and a 17-year-old made out, right? Like, "Who undressed who first? Where did you touch her?" I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6547s)

[These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6547s) creepy old priests. Oh, the detail that I've never ever forgotten was Roger Kirkpatrick asking me if I was sexually attracted to one of my local priests. Like, on what planet is that a relevant question?

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6559s)

Yeah, I think Bruce Hales himself, he's the one who gets into the details though. He's just a micromanager, but he likes to know everything and he'll tell the priest what to ask. It's just disgusting. It's their version of pornography.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6573s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6576s)

Well, it's very sick cult.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6580s)

Very sick cult. It is, it is. It's very diseased. Well, thank you so much, Rob, for coming on and giving us 15 minutes of your time. We appreciate it.

### [**Rob MCLEAN**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6591s)

I hope you have a great Christmas and a New Year.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6595s)

Yeah, there's lots of Christmas cheer in the background. Thank you. Okay, well, you take care.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6601s)

Okay, bye.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6603s)

Talk to you later. Bye-bye. Hey, Peter. Welcome, Peter. It's been a while since we've seen you or had you on the show. So any updates that you can give us since we've seen you last?

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6615s)

No, I got married about six months ago.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6622s)

Well, that's a big update. Congratulations.

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6624s)

Congratulations. Thank you. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago, I heard from an insider that got passed around, it's been passed around in there that the reason I left was for another woman. So I wasn't surprised to hear that, but it pissed me off a bit.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6644s)

Yeah, their rumors, they love their rumor mills. When people leave, they like, they just make up these ridiculous stories.

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6654s)

Yeah, so they, like, they think that there's no good reason for a person to leave. The only reason can be that they're sick or they're running off with another woman or something like that. It's always got to be something scandalous.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6671s)

I remember one time they did, one of my uncles or something said something to me like, "Did you join the mafia?" I was like, "What? What are you talking about?" He's like, "Well, you always used to read mafia books." I'm like, "So I read a book and now you, you know..." So they thought you ran off with a woman. Have they said any other rumors about you?

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6691s)

I did underestimate how lonely it would be. And, you know, I still have dreams, like probably every second or third night, I have a dream about my family and Brethren, weird dreams and that sort of thing. But I don't get too stressed about it. It's just, it's just what's going on in my head. It doesn't bother me.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6711s)

Yeah. Do you have plans for the holidays?

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6713s)

No, we're just sticking around here. Yeah, well, it's summertime here, so yeah, lots to do around the, yeah, the harbor on the jet ski and, I don't know, just do summertime stuff.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6728s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of the big questions we're asking everybody today is, what are your hopes to see or what changes would you like to see happen from this PBCC movement?

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6742s)

Look, honestly, I don't think they should change. I think the whole thing should just collapse. I think, you know, it would be like trying to pull a weed out and just keep growing. That they're just, yeah, it's a multi-generational thing and they'll just keep on sprouting up bad stuff again. But that's just what I think. I think the whole thing needs to collapse and they all need to go out and find another church or meet at home in little home groups [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6773s) whatever.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6775s)

Sorry, I said, or not, you might want to find out.

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6778s)

Yeah, just, just do what they do. And yeah, I think of it, you know, I think hoping for a change in there, I don't, I think that's, you know, it's been going on 65 years now as bad and possibly even longer than that. It's Craig's book tells us it's, you know, well back it was bad stuff happening. And I think it's just, just think it's been going on so long now that it's [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6813s) I think they're irredeemable, personally. What do other people think?

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6820s)

I'm kind of on your side, Peter. I like, I don't know. I've thought about, yes, it'd be nice for them to change and everything, but like, I don't think there's gonna be change without arrests being made, right? And they can't even accept, like, we had, what is it, Cassie on before. They can't even accept any of the stuff coming out. Like, when people listen to the podcast, they hear one word against Mr. Bruce and they disregard the fact that the person [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6851s) sexually assaulted or raped, right?

Like, it's insane. And all they hear is one thing against Mr. Bruce. So when you have that level of brainwashing, like, could we all deprogram them in some mass education thing? Sure, maybe. But is that ever going to happen? No. I think it's got to implode. And I think it'll be a slow process of laws coming in, hopefully in Commonwealth countries and America, that slowly make it so that people, when something bad happens in the Brethren, can reach out and the person gets arrested, right? And then they will be forced, "If you don't want to go to jail, stop doing that behavior," right? That's what I think.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6892s)

And it wouldn't just be for the people on the inside. If the PBCC was to implode, it would have a huge impact on those of us on the outside as well. But you look at the work that goes into rebuilding every relationship with every new person that leaves. And if your whole family suddenly came back, like, you know, you can't just pick up where you left off. But there's a huge amount of groundwork that goes into rebuilding those connections.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6918s)

Yeah, personally, I don't even think I'd want to.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6921s)

I was going to say, it's very unrealistic and unfair on, you know, us that have worked years and years of therapy or years and years of internal work to overcome the trauma that we've suffered, the generational curse that we've broken. It's very unrealistic and unfair for them to, you know, to be expected to, well, just, you know, help a mass of people. I think, I think through education and with time, you know, as [long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6951s) as there's no Jim Jones event, which I do worry about because they are very much a doomsday cult in my belief.

Yeah, I do think education is really important. This podcast has been really important for educating people that, because like all of us have just touched on, that the immediate thought is that out here is just despair and unsuccess. And far be it from us to just [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=6981s) peaceful lives and actually be successful. You know, not based on, not a measure of success is not our money, but that's not our metric in which we just define whether our lives are being amazing or not. It's whether you have peace, you know, whether you found who you are. And that, those are the important things. So educate yourself on other, by listening to these podcasts and realizing that there is a safe world you can exist in out here.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7009s)

Yeah. Do you have any messages, Peter, for anyone inside?

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7012s)

Just for my family. Yeah, I love them to bits and I miss them every day. The pain just, it doesn't get any less. Yeah. And I just love them to see some sense and, yeah, my heart and hope's still open to them.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7030s)

Yeah. Beautifully said.

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7031s)

Yeah, well said.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7032s)

Well, thank you so much for popping on here. And yeah, you have a great Christmas and a good New Year. Sure. Okay. Merry Christmas. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Welcome, Lara. We appreciate you coming on. How are you doing?

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D7045s)

I'm doing great. And you guys?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D7048s)

Good. Yeah. So do you have plans over the holidays?

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7053s)

I do. So hopefully the plans don't change. I have a very sick child at the moment. Oh, no. Yeah. So my number one thing I wanted to say about holiday celebrations is that, of course, in the Brethren, they didn't even acknowledge that this time of year was Jesus's birth. And you know, the whole, whether you believe or don't believe, the miraculousness of what [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7084s) and how he came to be. And I remember that's actually the deciding factor for how I decided to leave the Brethren. I got invited by people that were never part of it to go to Christmas Eve service.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7100s)

I remember that.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7101s)

Yeah. I remember sitting there like scared to death to walk into the building. Sure lightning was gonna strike it. And you know, like I felt bad for all the people that were gonna get hurt by my bad actions. And then, of course, nothing happened, right?

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7120s)

We've all been there.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7122s)

Yeah. And then I remember as the service went on, and at the end, to this day, "Silent Night" is one of my favorite because they lit the candles and they all sang it and turned the lights down. And I just looked around and I was like, "There's no way on this planet that you're the only ones going to," to the Brethren, I mean, "going to heaven." The Brethren are the only ones. Like, there's no way. And I decided then and there they were [full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7152s) of, I mean, I knew it anyways, right? I'd already decided I was leaving. It was just when and how. And that was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

And I left December 31st. So this December 31st will be my 25-year anniversary of leaving.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7168s)

Wow, congratulations. Congrats. That's amazing.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7172s)

And I just, the thing about Christmas, so we were having this discussion on Facebook like, "What do you like or not like about it?" and "What do you do or don't do?" Presents has always been a really hard thing for me because it felt so worldly, like, and it's so commercialized in the world out here that I always hated it. And then recently [somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7202s) said, "Well, if you think of it from a different light, you get the freedom to give presents. It's not an obligation. You have the freedom to do that now."

And just as the wise men brought presents to Jesus, then you, like the word "present" or "presents" can have multiple meanings. Like, you get to be in his presence, you get to be present in the moment, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7232s) get to give the present, and everyone enjoys the present. So I was like, "I like all the spin on the words." Every year we've always had a tree of some kind or another. Well, my husband and I, which has been almost the whole 25 years, we've been married 21\. So, and then so that's one tradition, understanding and learning about [stockings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7263s). My first year I gave him chocolates and fruit because I had only ever read Laura Ingalls Wilder books and they put fruit and candy because that was a rare thing. And he pokes fun to me to this day about like, "Really, you gave me fruit?"

### [**Peter HART**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7289s)

That's funny.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7290s)

But it's funny and it's fun. And then, let's see, what's another tradition? We always go to Christmas Eve service somewhere. Some years we've gone like to events where they have like caroling. And then, of course, once you have a child, then it becomes even more fun, all the things you want to do. But I always was torn with the idea about lying [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7320s) you have to do this for Santa. So I personally have never been a big Santa Claus fan. I mean, I let her believe it. I just never really said yes or no.

Yeah. And then she got real mad in third grade. She kind of like had figured it out. And I asked her like, "Oh, you know, do you really believe?" because she's asking me. And she's like, "No, I know it's you guys." And I was like, and then she got even more mad because [she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7351s) like, "You weren't supposed to tell me it wasn't you. You're supposed to let me believe." And I'm like, "You already didn't believe." Now I, like, I was wrong both ways for letting her believe and then telling her not to believe.

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7363s)

It's so nice, so nice to see. Like, it makes me think back on my family, and I wish sometimes, you know, our family could have had that discussion just about, you know, whether we believed in the religion or not, you know, growing up. So it's so nice you're able to have that conversation with your child where most of us have been robbed that, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's really refreshing to hear. Thank you.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7386s)

And the other thing was, you know how they always said, "Well, we don't celebrate Christmas because you celebrate his death," yeah, the Lord's Supper. And I was like, "So if you actually believe he died and rose again to save you, why wouldn't you be just as excited that he was born?"

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7413s)

I've had this conversation with my family before.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7414s)

Yeah. You know, what's wrong with one day? You know, I mean, I guess like we always, in our family, I don't know how it was in other places around the world, but we at least got to celebrate our birthdays. And I'm like, "We celebrate our own birth. Why can't we celebrate our savior's birth?"

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7434s)

So what change with this huge movement that we've gotten going, I mean, it's worldwide now, what changes you hope to see come out of the PBCC?

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7443s)

One of the biggest changes that I see, like that's come about recently, is that more because of social media, more and more people's eyes are becoming open, not just ex-Brethren or current Brethren, but around the world about all cults. It's becoming more known that there is cults and they can be about anything and everything and [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7474s) constitutes it. And more and more things coming to light and how it doesn't seem to matter which thing you're involved in that's controlling, whether it be the government or, you know, groups or whatever, is that because of social media, we're able to help people get out.

And so some of the things that I would like for them, people who are still in and the whole organization [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7504s) the Brethren to change, you know, everybody talks about the three F's: fear, finance, and family. You need to stop with the fear-mongering. God's not a fearful being, he's a loving being. Second, your family is your family. I don't care what you believe or don't believe. And third, the finances. Like, hello, you don't want anybody or anything in your finances and controlling people with [finances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7534s) is insane.

Like, you should not have that kind of control over people's lives. And if you have to be that controlling, then what's wrong with you that they don't want to be your friends and participate with you except for because of finances? So I hope that the separation and finances thing is put to bed. I hope that's when my biggest dream would be. I don't care if you want to still believe in that stupid [guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7564s), yeah, BDH, but just stop with the number of families and financial destruction of people.

And then, of course, for me personally, quit covering up sexual abuse, spousal abuse, physical abuse, psychological trauma, the lack of sexual education, and then the re-traumatizing by having all these priestly visits and asking what you think or feel or happened is just absurd. That is no one's business. I mean, if you're trained in it, you know you don't ask [unless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7604s) that person's willing to talk about it. Just please stop with the protecting abusers, whatever kind of abuser they are.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7614s)

And since your podcast came out, did you get any response from them inside there? Has anybody reached out to you to hear your story or try and make amends?

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7625s)

They have no way to. They don't know where I am or have any contact, and they haven't tried. You know, I suppose if they really wanted to, they could.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7641s)

But oh yeah, absolutely, they could.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7643s)

Yeah. Yeah. But what I found interesting, I don't know if everybody knows, but just so that the Brethren people inside the Brethren know, I did go to the FBI and I went to the police. And even though the statute of limitations has expired on my sexual abuse, they can be held accountable civilly for what they've done, whether or [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7673s) I decide to pursue that route, that's still on the table.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7677s)

That's good. That's good. Oh, very good. And one of our final questions we're asking everybody, do you have any messages for anyone inside today?

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7687s)

If you know it's wrong, get out. I don't care what it costs you. I left with a suitcase and knowing my older brother had left, so I knew what was going to happen to me. And saying that you don't have a way out, you do. If you're minded to leave, you will find a way. You find a way for whatever is most...

### [**Ben WOODBURY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7711s)

I agree. And now more than ever, there's a whole network to help you.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7715s)

Yeah, as opposed to when I left at 25, there was nothing, nowhere, nobody. I don't consider it naive, I'm sure a lot of people would. I left only knowing where I was staying that night with two suitcases of stuff. It is so different now. There is, I knew I was leaving and all I knew was I had to answer the phone. Like, but you have to take that step. God can't take it for you, your friends can't take it for you. And thankfully, I had God-fearing people that told me to go home and ask God what to do. They didn't, even though they knew I should leave, they didn't tell me to leave. It has to be your own choice. So you can't make it for anybody. You can't make it for your [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7764s). You have to make it for yourself and decide that it's worth it.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7767s)

Yeah, and the timing will never ever be perfect, so stop waiting for that.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7772s)

Nope.

### [**Craig HOYLE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7773s)

Very good point.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7774s)

That's a really good point, Craig. That's such a good point because it is something we, I mean, myself personally, hear a lot from with the insiders is, yeah, there is just not a perfect time. It's going to be messy, chaotic wherever you take it.

### [**Lara PAYNE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7791s)

Yeah. And it hurts and it's awful and it's ugly. I cried, my parents cried. I didn't think I was gonna get over it, but eventually you do. And it doesn't matter how messy it is, it's so much better to be free. Yeah. So, well, thank you so much, Lara. Yes, good Christmas and New Year's. Yes, we're gonna be with Jason's family this year, as long as everybody's better.

### [**Lane ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7820s)

So, perfect. Merry Christmas.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7821s)

Merry Christmas to everyone. Hey, see you later. Bye. Bye. Welcome, Todd. It's good to see you again. How are you?

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7830s) **COULTER**

Good to see everybody. I can't complain, actually. It's been quite a crazy last six months, but, you know.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7839s)

Yeah. Do you have any updates for us since you've done your podcast that you can share?

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7841s) **COULTER**

I've just been extremely busy at work, you know, working 8, 10, 12-hour days. And then, you know, by the time I get in my downtime, it's, you know, I'm ready for some downtime. So I really haven't...

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7856s)

You did go to the police regarding everything.

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7859s) **COULTER**

Oh, I did, yeah. That's, I have spoken to them a couple times since reaching out to them and talking to them, but I have not gone back in for another meeting with them.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7870s)

But there's an investigation. Oh, yeah.

### [**Todd ADMIRAAL**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7873s)

And I just haven't, I really haven't pursued a lawyer yet. I just, you know, trying to, I just, like I said, I've been so busy on work that that's sort of been a side note for me right now.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7887s)

You have plans to slow down over the holidays?

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7888s) **COULTER**

I, you know, we'll just spend time together, me and my fiance, but we're not, we're not doing too much. Just, it's just been so hectic the last few months that I've just, you know, I just want to literally sit down and relax and watch some football and, you know, just literally get some downtime.

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7913s)

Good for you. Good for you.

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7915s) **COULTER**

What about everybody else?

### [**Cheryl BAWTINHEIMER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7918s)

Yeah, busy. Yeah. Well, it's family's coming back. Yeah. One of the questions we're asking everybody on here today is what change do you hope to see come out of this movement within the PBCC that's going on?

### [**Todd**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7930s) **COULTER**

Well, for me, I hope just to get them exposed. I know there has been exposure so far. I really think, especially in Australia and New Zealand, it's been, you know, I think it's for it to start there is probably the greatest thing that could happen. So for me personally, for judges to see this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7958s)

And to follow, yeah.

### [**Todd COULTER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7959s)

I don't know what it's like in New Zealand, Craig, but.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7967s)

Yeah, I think there's been a, well, there has been a lot of publicity recently, a lot of attention on who the brethren are. And it was really interesting, I did a radio sequence a couple of nights ago, two hours of live radio on one of our biggest radio broadcasters. And so many messages from listeners who are like, "I live in this town and it's full of brethren," and like, "What is up with this and what is up with that?"

And I think there's, like New Zealand has the highest number of [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=7997s) per capita in the world. They're very visible here and people are very aware of who they are, but there's still so much sort of confusion and fascination with who they are. And we find every time the brethren are in the news in some way, there's just this outpouring from the public and from former members, and also in New Zealand as well, from from current members.

And I think that's a point I would make to people on the inside, is all of this publicity that's been [happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8028s) about the brethren, it's not the outs, it's not the opposers that are driving it. It's people on the inside that are driving it, so I'm so concerned about what's happening with Bruce Hales and the rest of the leadership, that they are choosing to provide information, they're leaking things to bring about change. So there's publicity, it's people on the inside that are driving it, not us.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8052s)

Yeah, that's interesting.

### [**Todd C**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8053s)**OULTER**

I agree. I think that's where it's going to start, is people on the inside realizing what this podcast is doing and and realizing that they have to start exposing from the inside. I think it really is going to collapse on itself, to be quite honest. From people I see and just how they act now, you can sort of see it imploding on itself, and really bringing it to the head.

[Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8083s) everybody has said, is you know, right up to people trying to be told that they can't talk to their parents. I just had an uncle pass away. He wasn't part, he was part of the brethren many years ago, but I reached out to my father to wish him my condolence because it was his brother. And he did not answer for my call and he just sent a brief message, like literally four words, saying, "Thank you, got your voicemail." He didn't want to talk to me.

[You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8119s) know, and I'm okay with that. But my uncle really stressed in his will that he had no members at his funeral or service. So we had to be very, very careful who found out about the service and who was attending it. And I have to say, my uncle that is out that handled it did a very good job and nobody showed up at that service that was not supposed to be there.

So I think that in itself is a great movement where, because I know my father said that he would help with the funeral costs, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8167s) I know you all would know what they'd want to do when they take, they try to take control of the situation. And I know my uncle would not, my uncle that was out would not have let that happen. So I think we fulfilled my uncle's wishes in that regards. But you know, obviously it was a sad moment to see him go. He was only 73 or 74\.

But you know, I'm just glad he doesn't suffer. He went through a tremendous amount and to realize that he doesn't have to worry about it or think about it ever again and can be in a much better place is, I'm happy for it for that. So I think the movement is happening. And regarding 2024, I think there's going to be, with all you've done, Cheryl, Lane and many others, I think there's going to be a big movement. And there's going to be a lot [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8230s) exposure. And all these leaders are going to realize that this is going to come to an end very, very quickly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8240s)

And once Craig's books get into everybody's hands, from what I've heard, that book obviously outlines exactly what they need to be able to dive into, which is the generational trauma. So, Todd, do you have a message that you'd want to send to anybody inside?

### [**Todd COULTER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8260s) 

Well, my message would be to anybody in there, just really consider what you're part of. Really consider. I know many in there that are stuck and really want to get out. And my message to everybody would be make that move and get out now, whatever it may be. Because I think like Ben said it many times, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8290s) worry about what BDH would do when he knows his time is done and people are just going to leave. And I worry about that with my parents and others that are so in with them in there. I would just plead with any of them, my brothers, sisters, family members in there, reach out to us, talk.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8318s)

Yeah.

### [**Todd COULTER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8319s)

We can help you, guide you, and get you into a much better and safer place.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8325s)

And also all those of us on the outside, we have to those who inside, we've been in your shoes. We know what it's like to feel like this. We know what it's like, that fear and confusion and so on. So we're speaking from a place of knowledge here. Not, we're not just firing in from the outside. We've all been there ourselves.

### [**Todd COULTER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8346s)

Yeah, and and we, and I think the coolest thing about this is you're meeting people from all over the world that have been in so many different situations coming out. Everybody has somewhat of a different adventure leaving or how they left or why they left. And I think, like you said, Craig, I think that's the biggest message, is that we've all been in their shoes and scared about leaving or scared about just getting out.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8376s) there's thousands of us, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that are all at different stages, all that, you know, it's going to mark seven years for me in June. So you know, it's, I don't know, it's hard to say. It's just the, I think the last thing I would say before I get off would be to show how successful everybody has been here, exactly, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8406s), that has come out. And I think that's the biggest thing I want to show my parents. Of course, they'll never come out with it, is that we've been in good relationships, we've found our way, we have good jobs, we've all enjoyed life in many different ways, and that you can make it. There's, so what BDH is preaching, saying you're never going to make it out here, is a lie. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8435s)

What a beautiful way to end that, Todd. Well said. Thank you. Thank you so much, my dear.

### [**Todd COULTER**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8440s)

Very nice seeing everybody. Yeah, thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8444s)

Take care, Todd. And our next guest is Julie from BC. 

**Julie Fletcher**

Hello, Cheryl. How are you?

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

 How has things been since you've done your podcast?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8460s)

Pretty quiet, you know, back to work and, you know, trying to get back into the groove of things. So, yeah. Do you have plans for the holiday season? Yeah, Christmas. Usually like my girls and I have always had this tradition of Christmas Eve opening a present of new pajamas. And then we put them on and then Christmas morning we get up and we're in our new pajamas.

I [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8490s) it. We usually do like a family photo and then we open presents and make breakfast and have a turkey out ready to start making sort of like afternoon-ish. But this time I'm actually having surgery Wednesday, so it's going to be up to Papa Ron and the girls to cook Christmas dinner. Oh wow. So I mean, I'm sure I'll be in there too because, you know, like manage, oh yeah, oversee [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8520s) anyways.

So yeah, we open presents and we cook turkey and all the fixings. And as you can see, I have a tree up. Gorgeous tree. I love it. I actually hate the tree, but it looks good. It does look good. Yeah, absolutely. So I'm like, no, no, I need, actually I want one of those pencil trees that doesn't take up as much space. Yeah, that's what I have behind me. So my living room is really small. Anyways. So I think, yeah, that's pretty much [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8550s) what we do for Christmas.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8553s)

I love it. Pretty simple. Yeah. And you've any updates that you've got since your podcast? I know you sent me some pictures that I really want to share that maybe you can walk the listeners and viewers through of what these are. Oh, yeah.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8568s)

Haven was really like a kid that loved to share and was really full of joy, and she gave so much to the community she was part of. Like the Baha'i faith people come in and do a JY program and so she would like participate in service projects and stuff like that. And so some of these are Baha'is, some of them are my neighbors, and together we all put together the Small But Mighty program because some of the kids in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8598s) complex, their moms are either not at home or don't cook.

And so if you go back to the first one, I was just going to mention who's who. In the gray blue is Ken, and the next is Tiffany and Shay. Shay and Ken are together. And then there's Amy, she's a teacher, and myself and Grace. And Grace works at the high school. And Amy's husband is also a teacher. He's not in the picture, but he was there.

Yeah, so I love the color of the shirts. So I wanted to get more, but then I couldn't. So we are gonna have to do like a different color, which sucks, but it is a great color. You know, it just radiates the joy and smile, eh? Right. That was kind of the idea. And so we have like this program not too far from my house called Nourish Cowichan. And it's a really amazing program. They put together bags of food for the kids in the schools, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8666s) the schools in the whole area, Duncan, Seanigan, Maple Bay, North Cowichan.

And these are sort of like the different neighborhoods. And so we went to Nourish Cowichan and Fatima, the lady who runs it, she was like super on board with helping us provide us the food. And it's all through donation. Like big businesses will donate money to this program. And she's like, "Initially, this is what I wanted to do, but I didn't know how to go about doing it." So anyway, she's like, "Come on [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8699s). We'll get the kids involved."

And sort of as a service project. So here's two of my kids and Amy's daughter. And we were all cutting vegetables and some grapes. And then we iced the cakes that you saw earlier. And then we had a wonderful time with the kids. We gave them spaghetti and mac and cheese and veggies and garlic bread. And they were so happy. And sometimes the only time they get food is when they're at school. And this happened to be like a non-instructional [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8732s), so there was nothing.

Anyway, so one of the other moms came with her younger kids and afterwards we asked like, "So, you know, what did you think of it? Is there anything we could change and make it better?" And she's like, "Oh, it was great. You know, my kids went to sleep right away." So she was pretty happy. So that's pretty much what we've been doing. They're gonna do another dinner in a few days. It's gonna be turkey dinner. It's for Christmas for the kids. Now, Baha'is don't actually celebrate Christmas. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8762s) do acknowledge Christ, but they don't see him as a savior of the world, which is, you know, the whole reason why we celebrate Christmas is to remember his birth. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8774s)

So one of the questions that we're asking everybody today is what, what change do you hope to see within the PBCC through all these podcasts and these movements that we've all gotten ourselves into?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8790s)

Well, one, I hope that it sheds light. Like the truth is out there now. It can't be hidden anymore. You know, we have a space to speak our mind, to speak what's in our hearts, what our experiences have been. It can't be denied. And I hope that changes what happens. I mean, really what I ultimately, I'd love it to just implode, but I don't want to ask too much, but you know, anything's possible. You know, you have to hope and dream for the big.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8824s)

So yeah, exactly. And do you have any messages for any insiders in there or just to the PBCC in general?

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8836s)

Well, yeah, like there are people out there who are willing to help you. There's, you can, there's resources out there that will help you wherever you need. You don't need to worry about having a flat tire. There's BCAA you can call and they'll come and tow your vehicle. There's, you know, food bank if you are lacking in food. There's so many resources out there. And not only just resources, there's lots of us ex-brethren who are here to help in a hot second, right? So yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8873s)

And that really has been alone. Yeah, there, that's been the consensus today with everybody, is that there's thousands of us out here that are willing to help.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8874s)

Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And I know that it's a daunting thing. Like I remember the day, lately what I've been thinking about is the day that I left and how much it felt like leaving prison in a way. And I actually put myself in a bubble, I guess, in order to protect myself because I had no goals. I didn't know where I was going in life. I didn't even know what my next step was going to be. I didn't know what I was going to [encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8915s) or how I was going to manage life in general. And it just seems so overwhelming.

And I wasn't in a like a good situation. I wish I could reconnect with the person that I was where I was staying, but I haven't been able to locate him. But I was able to find my grandfather and build a relationship with him and then through that, find my way in life. So I know some have had, you know, probably better plans than I did, plans in general. I thought I had a plan, but it, you know, it wasn't the worst case scenario. Like honestly, looking back, a lot of bad things could have happened to me.

I feel pretty blessed. I had an angel. You know, I feel like the taxi driver was an angel in a way. And Ray, the guy that I was living with for a short period of time, you know, didn't mistreat me. You know, he, I don't, without getting into too much detail, but it felt like he was a little pushy. But, on the, you know, he was a great guy. Didn't mistreat me at all, which, you know, when you're leaving the brethren and you really don't know who you're dealing with, it's quite daunting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=8992s)

Yeah. Cause it's a foreign world, right? And you don't know what to expect. Yeah, I agree. And I mean, like we, you know, there's no time is the right time, right? It's just you've got to be able to just make that step and just know that you're going to be provided for, right? That even though it's scary, that when you reach out and ask for help, it's going to be there. It will be there.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9011s)

Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. And just know that you will find the strength and the tenacity to make that move when you know. Like for me, it was, I had no plans in leaving. It was like literally a spur of the moment decision. I'd gone to prayer meeting, something happened after prayer meeting. And then we all went to bed and my brother had been staying up drinking and it was just like, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9045s) out of here.

But then I'm like, I don't know where I'm going. I cannot ask my mother or my brother for my father's or my grandfather's information because we all know they're not going to give it to us. Yeah, yeah. And I knew if I had to go, if I went out the back door or the main door that we used, my brother would stop me. And so I jumped out my bedroom window. Wow. So I mean, because I just wasn't about to be stopped [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9075s) any way.

And then he did come and, you know, find me the next day. I left a note on my bed for my mom, and I don't even remember what information I even put in there, but obviously something that he could find me because he was, the next day he's at Ray's house. And I said to Ray, "Don't open the door. Don't answer. It's my brother and I'm not going." But he did anyways. And I just flat out said to my brother, "I'm not coming with you, so you can just leave."

And then I remember the day that my [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9105s) grandfather came to pick me up and we went out somewhere. We got onto the main drag and the next thing I know is Dave and Yvonne Boram are in their big 15-passenger van and my mother's behind them. I felt, you know, I understand why some feel like they've been stalked and harassed. It happened to me too. And yeah, they used to have PVs with me and I just, you know, as I said in my podcast, I just told them where to go.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9135s)

This takes the determination, right? You have to have the determination to just want your own freedom in your own life.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9142s)

Yeah, and it's worth it. Having the choices, I mean, it's overwhelming to begin with, but I would never give it up now. Would never go back to not being able to think for myself or to question, because I am an analytical person. I question everything. So, you know, this is one of the main reasons why I'm not in the brethren, because I just don't fit into their peg hole, if you will. Like, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9178s)

Yeah. So. Oh, well, thank you so much. I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to give us an update. And yeah. Sounds good. You have a great Christmas. I hope to hear everybody else's too. Yes.

### [**Julie Fletcher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9190s)

It is, it was. Christmas everybody, and to everybody who just left, I hope it's the best first Christmas ever.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9197s)

Yes. Thanks so much, Julie. Thank you. And our next guest is Alona. Hello Alona, welcome. Hi, how are you? I'm good. That's good. How, do you have plans for the holiday season?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9214s)

We do. We're actually going to go to a, hopefully go to a church service with friends on Christmas Eve, I think, for the first time in a couple years. And then I think we're going to have supper with them. And then Christmas Day is our day for our family because it's also Jerry's birthday. So we have Christmas day is our day to have all the kids. So hopefully we get all our kids and all our, everybody we want in our house for a big meal on Christmas day night. Perfect.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9254s)

That's awesome. So one of the biggest questions that we're asking everybody in today's podcast is what changes do you hope to see the PBCC make?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9268s)

The biggest change I would hope that they would make is to get rid of their very, very anti-Christian doctrine of separation.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9280s)

That seems to be the theme of everybody today.

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9214s) 

I wish that they would allow their members to have a true link with Jesus that doesn't involve anything else. And I wish that they would allow them to do their own research and find, find their own answers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9303s)

I agree. I absolutely agree. So your podcast really, really went fast and hard. What updates do you have since you've done your podcast?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9214s)

My favorite updates are I've gotten lots and lots and lots and lots of families that have reached out from the Brethren. We're actually going, we have a few families that we're actually going to meet up with. Obviously nobody knows who they are, nobody's going to know who they are, but there's lots of brave people in there that have reached out for help. And we've sat in, we've sat in their houses and listened to their, listen to meetings on Zoom and stuff. It's kind of funny.

Yeah, yeah. But yeah, there's a lot of people in there that have reached out and that's exactly what I was hoping for. I was hoping [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9365s) I was hoping to get just to let people know they could reach out to us. And I think that was the most...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9372s)

The biggest takeaway that we wanted from your podcast, because you were just another family that were was able to do what you got, you got out with all your kids intact. And I think that that is, there's a lot of families in there that that sit on the fence, right?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9389s)

Yeah, so many. Yeah. And they don't really, they they're too scared to even talk to each other about it. Most of them don't know anyone else who is on the fence the way they are, which makes me sad. And I wish there was some way we could, I wish there was some way they could find each other, but it is, it's scary. Like people said, like people end up changing their mind at the last minute and nobody wants to take that risk.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9419s)

And from the insiders that you've spoken to with one foot in and one foot out, what are you finding is the the obstacle that they're up against in making that final decision?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9431s) 

Family. Yeah, it all comes down to family. In fact, finances were such a huge thing for us that I'm surprised, I'm surprised that it's not more that. Maybe that was just a hang-up I had, but every single family I've talked to is family. That's who it is. And it's usually their mom. And that's what it was for me too, was my mom.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9455s)

But yeah, I mean, and we've spoken with other people on this podcast today that it is, is that doctrine of separation. Even if something does come around with change within it, is that it's got to be legit, authentic change that happens, not just something where a box is ticked. And it needs to be an actual law of some sort where that this kind of thing can't happen.

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9481s)

Right. And they can't hold it over their heads. Like it has to be, they have to say that you're, you know, like they say, "Oh, it's up to the family." And then, but there's this underbelly of like, if you do it, you're going to be in trouble. And that's what's got to go.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9499s)

And you're getting the priestly visits. Yeah. And people don't like those. Exactly. Yeah. I agree. What, do you have any messages for anyone inside there?

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9512s)

From what we've been hearing that's happening there, my message would be get out now. Get out and deal with whatever you need to deal with after you're out. It's become an emergency, I would say. And I thought it was an emergency when we left, but it's a lot more so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9532s)

And would you say now, experiencing what you experienced leaving and then listening to what's happening now, would you say it's almost, you don't really need to have the full-fledged plan? Get out and just...

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9546s)

Just get out. Get out and reach out and let somebody help you. There's tons of support out here. Even if it means you have to dump your house and everything, get out. Come live with somebody, live with somebody for a minute till you get your feet on the ground. Yeah, just get out before you lose your kids or, I mean, for me, that's what I see a lot, is there's people that they're frantically trying to get out. In the [meantime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9576s), their kids are getting married.

One person I was talking to right after my podcast came out, she just found out she was going to be a grandma. I know the feeling. I can't imagine leaving my daughter knowing that she's gonna have a baby. Yeah, but that's reality for a lot of people in there and I don't know, I don't know what to say about that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9604s)

Yeah. "Get out and reach out." That's a really good slogan. That needs to be on a t-shirt somewhere.

### [**Alona**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9607s)

Yes. Yeah, just get out of there. It's an emergency at this point. Yeah, I would 100% agree with that. Yeah. Yeah, especially, especially if you want to keep your family together and you want to keep, if you want to raise them to be faithful, if you want to raise them in a, you know, in a Christian household, get out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9638s)

Yeah, I agree. Oh, well, thank you so much for taking the time out of your work day to slip this in. I appreciate it.

### [**Alona**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DApx5mtNbqf4%26t%3D9644s) 

Thanks for organizing it. That's cool. Welcome. Yeah, excited to see everybody's updates.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9651s)

Thank you so much, Alona, for jumping on. And have a great Christmas and a New Year. You too. Take care. What a fantastic podcast. Yeah, there's a lot of people. I want to remind everybody to please make sure that you subscribe to Get-A-Life and make sure you like every podcast. It just helps the algorithm stay up to the top. Comment if you can, and that comment can just be a thumbs up, but it's super, super important in order to keep getting through all the algorithm that's put out there, is that we have to have the communication on each podcast.

We also have a Get-A-Life site now. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9693s) a shop site, but it also has links to all of the books that are out there. You can find Craig's book on there that is just, I think, I think the links take you into Amazon and all the different countries. And there's also a place to donate on there. All proceeds, there's not much profit that comes off of theirs, any profit that we do make will go to the leavers fund that we have set up.

And yeah, thank you so much, Craig, for staying on and joining us. We lost Ben halfway through, he had to go to work, but I [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9723s) really appreciate, I think all of the ex-member community appreciate how much time and effort you have put into this movement, because it's a lot. Not only in the job that you do day to day, but in, I can't even imagine. I've just started writing my book and it's a lot. It is a lot to get through to finish a book from front to finish and sent to a publisher, get everything done.

So, and just all of the publicity that's come out of it, I think that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9753s) has been a huge, huge boulder that rolled off of the mountain towards the PBCC when your book came out. So if you have not read Excommunicated yet, please get it. Reach out to Craig if you're needing to have one. Go to our site, it will have one. All links that you need will be below this podcast. And yeah, we just wish everyone a very, very happy 2024\. We have new things happening with Get-A-Life, so [please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9783s) stay tuned with that. And yeah, we're just excited. We're excited with everything that's happening for the next year. Anything you guys want to add?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9790s)

Just have a Merry Christmas. And honestly, if you're in there and you're thinking about it, don't wait till 2025\. Make 2024 your year. Get the hell out of the PBCC before it explodes. Okay? Get off the X, as they'd say in the military, because there's incoming fire. And yeah, have an amazing year. Happy New Year. Merry Christmas.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9817s)

To those people on the inside, all those that we have heard from and continue to care from, thank you so much. And we couldn't do this without you. And for anyone who's thinking about reaching out, always more than happy to hear from you. And I think people often want to make sure when they talk to me that what they say isn't going to end up in the paper. Instead, I would say that the thing that really marks all of us as journalists and podcast hosts isn't what we're saying [publicly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9847s), it's all the things we're told that we're not repeating. Because what we're saying to you publicly is just a fraction of what we're hearing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9856s)

That's so true. It is true. And we don't, I mean, the only things that get repeated on are ones that I am given permission to. So confidentiality is of utmost, like we just take that very, very near and dear to the heart because we know what it was like leaving and that confidentiality is super important. So yeah, just because Craig's part of a, you know, he's a news reporter, doesn't mean he's going to be airing your stuff.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9878s)

Very good point. And Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apx5mtNbqf4&t=9883s)

Take care, everyone. Let's make 2024 the year that this all happens. Much love to everyone.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
