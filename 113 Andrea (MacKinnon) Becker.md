## Summary

Get-a-Life smashes through the Brethren’s “wall of separation” with this first ever interview of a current and participating member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.  After listening to the mandatory Friday night recording of Cult Messiah Bruce D. Hales, and before attending the mandatory Saturday morning Cult Bible Reading, PBCC “sister” Andrea Becker took the time to record this groundbreaking podcast with Get-a-Life’s Cheryl and Lane.
Andrea Becker (originally MacKinnon from Montreal) lives with her husband Lyle and two daughters in the German town of Bad Endbach. Andrea tells how their belief in the Brethren‘s doctrine was shaken by the blatant dishonesty of the system and the cruel treatment of leavers. Together with her husband, they planned to leave rather than bring up their daughters in a cult that treats women as inferior and voiceless servants to the men. With their plans all made, but kept entirely secret from their unsuspecting local brethren and their many relatives in the cult, Andrea recorded this interview telling of both the elation and the fear that filled them as they faced their D-day – just one week ahead.
Did their months of careful preparation succeed? Did they escape as a family, unscathed?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=53s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm Lane and I'm here today with Cheryl and a very special guest, Andrea McKinnon, who is not only my cousin, but a childhood friend. And for the first time ever on this podcast, we have someone who is currently inside the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. They are not an ex-member yet.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=79s)

This podcast was filmed on the 16th of June, 2023, one week before Lyle and Andrea planned to leave the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=89s)

Andrea, so good to have you on here. Where do you want to even start? Like, what you're going through right now, why don't we tell the listeners a little bit about where your headspace is even at right now?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=101s)

Yeah, my head, it feels like a blender.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=106s)

What if we start at the beginning then? When you were 18 years old, you thought about leaving. You started out with a plan. How did you make friends on the outside when you were that young? Why don't we start there?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=122s)

Okay, well I kind of, like any other person would, they reconnect with an old school friend. I was shopping at Walmart one day and there was a school friend, because of course I'd gone to public school for grades four, five, and six in Montreal and reconnected with. I didn't make too many friends there, of course, because you're Brethren and you wear, I had to wear a crocheted scarf and I had to wear jean skirts and I couldn't play Sim Earth on the computer.

So I was made fun of. I was bullied bad at school, really bullied bad because I was the kid with the scarf and I couldn't watch TV. And [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=159s) know, when they'd roll in the big TVs to show something in the classroom, I had to always go in the hall.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=163s)

Because of that?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=166s)

Yeah, absolutely. You feel left out, you feel like a weirdo, right? And I made probably two or three friends in elementary school. I was shopping at Walmart one day, one of them was a cashier, and I just reconnected. It was so weird, I would like find excuses to go to Walmart to talk to him, and it kind of sparked something in me.

And I wanted, I realized I wanted to leave. I don't really remember too terribly much about what my head went on at that time.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=200s)

18 then? 18?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=201s)

18, it was 2005\. And I made my mind up pretty quick. I left within a couple months. He met me at the mall, we got a little pay-per-minute cell phone at TELUS. And the night before I left, I think I told you, Lane, didn't I?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=219s)

I was so scared. Do you remember telling me? You told me in the basement of my dad's house. And we were down there, that was where we always hung out in the basement. And you were like, "Lane, I've got to tell you something." And I remember you telling me by the back stairs of that house. I'll never forget it. And I was so like, but the fact that you confided in me, I felt like I had a bigger secret than any of the other kids. So I was so excited for you.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=247s)

I don't know why I knew I could tell you. I mean, you and me kind of were always, ran in a pack anyway, didn't we? When we were little.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=254s)

Yeah, we did.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=255s)

Our older siblings always kind of bullied us and looked down on us. Even though I was the same age as your older brother. Actually, two weeks older. You and me kind of were always stuck by each other's side and stuck up for each other and kind of were the little rebels that...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=269s)

Yeah, Lee and Val would pick on us and make us go run all the errands and do all the stupid stuff, or we had to wait in the car while they did the fun thing. Yeah, leave us out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we got along really well and I think honestly, you know, I know we were both bullied, right? And it was a really close friendship that we had. So when you told me that, I wanted to help you in any way that I could because I was just jealous, basically.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=299s)

Yeah, and I whipped out my little cell phone. Did I show you my cell phone?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=302s)

You did. You did.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=303s)

How long were you out for? Three years. Oh wow. And where did you go? I stayed in Montreal. I rented various apartments and rooms and Lane was always there. I mean, there was never a week I didn't see Lane through those whole three years, honestly.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=317s)

Okay folks, so we're going to change topics right now and go back into Andrea's headspace about what's really happening right now in her life while she's still in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. What's that like, Andrea? You want to leave, am I correct?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=338s)

Yeah, we are leaving in one week. It's the planned day. And it feels, it's hard to describe how it feels. Like you are happy, so happy that you're going to have a new life. The way I feel, okay, I am sad about leaving my family and I'm nervous about what's ahead. And I'm anxious about how my children are going to react. We're changing their lives forever and they don't have any say in it. That's really scary.

It's a big responsibility to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=368s) doing that to two lives, but we know we have to do it for their benefit. Because we've lived all the way till 37 and 36, me and my husband, and it's just not for us. We can't, we don't feel happy. So how could we create two children and they'll end up somehow miraculously being perfectly happy in here? It's not going to happen. You know, they've got our independent streak, they've got our outspokenness, they've got our rebellion, they've got our backbone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=398s)

You know? What was the defining moment for you? Like, what was the defining moment where you're like, "Hmm, something's not right here," and getting that nudge in you saying, "Maybe we need to leave." Was there a defining moment in that? Or was it a gradual buildup?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=418s)

Both, honestly. I have felt deep down feelings that I've kept in for probably, I would say, nine years inside me. Little things that happen that you just innately don't agree with, but you immediately squash them down because you do not say that you don't agree with things. Like for instance, the time of the meeting has changed, or you know, you have to go to someone's house for break and you just kind of can't be bothered to talk to them.

Or you have to have someone for a break and you kind of can't be bothered to talk to them because you don't know if you like them. You're just put together with them. And it's all these little things that just irritate you year in, year out, and you push them away, you push them away, you push them away and come up and smile.

I mean, I actually found an email that I wrote to a friend in 2014 and I described how unhappy I was and how I just couldn't, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=476s) didn't feel happy just literally living my life as a housewife and as a mother. And you're expected to just give of yourself constantly and you kind of get nothing back. Your husband loves you, your children love you, you have that, but what else? You can't get a job. I'm in a country with another language. I'm a million miles away from my family. Like, I was super depressed.

So from then, probably, I would say from 2014, I had thoughts that I was squashing away subconsciously, not even admitting them to myself, really. Yeah. Every now and then I would google Lane because I missed him. I never forgot about him. I never, ever forgot about him. And I didn't care what anyone said that he did or didn't do. Like, I still loved Lane. We went through hell together.

And so one, I don't know when it was, I think it was December, and that is where it began. And I'd always googled him and it would come up the same [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=536s) clips and then there was a new one and it was Lane on Blackballed. And I was blown away at what Lane had been through and his bravery at sharing his story. And I saw you, Cheryl, and saw, of course, that led to the Get A Life podcast.

And I had to be really careful how I watched them. I didn't want my husband to find out. And so I would have to watch a few minutes here and a few minutes there. And all the while inside feeling, I shouldn't be doing this, I shouldn't be doing this. Oh my goodness. But you were caught, you just wanted to know the truth of these stories that had been happening to people that you didn't know. I reached out to Lane and it began very innocently, didn't it, Lane? You can, you remember more of that call than I do?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=587s)

Well, first I got an email, you know, using a pseudonym, and it stated that it knew some of the things that I'd said on the podcast on Blackballed with James DiFiore, that they were true, because she said, "I know that this is true, because you told me about it the day that it happened," or right after it happened. And to tell you the truth, I didn't know who that was right away. I was shocked. And I was like, "Oh my goodness."

And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=617s) I think I gave permission to give my phone number and think Cheryl or someone gave my phone number to you. And I got that phone call and I immediately recognized your voice, or after a second to think. And I was like, "Oh my God, Andrea, you called me." And I knew what that would have meant for you to call me because of the fear and knowing that I'm this opposer that talks against the church, that's the worst of the worst, right? So I still commend you greatly for making that phone call.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=650s)

I had to. I knew I had to. I just, I had to tell you what I wanted to tell you and I just kind of didn't care. I thought, well, if you're doing these podcasts, you're putting yourself out there and you're also telling us that we can trust you, because you were asking, you know, for anyone to contact you at this email address. And I thought, okay, well, I'm just gonna do it because my gut tells me I have to. And to corroborate on your story, it doesn't matter if I could help you in your police case, [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=680s) gonna do it.

If I find out, well, the truth's got to be told somehow. My head knew that above everything else. And I still remember it was a cold December evening because we've got a time difference between us and I was absolutely shaking. I was like nervous and I was so excited to hear your voice again.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=700s)

It was so nice to hear your voice and I remember, you know, I wanted to reassure you that it was okay because you said, I could tell the fear in your voice. And I reminded you that there is nobody for me to tell, right? There's only love out here. And I remember you telling me, "Lane, I want you to know we're happy inside and we're never going to leave." And I remember [telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=731s) you, "That's okay. There's nothing wrong with that as long as you're happy." Right? Yep.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=738s)

And you said to me, "I can hear the fear in your voice. It's okay." You know, and because you understood how scared I was. And I wanted to tell you, you know, I'm just, I'm just telling you this one thing. I'm like, make my position clear, as they say. Yes, yeah. But it's wild because I remember saying that to you and believing it. And that was a month where I just had decided I'm going to be a really good peeb lady. I'm going to pray all the time and we're going to have company. We were having company nearly every weekend and I was the most [miserable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=768s) I'd been in years.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=769s)

Really? Yep. The Plymouth Brethren are the one chosen church by God, the creator of the infinite universe with billions and billions of planets and stars and galaxies, chose the Brethren to be his one perfect church. Now, shouldn't that be the happiest place in the world? Shouldn't everyone be very happy and lucky to be there?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=790s)

Absolutely. We should be dancing in the streets. Everyone would be running to the doors to try to get in, you think.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=797s)

But so we started talking, and you started listening to more of the podcast, didn't you?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=806s)

Yeah, I'd listened to yours and Cheryl's on Blackballed at that point, and then I started listening to the Get A Life. And so that, it really did strike something in me. And then interestingly enough, I by accident discovered that my husband was watching the podcast too. And I was absolutely so scared. I didn't even dare say it to him because if I tell him that I know he's [watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=837s) the podcast, then I'm admitting I'm doing it because I know what they are, right?

So one day we were alone at home and I said, "We cannot watch these. It's gonna make us have a doubt. It's too risky. We have to stop." And he wasn't really giving me too much of an answer. So on I went watching them, on he went watching them. And I eventually told him I was talking to Lane. I'd been talking to Lane for probably six weeks at this time [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=867s) not telling my husband.

But it was almost like once the ball started rolling, you couldn't stop. Yeah. And then we started having conversations, me and my husband. Just like, really, we were scared to even talk about this stuff together. It was huge. It was scary. We'd usually end up in the kitchen with our coffees when the kids had gone to school. And it just got a little bit more open and a little bit more open.

And we admitted to each other that we really were seeing through the Brethren and we both really were quite unhappy, each on our own terms, but not with each other. Yeah. And the interesting thing is, I had been telling Lyle for years, on and off. I would have good times and I would have bad times. But when I had a low, I would just tell him how unhappy I was. And I didn't know why.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=926s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=927s)

And I would just think, I'd be doing the dishes and think, you know, if I just would go out of this house and not come back, they'd all be better off without me. Honestly, I contribute nothing to this household and I'm worth nothing. And I'm so unhappy. I just don't want to be here. I have nothing that makes me happy. And yet it wasn't with Lyle and the kids.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=948s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=949s)

But I couldn't understand. It was this thing inside me that just, it was the pressure of the lifestyle and the restrictions put on me and the expectations put on me that I didn't know I was absolutely just not coping with.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=962s)

Yeah, just explain a little bit more on that to the listeners and viewers on how much expectation is put on a mother and a female inside there. Give just a little bit of insight into that on how pressurized it is and what kind of lifestyle that is.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=984s)

It's so funny to try and explain it because it's just my life. It's currently my life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=990s)

One more week of it.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=992s)

For a Brethren mom, like you go to school, you were a secretary for a couple years and you get married, hopefully, if some guy asks you, because you don't go asking them. And hopefully you love them and hopefully you can cope with where they live because you've got to move there. You don't stay in your own meeting, you move there.

So I met Lyle on an overseas group in New Zealand, actually. And me and Lyle, just this quiet German boy and this crazy loud [Canadian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1023s), just clicked and got married two years later. And so, yeah, you know, it's all exciting. You move to Germany and then your expectation is you don't work, you keep your house perfect, clean all the time, you entertain, you have company every weekend or every second weekend, and you have babies. And that's kind of it. Like there's no next thing to look forward to.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1048s)

It's just my opinion, Andrea. Okay, like that perfectly explains a feeling of sadness, depression, and unhappiness. The Brethren life for women ends after childbirth. They have no more expectation of anything other than rearing the kids and taking care of the house. That is disgusting to not allow anything else. They don't even allow these women to wear pants. And sorry, it's just, it's not.

I wanted to point out for the listeners what, because you spoke earlier about a break and what a break is. So the women in the church are forced to cook massive meals pretty much every weekend for other Brethren members to come over. And they have to be to an insanely high standard. The alcohol has to be high standard. If the person coming wants to drink scotch, there has to be good scotch. There has to be high-end food.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1105s)

A break is something you can invite people to your house for dinner, like I would invite you and Lane to my house for dinner. That's private inviting, they call it, and a break is where the people of the meeting decide who you have. So there's certain people that will say, "You are having a break this weekend." You don't get asked, "Would you like to have one?" You just get told you are having one, and you get told who you are having. And that is, they explain it as, so there's no preference and prejudice, right? You just accept who you have, you love all the Brethren equally.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1135s)

But really, what that is, is not being able to choose your friends, right? You're not allowed to, you're not allowed to have certain friends over other friends. No special friendships.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1147s)

No special friends. Everyone does it anyway, just on Sunday evening, but yeah, this is this one little time where you pretend you don't, right?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1153s)

What it means is, let's say you have a falling out with another Brethren member, like a business falling out maybe, or a personal falling out. That doesn't fucking matter to the Brethren. They're still gonna place these people at your house. Yep.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1166s)

There's no choice. The choice is removed from you, right? That's the difficult part, is the choices are removed from you.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1176s)

And sometimes people can't afford to do them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1179s)

Exactly.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1180s)

They're expensive. You've got a big snack tray, you've got, you know, everything on the snack tray, like nuts, cheese, meat, crackers, chips, dip, sweets, like candy. And then you've got a joint of meat which can cost you up to 50 euros, sometimes 100 euros if you're really flashy. You've got your potatoes, you've got your two side dishes, bread, salad, dessert, cheese, all must be served and cooked while in Lord's Day clothes. Sunday, I've got to get that word out of my system.

But it's a lot of pressure and sometimes [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1210s) don't feel able to do it. You can't afford it, you've had a bad week, you know, there's something going on in the house or there's some construction, but you're expected to do it. And we're supposed to look forward to it and think it's a privilege as well. Like, you don't show what you don't, I was saying to Lane today on the phone, like you don't ever really say what you want to say. You just say what people want to hear.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1232s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1233s)

So you are a robot. Every feeling that's true inside your heart is suppressed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1238s)

And that is so important for the listeners and viewers to understand about the females, especially the females. It was something that I still struggle with. I'm a people pleaser, right? And you always got to be able to check, it's being able to train yourself to check in with, "Is this really what I think? Is this really what I feel? Am I just trying to please the people around me? Am I trying to make everything peaceful?" Or, you know, is it really what I feel? So it is, that's just stripped [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1269s) of you, especially the females. It's just stripped out of you because you have to become this robot, right?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1275s)

Yeah, and you might be having a bad day or a bad week where you don't want to answer your phone or you don't want to answer your text or you don't want to go work at Campus\&Co. It doesn't really matter. You've got to perform. Campus\&Co. is the Brethren's grocery store, which all the sisters are expected to volunteer at willingly and happily and for no pay. And I have boycotted it and not gone since January.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1297s)

Good for you. They literally, this cult literally tries to make, or does make, all its members buy groceries from their own grocery store so that they can get like a better deal and make some money back for the churches that indoctrinate them into believing all sorts of crazy shit. So my question is, what is the difference between a vegetable in a regular grocery store and a vegetable in the Brethren grocery store? Does it have less sin on [it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1327s)

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1328s)

It's more expensive.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1329s)

Oh\! So Bruce Hales, one of the richest people probably in Australia, doesn't seem to have enough money. Why is it? Why can God create anything except money?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1348s)

Yeah, and when you go there, like, I actually enjoyed the work I did. I really enjoyed it. It was a challenge and you, you know, you learn something and you've got something to do with your hands other than being at home, which is a nice distraction, which is why the sisters like it, because it gives us a new challenge. But you start to hear gossip, you know, "She comes to the shop, but she doesn't work there," or "She works at the shop, but she won't shop there," or "She didn't buy very much this week," or "Their family doesn't come to the special events that they throw on Saturday." And it's just, yes, it's a grocery store and yes, it is something to do, but it's just a breeding ground for gossip and judgment. It is.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1387s)

Yeah, the fact they don't pay their workers should be illegal.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1389s)

Exactly. And the fact that we're not allowed to have a paying job, they should pay us. And there has been people that have asked for it and it's been said there's no way to figure it out so that it could be fair.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1403s)

Oh yeah, there's just too much money coming in. We don't know what to do with all this money. I'm sorry, we can't pay these workers. Why? Because they're females. Let's get that into your head. 2023 right now, and there's a cult internationally that won't pay women, won't pay them to work.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1424s)

And we're not allowed to ask to be paid because it's too embarrassing and everyone would know and everyone would talk about it. So no one asks. Every single day on your phone, on multiple chats, you get marketing, you get gentle reminders to help to work at the shop, you get gentle reminders to buy this and that, the next thing at the shop, and it's becoming like everything.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1443s)

That's spam. That's not gentle reminders, that's spam. They're spamming the shit out of people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1449s)

So that's what I wanted to get into. Like right now, you're in this very, very, wow, one foot out, one foot in. And the one foot in has to show that you're one foot in. Like it's got to show you're all in there, but at the same time you're preparing for this exit. Like how does that, can you, how does that feel? Like that's got to be such an immense amount of energy taking up, of trying to make sure that all my [I's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1479s) are dotted and my T's are crossed over here, but I've got to prepare for this. Like how are you coping?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1485s)

Yeah, I'm amazed I haven't slipped up and told someone something they shouldn't at this point, quite honestly. Because yeah, you have to be prepared. At home, you're safe, right? But when your phone pings, you have to be prepared to answer what that person wants to hear in a right mood. Because if anybody smells anything, they just go and raise an alarm bell or they ask you, "Are you doing okay today?" or "Haven't heard from you for a while," or they might start to ask you out for a coffee if they're concerned.

And I'm like, okay, I want to go for a coffee with them because I'm not going to be able to see them soon, or they're going to look at me like I'm an apostate soon. Yeah. But then am I going to be able to [perform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1522s) for this person? Am I going to be able to show her that I love her and say all the right things so that she doesn't think anything's up with me? Like it's really hard to manage.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1533s)

It's a game that you have to play. Yeah, and I commend you for how well you're playing it. But, you know, it reminds me of a time and era when people were in communist Russia, and they all ratted on each other all the time. They were, that's what they had to do. Anyone could be a spy for the state, right? So they would always just be repeating the same shit. And they would rat on each other for absolutely anything. And I'm not saying the Brethren are like [communists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1563s), but I'm saying that mentality of checking up on everyone is not actual concern for your well-being, it's to see if there's any drama going.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1572s)

Yeah, yeah. They think it is. I've had someone else that's, you know, on the outside that's left and she was told, "We don't understand why you don't see the care and compassion that was shown to you." And the thing is, like, they genuinely think this is the most caring, compassionate community. And yes, there is some care and compassion in here, absolutely. But it's all conditional.

Absolutely. It's all conditional and underlying it, we're all just watching each other. I mean, I don't really care what they do, but you know you're being watched. Everything you do is being watched. When you walk into a church meeting, if you're at the church meeting, what are you wearing? What are your kids wearing? How are they behaving? How are you behaving? Are you opening the scriptures to the right page? Are you listening? Do you look sad? Do you look happy? Are you talking? Are you whispering to someone in the meeting?

And then when you get up, who do you talk to? Do you go to your car too quick? [Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1626s) you stay too long and talk? It's mentally, physically, and emotionally draining. And yet, on the other side, you love these people. Yeah, 95, 99 percent of them haven't done anything personally to you and they're generally good people at heart. And you know, we know we're gonna hurt a lot of people. It's not personal, but you're sitting in meeting and you love these [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1656s), you don't hate them. You don't have anything against them.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1658s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1659s)

But just the things that come out of their mouths, you don't agree with.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1663s)

The problem is they don't know any better, right? And they don't realize that actual love and compassion doesn't come with a set of judgments. "I will love you as long as you're in the Brethren. I will stay in contact with you as long as you're in the Brethren. I will hang out with you as long as you're in the Brethren," right? There's always that attached to every piece of their love. Their love and compassion is only based on conditions of you being of the same mind and the same beliefs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1692s)

No, I was just going to say that that's the hard part when it comes to leaving. Because we, you know, I remember with my family, like, I mean, I loved my parents dearly. I love my sisters and my brothers dearly. And it's as soon as, you don't realize how hurtful they can be until you leave. And it's such a hard pill to swallow. I remember the day that I phoned my parents to say that I wasn't coming home and my dad hung up on me. Well, my dad was just never like that, [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1722s)?

Like, it's just, and I watched some of the other people, the recent leavers that have left, and seeing how their family treats them. And it's just such a hard pill to swallow when in there you've got this tight-knit family. But then as soon as you step outside of the box and outside of the fellowship, so they call it, outside of the church, all of a sudden it's just this complete and utter, complete different family that's coming at you. They turn on you. Yeah, they do. They turn on you. How [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1752s) you overcoming the fear of doing this?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1758s)

With time. I've learned to just let go of the fear because I've realized I have to put me and my husband and children first. We deserve to have a happy life, a really happy life. I've spent long enough feeling like my heart hurts.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1778s)

And you just simplify your life, right? You think of leaving is just going to simplify everything for you. It's such a simpler life because you have this choice to just, if you want to have hot dogs for supper and do it in your pajamas, you get to, right? Absolutely.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1795s)

And your friends won't judge you based on your faith, right? Or what you do or how you dress. They're just going to love you for who you are. That's the beauty of the world. You get to choose your friends.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1807s)

Friends.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1808s)

Yeah. They say the opposite of what it actually is, right? They say you'll get broke. So what? I would rather be broke in the world knowing that there's loving, compassionate people around me than going back to prison and being rich.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1823s)

And knowing you can be your authentic self doing so.

You know, I'm 36, soon to be 37\. That's half my life. I think I want to relive the last half of my life and hopefully longer, happy. It's not like I haven't really tried to give this a good shot, being a good Brethren wife, you know? And there were times I was happy and I didn't think about anything else. I don't know if I could leave on my own. I'm really grateful I've got Lyle with me and the kids. We'll have our own family unit. I mean, what do you need beyond that than a few, two or three good friends and all of you all that have created this landing pad for us.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1861s)

But It is a wild journey of learning to let go of the fear.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1867s)

They instill that fear, right? That like, the things that you want are bad for some reason, right? Your own desires are evil. You're supposed to only follow desires of Bruce Hales and God because then what happens is you condition the mind to associate fear with pleasure, right? And the things that you desire and you want to do that will make you happy, because people get happy when they do the things they want to do, you'll feel guilty for it. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1897s) what the Brethren try and condition the mind to do. And when you get over that and you start realizing how amazing it is and you're like, "I just went to the bar, I just went to the movies and I didn't feel guilty. It was actually a good movie."

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1911s)

You're like, "Oh my goodness." Like, I was a clone. I don't want to be a clone. Some people are happy doing that. And I don't mean that mentally, I just mean in the way we're all supposed to perform the same. And for somebody, I have seen the world. I was out for three years. I know what it's like. Maybe inside that's why there has been things that I just cannot accept. And even though I'll try and I will live with it, it's that cognitive dissonance. I just know I don't agree with it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1938s)

It was your subconscious telling you because you'd seen through the veil before, right? Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1943s)

When Lyle and me were first talking about it, like we were like, maybe someday...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1948s)

You tried it with all your heart. I know you've told me that before, how you tried to play by the rules and instead of making you happy, which according to their rules it should, everything should be fine, instead it was, you had to suppress your true self.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1965s)

Yeah, and it really is not fun and feeling miserable. It really isn't. And you're always trying to overcome that every day, every minute. Just enjoy the moment or enjoy a phone call with someone that you love. It's hard living like that. It's exhausting. Once we both started talking about this, my biggest thing was I said I don't want to leave my mom behind. I'm super, super close with her. And if she ever watches this one day, it's probably going to break her heart.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=1996s)

But even if your mom does listen to this, Andrea, she will know that this was never done out of hatred. This wasn't done out of a weird sin thing getting in. This was done out of love for your husband, yourself, and your daughters. And that is amazing because it's not easy what you're going through.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2015s)

I just felt like I was gonna die if I stayed in there. I couldn't cope with it. I just couldn't cope.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2020s)

And so many people use those words, right? Those seem to be the words that we get to that we use right before we leave, that it comes to a do or die situation, right? And I mean, you've got two beautiful girls that you know that you've got, I mean, you've expressed that. You've expressed that to me even, how you've got to give, you know, you need to give them a better life, right? I don't want them to feel like me.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2044s)

Yeah, I'm so terrified they'll feel as deeply unhappy and trapped as me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2051s)

And not be able to do anything about it, right? Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2054s)

You're giving them freedom, Andrea, freedom. They can choose now what they want to do in life. If your daughters want to be world travelers or a doctor, a lawyer, a dentist, there's so many things that they can do. They do not have to just be a mother that works at a non-paying grocery store. You're giving them life. And that is a beautiful, beautiful thing you're doing.

I know it's in a way, we do break our family's hearts and stuff when we leave and we do this. But it's not [us.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2084s) It's them that breaks their own heart because they go, "Oh, now I can't speak to them. Now I can't call them. Now I can't talk to them. Now I can't listen to what they say because they say these terrible things." It's them doing that to themselves.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2098s)

They're cutting off from us.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2100s)

Yes.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2101s)

No, I don't have anything against any individual. I just want to be happy for me and I can't do that in there. That's what it really boils down to, as simple as that.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2110s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2111s)

And I had to get over that fear of hurting my mom because it held me for a while. I said, "I can't do this because I know she needs me," and it puts a lot of pressure on me. But then she's been my anchor for years, which she would be my bright spot in my day. And so I had to kind of learn to let her go so that I can live for me. Yeah. Once I came to that, I said, "Okay, I can do this." And it just went from there.

And we didn't, you know, I told Lane, "Maybe in one or two years, we'll leave." What happened is that each podcast that came out, we would be literally sitting on our phones like, "When's it going to come out?" It was our lifeline because it wasn't telling us how to feel. It was confirming how we felt.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2161s)

Yes. That is the beautiful thing about people sharing their stories, is we're not sitting here telling someone how to feel. It is such a healing way to bring up this stuff and get it through, to do it on a podcast. But it also, because it reaches other people that they're going to find themselves in that. You know, like they find, everybody finds themselves in every story.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2186s)

And those other people have been brave enough to open themselves up. And what you do is you hear someone saying, "Oh, I feel like that too." You know, Stephen Gear's story, when he said he was so deeply unhappy but he loved his wife, that really, that was like, "Yes, that is exactly how I feel." It's not, the two are not the same thing at all. Yeah. Once you see through the bullshit, you can't unsee it. Exactly. The veil is lifted. It is off. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2217s)

And every time we went to meeting and every time we were around people, we just got more and more assured, like, "We don't agree with this. We don't agree with this." And then we said, yeah, we're not, I don't know when it was, like probably the end of February, we said we're not putting our kid back in OneSchool Global in September. That's the Brethren school. And every single week something would happen in our plan, and our plan just became that we're leaving on June 23, 2023\.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2255s)

That's amazing. That's amazing that you've come so far since December. Because I'll tell you, I knew, okay, when you talked to me and you were like, "I'll never leave," and in my head I said, "You know, for sure, maybe." And then I talked to you more, right? And it was, "Well, maybe in a couple years," you know? And I didn't fight back on that. I didn't tell you no. I just, but I knew in my [head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2285s), there's nothing loving about sitting through a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church meeting.

There's no love and compassion. They can say it as much as they want, but it doesn't make it true. They don't know how to love. And the fact that your body, your physiology, everything rejected it once you knew the truth. What we're doing here on this podcast and these stories are the truth. If they were lies, we'd be in jail by now for false accusations. But we're not because all these stories are true. And [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2316s) they hurt so much to hear the truth is because, like Andrea says, it's been lying in you. You know, right? It just confirms what you already knew deep in your heart.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2327s)

I was just saying, people can only live so long with conditional love, right? It stifles you. Yes. The soul searches for unconditional love. We want to be fully loved with no conditions, right? It's learning how to love ourself like that, but it's also being receiving that, right? There's how many billions of people on this planet? It's all what we search for.

We're searching how to be amongst other humans and to love one another unconditionally. That's, you know, not in any way, shape or form betraying anybody else's beliefs or betraying your beliefs, but to have a group of humans all living together, doesn't matter what they believe, doesn't matter their skin color, doesn't matter their sexual orientation. But a [soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2376s) ultimately wants to just love everyone around them regardless of what they put on themselves on this planet, right? That's what we search for, for who they are. Exactly. You just want to be accepted, and in the PBCC, you cannot get that.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2395s)

You can't get that. Yeah. I've done little things like, you know, you might wear a bracelet to the meeting and you kind of know it's going to make people talk about you, but you just want to do something just for you. And it sounds little, but it's those kinds of little things. "Did you see her handbag? It's this brand," and "Or did you see her skirt? It's a bit too short." It's this is that, the system of care and compassion. "Oh my goodness, Luke is sitting on the front row. He didn't make remark tonight," or "He made two remarks tonight." And "Why does his little [boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2425s) have shorts on?" And so petty and never-ending. And when your brain just wants to think of bigger things, you just get so, it's so boring. And yet some people are happy in there and that is fine. But as you say, Cheryl, we all have to be happy in our own. And some of us are not meant, yeah, to be like that. Oh, so sorry. You said some people cannot be brainwashed. That's what you said. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2451s)

Okay, go ahead.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2452s)

You were going to read something? Yeah, I just found, I found my notes. It was like basically this part of me has been dormant since I came back. And it was April 2008, actually, two weeks before Lane was shut up. I think we had one meeting together. Yeah. And just looking back at it now, it was dormant in me. We started talking about leaving, Lyle and me, and I started telling him things I have never told him. We've been married for 12 years. He didn't know there were so many things I never told him because I just shut those three years off from my life. I had to, I had to just move on. And there were things that were fun that I wanted to tell him. I just never did tell him because...

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2494s)

You thought they were wrong.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2496s)

Well, you just don't want to talk about that part of your life because you don't want people to judge you.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2501s)

Well, you were saying how you think that those thoughts were just dormant in you. And I remember you telling me on a phone call, because I talked about something, I don't remember exactly what, but you said, "Lane, I've never even allowed myself to have those thoughts." And that shocked me. That shocked me. The level that they get into someone's mind to not allow them to think certain thoughts, right? To not even barely have the freedom to allow a thought because the Brethren [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2531s) call that a doubt. No, it's called thinking, and they don't want you to do it because you'll realize that the system is bullshit.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2540s)

"I'll do the thinking and you do the doing."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2543s)

That's disgusting.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2545s)

If that ain't a brainwash statement, I don't know what is. And that's a statement that Bruce Hales says, right? Yeah. And we've been told recently in the meetings, because I tell you, there is so much in the meetings right now about fear and the attacks against our brother, and "You should not be taken in by them." And the latest quote is, "We don't understand these attacks, but we just be prayerful. You don't need to understand the attacks." Like basically, "Don't go on the internet and google them because you might find out the truth."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2572s)

But what's funny is there's always a certain percentage of people that when they're told, "Do not look this up," they're gonna go google, google, google right away.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2582s)

But I mean, we've seen in the past with leaders, right? We've seen in the past with leaders that the more that the truth comes out, the more the fear tactics come out, right? And we've had so many reports from inside of how fearful Bruce is getting and how angry he is getting with his deliveries of speech and you know, what he's portraying right now. And I mean, it's sad. It really is sad because he has the power.

[He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2613s) has the power, like he holds this power key to sit down and be like, "You know what? Hey, let's stop. Let's just stop. And let's look at each individual case that's been brought forward. And let's deal with this." Like somebody with compassion, right? Like I wouldn't, I don't care if it's even my worst enemy. But if I heard a horrible story about somebody, I would look into it. I'd be like, "How can we go and help this person?" Like, that's just what I don't get from him. Bruce is so black and white. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2643s) good and evil, right? And if you're not doing what he's doing, you're evil.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2648s)

Right. And yet, why is there 56 or 58 podcasts of people wanting their stories heard by him and have mostly tried to get in touch with him for help and there hasn't been anything back?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2660s)

What is your plan on leaving? Are you leaving behind a letter? Are you sending, are you addressing anything to Bruce? Like, are you addressing a letter to Bruce? No, you're just leaving.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2670s)

We're just gonna send a letter to our, just "Hello all," and not too much information or reason because we think the less you give them, the less they know and the less they can gossip about. I've been out before and I have heard what they said about me. I have been sucked into all the traps, yeah, and I refuse to do it again.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2689s)

I remember when I was confined and I was moving out of my parents' house and my dad and mum were bawling. They'd got me an apartment and stuff. And I remember one of the last things I ever said to my mom was, "Don't you ever pretend I'm dead." I said, "Don't you treat me like how Gordon and Betty treated Andrea when she was out." They said the nastiest things during those three years and I was seeing you all the time, right?

I got caught one time. [Andrea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2720s) picked me up in her car and I had just, I snuck out of the house all the time, right? And I'm like 15 years old. Andrea picks me up around the block. And you turn a corner, and there's my dad on a bicycle right across. And he stops, looks in the car, and catches both of us. Oh, I was in so much trouble. It's the sick things that they say. They'll just turn on you, right? And that's not right.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2747s)

We're going to get a lot more pressure because we're taking our kids. And to them, that is the ultimate betrayal to the church, right? Because it's the potential. It's the potential for the church. And yet, you know what? I have seen my children blossom in the past six months because I have changed my way of thinking. I have changed my way of mothering. I have changed my way of communicating with them.

I just found it in a note here. And this is the end of January. So I'd been probably changing my way of thinking for a couple weeks. And the girls are both happier. I'm able to give them more time and fun. I'm not parenting them based on someone else's schedule.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2786s)

Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2788s)

Like it...

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2790s)

Only took a few weeks. Just my mind has shifted. I'm not living in fear for someone else. I am done caring what other people think about me. The fear is gone.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2802s)

You want to live for yourself, Andrea, and that's amazing. It's amazing. And honestly, if your family ever wants to know why, now they can see why. They can hear exactly why. They can listen to the podcasts of you and all of the other people and hear why, right? But will they do that? I don't know. But they have the answer. You've given the answer by doing this today.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2831s)

And that they don't think it's been easy for me. It has nearly killed me. You have these two sides. One is so happy that you're going to have your own life, you're going to be free. But you are torn every day, every time your phone pings, every time the phone rings. You know you are going to literally stab a knife in the heart of each one of your family, and I love them all. Absolutely. It kills me.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2860s)

But Andrea, what you do by doing this, you have no idea how many people you might reach, how many people looked up to you, how many little boys and girls that knew your daughters or that know you so well now, they're going to listen. And you have no idea how many lives you might help just by doing what you're doing. Seriously.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2886s)

And it just opens up a path. You got to think that you literally are going to the door and you are the brave one in your family to show them, because right now they don't see this door. You are showing them that here's the door, here's how you can do it. I mean, you're trying to do it in the least controversial way possible, right? And you literally are flagging this door. It could even be your parents, it could be siblings, it could be nieces, it could be nephews.

It could [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2916s) anybody down the road now knows where this door is because you showed them where it was and walked through it. Right. That is the most powerful thing about standing up for who you are and making a choice of action and following through with it, is we then now give someone permission behind us to say, "Hey, well, I knew her very well. Maybe she was a part of my family. Maybe it was my mother. Maybe it was my father." You've now shown them that it's possible.

[Yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2946s) At the beginning, it's messy. It's always messy at the beginning because it's change. Change is messy on this planet. I don't know of any kind of change that there is that never has some sort of messiness or consequences to it, right?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2960s)

Absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2961s)

There's just consequences to change, whether that be all positive or all negative, doesn't matter. But there's always a ripple effect of when you're, especially when you're making a generational systemic change in your lifestyle. Like you literally are cutting it off and saying, "I no longer am going to allow this."

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=2979s)

No, and I don't want my children to be miserable and I don't want to be miserable and I don't want my husband to be miserable. Like I have said this multiple times to my husband over the past few years, I was so frantic for a mental break. My option out, and some of my friends know this as well, I would just say I'm to go into the, as they call it in Germany, a nerve clinic.

If I just could, I was on antidepressants for a couple years, [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3010s), '15. And I just remember this lady said to me, the little therapist that I could speak to, she said to me, "You're like a bird in the cage. You need to get away and go on a cruise with your husband or something." And I said, "No, I can't do that." But she said to me, "If you ever feel like you need somewhere to go, you can always check yourself in." And I've held that thought in my head for nine years.

So that is the only thing that I thought I could do to get a break because I did not understand why I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3040s) so frantically unhappy. Yeah, like, and that's not a way to live. You've got one life to live. Why live it in misery? Yeah. Like this, this change is terrifying. You know, we haven't even done it. Tomorrow morning, we're going to go to a meeting.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3054s)

And your strength for coming on here while you're still in is mind-blowing and amazing. It's like taking, like, I'm scared of snakes, okay? I'm gonna hold 10 snakes right now. That's literally like what you're doing. My whole body is shaking from head to toe.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3071s)

I bet it is.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3073s)

And because of you, because of you, maybe we'll have more people on the inside that want to come on and talk, right? You're opening so many doors. What you're doing is amazing.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3084s)

We know that we are going to cause a massive volcano explosion in this meeting here because, you know how in meetings, Lane, like there is, you know, remember in Montreal there was a little group of rebel families that did what they wanted and then the rest of them were good? We're in the kind of the group of families that people know we kind of do what we want, not blatantly, but we miss meetings sometimes and we hang out with the cool crowd. We just haven't cared. We've done it five, six years.

We know, especially that crowd of people is going to be mind blown. We hope it inspires them. We hope it inspires someone else and says, "You know, they weren't crazy. They've got their heads on right. They're not acting weird. They just said, 'Bye, we're done.'" If that can help someone, then I'd be so happy.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3136s)

It will. I know it will. Yeah. And we're gonna do follow-up stories with you, hopefully, you know, in the future when you're out and we can talk about those feelings that you'll have then. There's so many things that you're gonna do and that we can do together now, you know? It's the possibilities of life have just opened up. And that's what the Brethren are missing. You know what the Brethren need more of? Time in nature. Yes, get close and you will [realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3166s) something.

I said this to Andrea earlier today on the phone. When you spend time in nature, you realize that if, and I say if because I don't think there is a creator, but if there is a creator, the creator did not spend any less time on a plant than he spent on you. You are not special. The planet is much more special than you. Insects are special, right? These little intricate things in life will bring you closer to your source, or you want to call it God, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3197s) sitting in a windowless room preaching about a fat guy that literally cares about money. And Andrea, breaking away from it is the best thing you'll ever do. Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3210s)

And even just being able to admit to myself, why have I never felt anything when I came out of the supper? Who are these people I'm sitting with? Who are they? I don't even know them. Do I like them? Seriously, our last supper is in two days. I'm so excited to go to one, only one more.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3226s)

The supper that Andrea is referring to here is the PBCC Sunday morning meeting at 6 a.m., where they have communion and believe the Lord will take them up to heaven from this gathering.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3238s)

Well, I challenge you to one last time to see if Jesus shows up.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3245s)

If I'm gone and I don't show up on June 23, then you know where I went. Okay. Maybe.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3249s)

Maybe. I think it's important to show them, and I know we've spoken about this, Andrea, but I think it's important to show them a little bit of your life sometimes when you leave to show that you're not just okay. You're not just like, "Oh, yeah, we're surviving. We're barely eating." No, no, no. We're actually happy. Because every time that you feel happy after you leave the Brethren, it contradicts their story. Every time you do good and you feel great and you're loving life, which happens to me every single day, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3280s) contradicting their bullshit.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3283s)

It's the one thing I've always wanted in life, is just to be accepted for who I am with nobody expecting something out of me. But I've had to just come to terms with it. Like, I have to live my life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3293s)

You've always got to just sit and look at your children and be like, "You know what, I'm doing this for my husband, I'm doing this for myself, I'm doing this for my children," right? I felt like that when I went and did my plea statement, right? It was just, it was one of the biggest things that I struggled with. And was even now, like sitting and talking to my lead investigator yesterday, right? We're just getting so close to certain things and I'm just like, it always goes to the back of my mind, is like, "Ah, like I know my mom's obviously kept this as a secret for how long and how it's going to, what I am pulling this out of her [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3324s) what it's going to do to her at her age." But at the same time is like, "No, truth needs to come forward. Justice needs to happen." No matter what happens to anybody around that, they are the ones that are accountable for their own part in it. Right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3340s)

Healing can't come in until the truth comes out.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3343s)

Yeah. Yeah. Like there's a fellowship meeting in our meeting in August. Yeah. So like me and my husband, we're laughing. We're like, we're cutting it pretty close. Like we've gotten reminders, "Can you please tell us how many you can have to stay overnight, please?" We've gotten like two reminders now.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3359s)

It's gonna be zero.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3361s)

Yeah. "How many breaks you're gonna have?" And "Tell us how many en suites you have," because you have to have a bedroom with an en suite for a couple now. And you know, in the room has to be a coffee maker and a kettle and tea bags. Oh yeah, oh yeah. And Wi-Fi and chocolates and a sewing kit. And every day you get fresh towels and your bed is made and your bathroom's cleaned. And you have to make their bed every day.

Yeah, like you'll go in there and take all their towels and wash them and put them back on. Like the helpers are running, like it's a five-star hotel. No, that was not like that when we were... oh no, the standard is way higher. Like one of my friends said to me, "I can't have a fellowship meeting, I can't have a couple because I have no en suite." And I was like, "So what? They will walk three steps to a bathroom. They're not going to die."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3410s)

Every couple has to have a bedroom with an en suite.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3413s)

That's the high standard.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3418s)

If you don't have an en suite, it's like, okay.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3420s)

Okay.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3422s)

These motherfuckers can't make their own beds.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3424s)

Yeah, no, they make their beds, but like the sister will, you know, the helpers will go in and get all their wet towels and take them and wash them and bring them back clean.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3433s)

Fuck, why don't we get in some hotel? That is insanity.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3436s)

I know, that's what I mean though, that the helpers run. The helpers are like usually young teens and that they come, yeah, like a couple or you'd have two, a boy and a girl, but often people would just have a couple because then the guy can help drive people around or serve drinks or whatever.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3452s)

Okay.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3452s)

You know, and I mean, yeah, we went to a fellowship meeting in February and we were cared for very well. You know, you are definitely treated very, very well. Nothing negative to say about it. But the pressure when you're the host is quite a good story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3465s)

I can't imagine. And the money.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3467s)

The money. Some people will go out and buy a whole new set of dishes and decorate their house. No, for a fellowship meeting. I had my sister, who I've been literally begging to come here for nine years, call me up and say, "Can we come this summer with our family?" For goodness sakes, could you have not done this last year? It's too late now. So I said, "Sorry, we can't have you. We have construction in our house."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3488s)

And this has caused...

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3489s)

A whole family drama. I've had nearly every single member of my family contact me and like, "Why aren't you having them?" and "Do you think you're going to be ready to have company for the fellowship meeting?" "Oh my goodness." And "I guess you would make yourself get it done if it was Mr. Hales." And I said, "No, well, no, we're not taking out a loan to finish a bathroom in a bedroom. We don't have that. We don't take out loans. We don't agree with that." "Well, I guess you would do it if it was Mr. Hales." "No, we wouldn't, actually."

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3514s)

I like that. I like that.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3517s)

It's ridiculous.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3518s)

He's not special, he's just fatter than most.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3520s)

It's ridiculous the pressure that you feel. It's okay. Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3523s)

I'm just blown away by the fact that like someone actually thought to themselves, "Hey, let's up this level of entertaining to where we give them fresh towels every day." You kidding me? Like what blows my mind is they'll never be able to be comfortable, I guess, without that level, right?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3547s)

No, but that's the Brethren's lifestyle standard is so high.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3552s)

I would be so nervous if someone left the Brethren that was used to that high standard and came to my home. I'm like, "I'm sorry, my cooking gas tank, it feels a lot way back when I was 17 and I've never refilled it." I'm like, "I don't do extravagant meals here. It's like fend for yourself pretty much every meal, every day." So how are you actually planning on executing this? Like what is, can you reveal that to us? Can you reveal how this plan [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3582s) going to happen? Are you ready for the great exit plan? I am. Okay, this isn't Strike 23, this is Exit 23\. Welcome to, dub it for anybody who wants to do it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3595s)

Exit 2023\.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3598s)

Yeah, hashtag Exit 23\. Oh my goodness. Yeah, this is, this is what I call the Andrea Chapter One. Yeah. So we are just gonna, I have gotten advice from another friend that's left and she gave me a few tips and Lane gave me a few tips and we've just been basically gathering tips of what to say and then adding our own words. We're just gonna be blunt. We're gonna send an email and state we are not [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3629s) to be part of the PBCC anymore. I'll probably send you a copy of it, Cheryl, when we send it. But we'll just be short and blunt, truly German. Not too much reason behind it because I don't feel like anybody deserves any reason and nobody deserves any information about my life and my husband's life that we don't want to share with them. And any reason you give is just going to be thrown back at you sometime and somehow and twisted and spread.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3656s)

How are you planning on integrating into the world? Like, how are you planning on, what is your plan? Walk me through Friday.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3667s)

So I'll probably wake up after not having slept all night. Yeah. And then we're going to pack and we're going to go on vacation for a week and just literally go deep into nature and shut off media. And just, chills all over me. Really just take the kids out and just start our new life as a family unit. You know, we haven't really had time to do that, even take them away on vacation and just shut off and enjoy them. There's always, you're always rushing off to a meeting or you're rushing off here, you're rushing off there.

And [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3697s) want to just have a family unit, make that their strong base and make them feel safe too. You know, they don't know what's going to hit them. We haven't told them yet. We're going to tell them sometime when we're on vacation when they start realizing that we're not going to meeting anymore.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3710s)

That we're not going to meeting anymore.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3713s)

Yeah, because so far in the past few months, we've been easing little things into the house and they've accepted it so well that we know that there will be a moment that will come that we'll tell them. Yeah. And we'll just go off grid for a week and enjoy ourselves. And then we have to come back and deal with the messages that may or may not be there. And then we will, we have summer holidays ahead of us. He'll go back to his job. He's still working for a company. He doesn't believe in cowardice and leaving. He wants to stay. He has a good job and likes it. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3743s) So.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3743s)

Remember Andrea, some of those distressing emails that most likely will come in, you don't have to read them. You could even delete them if you want, or you can save them for later. "Next year, I'll read that next year." And you don't have to respond even, you know? You can if you want, I'm not telling you either way. I'm just saying that you have the option to not have to look at their nastiness.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3769s)

Yeah. Instead, you're going to open up the ones from everybody out here that are well-congratulating you.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3774s)

Congratulating you.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3775s)

And congrats, exactly. All our true friends that have exactly reached out and loved us and accepted us for who we are, and unconditionally. I mean, honestly, I've had moments where I have been in this journey so utterly at my wit's end. And you can't write that to a Brethren friend, "I'm at my wit's end. Would you just come out and meet me for a little walk in the fields?" You don't do that kind of thing. You don't admit you're having that bad of a day. So who would I call? I would call someone who would actually answer the phone and care for me. Thank you, my unpaid therapist, Lane.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3812s)

My heart broke when you messaged me your last time at your parents' house. Oh my God. Like, Andrea, that was what a... I don't even have words for that moment in time for you. What a bittersweet moment, knowing of the choices that you had ahead of you. And then just to explain to the viewers a bit, was just that you were at your parents' house and you were realizing that this was the last time that you were going to be there.

And you know what? I still have hope. I have hope, Andrea. But I have such high hope of just one day light bulbs turning on for our parents. Maybe it'll be on their deathbed. Maybe it will be. But we're seeding these seeds of an alternate way of viewing what love should be, what family unit should be, what choice should be. And sometimes we don't collect those seeds [until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3876s) we're on our deathbed.

But these are potent, potent seeds that we need to be sowing for those moments if they choose to arise. And I have such high hope of it. I don't know, I don't think I'm being naive. I really don't. I think that we are, I think that we're being completely, I think this whole path is being laid out for us and we're just following these breadcrumbs and destiny is calling us. And this destiny that's calling us is about change. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3906s) about reform, it's about choice. It's about knowing that you deserve more, that you are worth more. And it's about lifting the females up that are inside there and letting them know that they don't need to just succumb to something that a man writes out for you. And I know that they don't think that. I know that they think that they have these lavish lifestyles because they bought into that. But for those people, those females that are in there that are having the doubts and the thoughts like you [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3936s), right? It is, there is choice. God doesn't shut off choice because I know that that's what everybody in there, that's what they tie, tie, tie themselves to, is like, it's creator, source, God, whatever it is that you believe in, does not cut us off from personal choice.

I found a note I wrote here that said,

 "I am expected to be satisfied being nothing more than a housewife and a Campus\&Co. volunteer for my whole life." 

And this is when I've got only one life to live. And I live in a world that's imagined and created by men, controlled nearly every aspect of my time. Like, literally, it sounds brutal. Like, I remember writing that out and I was just like, you know, poor me. But now I just think, actually, that was strong because I've admitted it to myself.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3983s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=3984s)

You live it. You don't dare yourself to think why you're living it or how you're living it or that you don't like it. You just don't allow yourself. It's too scary because you might start something that is like we are now, in a situation that is uncomfortable. Change is uncomfortable. It is uncomfortable. If it's not uncomfortable, how is it real good change? Exactly. Uncomfortableness isn't bad, but it means that you have to actually go through something to realize that you need to change. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4014s)

Yes.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4014s)

That's, it's been terrifying for me. I don't love change. I've coped with a lot of change in my life actually pretty well, but I don't like it. You know, and so for me to be doing this is even more scary. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4028s)

The whole world is literally waiting for you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4032s)

Yes.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4032s)

The whole world is waiting. And it's a place full of wonder, joy, and love. Not all the nastiness, unless you want to find it. Unless you go looking for all the evil stuff, then you can find. You can always find whatever you're looking for, right? And you go out in the world and the world's literally waiting for you, Andrea. All these people, all ex-members, people that you can't even imagine because you've never met yet. They're all waiting and here to accept you for who you are and you have an [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4063s) life ahead of you. Nothing but amazingness ahead.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4067s)

The world is waiting for your children. That's what breaks my heart in this, after talking to so many OneSchool Global teachers and principals and stuff that I've, like these heart to hearts that they've had with students thinking that, you know, they wanted to be a lawyer, one wanted to be a vet, one being doctor. Like I think about how many geniuses that are in there stifled into working into a business and just making money when they have these creative sparks of, you know, we could have the next [doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4097s) scientist in there that could have a breakthrough in something and it's stuck inside there. Yeah, or like cancer research or something the world really needs. Yeah, exactly. There could be some scientist in there that could break through, you know, that could break through one of the obstacles we have on this planet and they're stuck.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4115s)

Or like in and off they go to be a secretary, you know? And it's crazy. And you know, even people that I've reconnected with after however many years, my own brother, to reconnect with, and there's no judgment. Like, "What have you been doing? Why have you not talked to me for this many years?" It's just, "Oh my goodness, how are you? This is amazing. I love you. Let's reconnect." It's heart-melting. And you know, he would probably have every reason to be mad at me that I didn't contact him all [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4146s) years.

But there's just love. We found that with so many people that we've newly met or reconnected with and you think, "This is all I need." You know, it's just me, my kids, my friends, nature, yes, life. And I can, you know, yes, I'm in another country with another language, but I have never thought about how exciting it would be to get a job here or make friends here. Oh, I haven't even properly explored where I live, right, to a point. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4176s) So it's, it's going to be heavy at first. We've got the summer holidays to get through, which is nice because it will just be mom and kids time, right? And then hopefully by the time school starts in September, we'll be well integrated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4192s)

Yeah. What is the biggest thing you're looking forward to?

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4194s)

Just not having people think they deserve me and my information. And they don't have a right to me. Yeah. I just cannot wait to be left alone to just do what I want when I want. And to only answer to my husband. Like, just leave me alone. I suppose it's because I'm the youngest of six. I've always had like five moms and, you know, I'm a bit too nice to people sometimes. My husband says, "You know, they think they own a piece of you there. You give them too much information and they think they deserve your answer." But that's what you feel. I just feel like I've got [woodpeckers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4236s) at me all the time in the Brethren. And yet these people, they mean well. Yeah, they're not coming at you unkindly, but it is just a constant barrage. You just want to be left alone. Yeah. Anyways, that was a really negative answer, but that's what I'm looking for.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4253s)

No, it wasn't a negative answer at all. It was the answer I was expecting.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4256s)

You deserve peace of mind and you deserve to be on your time.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4261s)

You deserve time of your own.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4262s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4264s)

And for somebody who, like, only in their 36th year of life realizes they have sensitivity to sounds and all these things that you have never even gone to figure out what triggers you because you're just supposed to be your little robot and you realize you have all these issues.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4279s)

I wanted to say something to, I always like to say something to the Brethren members that are listening. Do you really, after listening to Andrea, do you really want to spend the rest of your life a boring ass Brethren member? Like, you make money, you'll get rich, you can have a nice car, as long as it's not a BMW, Mercedes or a Porsche for some reason. But my point is, Brethren members, is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4309s) literally your biggest goal in life, being a successful Brethren member? Is that the top of the line for you? Is that the biggest your imagination can go to? Is being a successful Brethren member in 50,000 people? There's more people at a fucking football game. And that's the top for you. That's your top, top goal. Wow. Think about that. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in there? But anyway, Andrea, thank you so much. Yeah, we're so grateful. You know we're here for you.

### [**Andrea McKinnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4339s)

Thank you. I don't have words. You've paved this way, you've created this landing pad and you've put out, you've shared so many stories. I mean, so many people have shared their stories on your podcast and what it's done is it's opened our eyes to what this church allows to go on behind the scenes. And it's sickening and scary and you just want to run. And you feel bad for anyone who can't see through it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4378s)

Hopefully people listening to you will now have a change of mind.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAsApflbHsE&t=4383s)

Well, thank you so much, Andrea. We'll walk you through this last week and we look forward to your next podcast for an update on the other side. Much love to everybody. Lyle and Andrea and their two daughters escaped the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church as planned on June 23rd, 2023\. They were all enjoying and thriving in their newfound peace and freedom, and especially being able to reconnect with family members.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
