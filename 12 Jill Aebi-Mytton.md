## Summary

We jump into the library of knowledge inside Jill Aebi-Mytton. She gives us an inside view to the history of growing up in the 40's and 50's in the Exclusive Brethren. She unpacks the myths of there being not much trauma in that generation and gives us a descriptive understanding of the power they used back then. She reveals her horror of why she asked to break bread. The importance of the PBCC history she shares, shows us how deep the implicit indoctrination affected that generation. Jill's journey into a psychology degree got her deep into the research of trauma that ex-members go through after leaving. She takes us though some of that research and we see through her very descriptive graphs the difference between the general population and an ex PBCC member. We get into a deep discussion on finding the right therapies and therapists. We are very curious as to what has worked for you and how did you get to a place of regulation after leaving? We are super excited to have Jill back on to discuss various therapies that have worked and what hasn't worked for ex-members.

## Transcript

### [**Announcer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=5s)

We have a couple special guests with us here today.

First of all, we have Jill Aebi-Mytton with us. She is from the UK and she's going to walk us through her journey and her encyclopedias of wisdom and knowledge she has stored inside her. And we also have a brand new special guest who's going to start co-hosting with us.

Richard, do you want to do the honours of introducing us to your little one?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=38s)

Well, everyone, this is Kiara Charlotte and she is only two days old. And I don't know quite what she's going to say, but I've no doubt she'll make some contributions as we go along.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=55s)

It's adorable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=59s)

Congratulations. Yeah. Thank you.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=62s)

Absolutely gorgeous. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=64s)

It's what we all needed. A little bundle of innocence.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=68s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=69s)

Okay, Jill, I'm going to pass the mic over to you. If you just kind of want to introduce yourself and let the listeners know where you're from, your background, kind of a little bit about your story, and how have you got kind of where you are today? And then we'll kind of jump around in all the different kind of little categories that we want to talk about.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=92s)

Okay, how long have you got?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=94s)

Well, you can come back as many times as you want. So, whatever we can cover.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=100s)

After your induction, the imposter syndrome hit, because I'm not sure that I'm an encyclopedia of wisdom but there we go.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=108s)

I guarantee you are. I've had many conversations with you. You are an encyclopedia of wisdom.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=116s)

Okay so my name when I was born was not Jill Aebi-Mytton. It was Elizabeth Jill Mytton but my mother always called me Jill so that's how I remained and then I married a Swiss guy and got called Jill Aebi. So who am I? I don't know. I'm either Jill Aebi, Jill Mytton, Jill Aebi-Mytton, take your pick or in the hospital I'm usually Elizabeth Aebi because they can't say my surname but there we go.

I live now, six months ago I moved into a little village about 30 miles south of London. It's very dark out there tonight because they don't have street lights which is great. A little bit scary when you have to go out.

So, like all of us, I was born into the Exclusive Brethren a very long time ago.

I didn't choose to leave. That was my parents' decision. They decided to leave when I had just had my 16th birthday. Oh, wow. Yeah. So I've just gone into the, what we call the advanced level years at school, the last two years when we end up with advanced level certificates.

So that was, and even as I'm talking about it now, I can feel my body is reacting because that was a very traumatic incident really.

Back in those days, I mean I was brought up in the 40s and 50s, so a lot of people looking back think, oh yeah, that was before it got crazy. To some extent this is true, however something I came across which I'm going to try and share if I can, it's a quote that I used in my thesis actually, I think it's that one.

I might need to make it a bit bigger. Can you, oh no, that's, yes, can you see that? Yeah\! Yeah, so we see on every side wives refusing to pray with her husbands. This is from 1877\.

Brothers estranged from brothers, daughters leaving pious and loving parents to lead a life apart, close and happy ties of friendship and affection severed. The persons in question have been led to believe that that course of action is the path of duty and obedience to God. So that was said in 1877\.

That's a long time ago. And I think we need to remember that whilst we know all about things now, that's partly because we have the internet, we have telephones, we have newspapers all around us. Whereas, of course, back then, anything that happened was just passed around by word of mouth. And it was very much the same, actually, when I was a kid. We didn't hear very much about anyone else, any of the other localities, if you like.

So, while stories from people pre-1960 are not full of shock horror type stories, you know, the dreadful sexual abuse that we hear about now, and so on. The thing is, we don't know what was happening. We don't know what was going on. Yeah, where I lived, it was very much like the little local community. And that's all you knew. So friendships, for example, were tricky because I was the only [girl.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=327s) There was one other girl, but we didn't get on very well. So that was kind of a bit limiting.

I think in the 40s and 50s the whole environment in the Brethren was much more nuanced and implicit rather than explicit.

So we grew up not really knowing what the rules were. We had to sort of second guess them and that kind of brought problems of its own because there was a feeling of uncertainty around and I don't actually remember an awful lot of my childhood. I've been told by a therapist that probably it's because I was dissociated most of the time. I guess your listeners know what dissociation is? I'm pretty sure they do. Yeah, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=375s) it stops memories from being laid down in the brain so I only have little tiny cameos of things to think about.

Some of the memories I have, they're not all bad. One memory I have is of the hall on a Sunday morning, we used to call the meeting rooms then, I'm not sure if they still are, and the sun is shining through the windows because they still had windows then and I could hear the church bells of the church just up the road and it was very peaceful, a very peaceful sort of feeling until the church bell stopped and then I couldn't listen to them anymore I had to listen to the brethren the men [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=419s) and their words used to kind of waft over my head like a grey mist. I had no idea what they were talking about and interestingly back then as well as now it was the men on the front row and the women and children behind so that has that steeped in history. That stayed, hey? That was all the way back then. Yeah, absolutely.

I actually still have a bit of a phobia of going for an interview, especially if the men are sort of sat in front of me and they're all wearing dark suits and ties because they wore ties in those days. I still kind of slightly have a moment of freaking out.

Another memory that's not such a good one is of the gospel meetings, which weren’t every evening then it was just one gospel meeting and the preacher would talk for 45 minutes and the children then all sat because the seats were all facing in the same direction. Not in a circle but all facing the same direction towards the speaker, obviously, who was up on the platform with a big lectern in front of him and so he was above us looking down the children on the front row, and I [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=491s) remember them kind of thundering at us, talking at us all about hellfire and damnation and I just remember it being quite terrifying place to be. I remember that quite vividly.

My mother unfortunately perhaps because of a car accident they had when I was just two and a half.

You've got that image I think of me at that age standing by my mother's bed.

And I think she probably was traumatised by that event because she really should have died. Somehow she managed to survive but I think as a result she had to keep everything in control and that included us, particularly me for some reason. And she did very much take on board the brethren ethos of all or nothing, saved or sinner, right? Everything was black and white.

But she honestly believed she was doing the right thing. So I've never held that against her. But it did make it difficult.

There is one little story I remember. She'd found a book with a child's handwriting. Somebody had written in this book. And this isn't something you do, is it? You don't write in books. Goodness me. So she recognised my writing, she claims, and I remember sitting on her knee in a stool in the bathroom for some reason and she just kept going on and on and on at me until I sobbed and sobbed and said yes it was me, [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=592s) though I knew it wasn't me.

So in other words she was weaponizing guilt. Yeah.

But I never, I don't know, in later years I talked with her about some of these events and I'm pretty sure that like the rest of us she was indoctrinated by the Brethren beliefs and practices and because of her car accident as well I think she was terrified of losing any of us, losing control of us, you know, so I kind of get that.

But you know the rules, what made it so uncertain is that we never knew what we were allowed to do, you know, it was a weird situation. I'll tell you another story if you like about roller skates. My cousins were in the Open Brethren, in one of the offshoots of the main Plymouth Brethren branch, and they were having such fun. They were rolling around on these skates all around the drive down the paths and having to. And of course, I didn't have any [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=658s) I couldn't join in. You know, I comforted myself was by saying, yes, but you see, roller skates are evil. They're wicked. We shouldn't have roller skates and have fun. So even though they're having fun and I'm not, it's okay because, you know, I've seen the light, as it were. I didn't think any more about it until I was about 30 or 40, somewhere around that time. And I said to my mother one day, why did the brethren consider roller skates to be evil? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=689s) she said they don't, they never did. I don't know about now, she said, but they didn't back then. So I said, well why didn't I have any then? And she said, um you didn't ask for them so you didn't get them. But my child's brain…

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=706s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=707s)

…worked out that if I didn't have something, I didn't have it because it was evil and that's something that it's kind of an implicit indoctrination, the basic indoctrination.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=718s)

That they instill in you, right? Yeah, that's their ground level.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=722s)

Yeah, yeah and you don't even know it's happening and even in later years looking back you don't realize what it was. I honestly still thought that roller skates, the brethren considered roller skates to be evil.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=736s)

And it's almost as if if someone's enjoying something, if something's fun, then it must be evil and you end up with this sort of complex whereby if you start enjoying yourself you feel guilty because there must be something wrong, yeah, because this is supposed to be a life of suffering so…

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=754s)

Yes, exactly and of course they they weaponize that guilt don't they by, by you know telling you well you know you need to get saved you need to get right with God. We had all that as well, you know, it that wasn't something that came in with JTJr. it was there all along. And I had three mantras in my head. One was the one I can't, don't know if I'm quoting it correctly, the one about being “..born in sin and shapen in iniquity.” That was one of them.

Yeah, so I'm rotten to the core. Another one was, well I shall tell you how I remembered it. I remembered “You shall be judged and found wanting.” but that's not correct. The correct one is I think “Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=802s)

Yes.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=803s)

That's how I understood it I suppose. But then on the other side, so you've got these two negative ones, on the other side you've got, “Well done that good and faithful servant.” So I think as a child, like many of my generation perhaps, we were fearful because of these messages we were getting, because of the thundering scary preachers, they really were scary. You could almost feel them spitting at you, you know, they were so passionate about it. Um, against all of that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=833s) “Well done that good and faithful servant.” So you know, it's like I spent most of my childhood trying to be that “good and faithful servant” so that I wouldn't be judged. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=844s)

Well I'm blown away that this kind of heavy indoctrination was all the way back then. Like this is, it's good to get this out and have people from all different timelines to come forward and like really give this.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=864s)

Yeah, historically it's important we understand about history and it's important to understand how even back in the 19th century the brethren were actually preaching quite nasty things. Hell fire, brimstone, ashes, burning hell, those are very, all very graphical to a child because to a child those are not metaphorical, they're real.

They're absolutely real. Whereas to an adult they might, yeah, that won't really happen, that's not what it means, you know, or whatever however they deal with it. Um, and I imagine they still preach that, don't they? 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=906s)

Oh yeah, 100%. Yeah, I mean it came in your priestly visits, right? It was like weekly priestly visits that was all thrown on you. And I do think too, Jill, and you might find this, that I mean sometimes your interpretation, so you know, we've got these these mantras and things that you remember and maybe they were misquoted, but do you think sometimes the priest uh misrepresented what they meant to be able to hold this um hold of fear over top of the congregation that they're delivering it to, right?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=938s)

Yeah, because things would, although verses like that, mantras like that are taken out of context.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=944s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=944s)

So you don't, and as a child you don't know the context. You just hear these judgmental words and these messages that you are worthless and nothing that you do is of any value. “That's just the holy spirit working through you.” Which is another one. So you can't even take credit for something you've done well, you know, because it's, you don't do holy. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=970s)

Yeah. So I think it's very important that you're pointing up the damage that is done to even very young children. And what goes along with that is the other thing that you pointed up in your thesis and in your work is that the brethren is very much a generational cult. It's not the kind of cult that people get pulled into at an adult age where they [have,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1000s) you know, maybe by a deceptive process, but voluntarily join. We didn't ask for this. And yet we end up passing it on to our children. And one of the things that makes me very happy is that this child here is breaking that generational curse. I mean, I was born into it, my father was born into it, my grandfather, my great-grandfather probably, but this child is born [free.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1031s) She's not going to be submitted to that evil control.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1035s)

She may well still have some leftovers from you because you were born into it. It's like my two daughters. I mean, they're very well aware of what I do and why I'm doing it and all the rest of it. But it has taken me away from them at times. I'm pretty sure of that. And the struggles with my mental health during the first 10 or 15 years of their life as well. You know, it was not easy for them. Um, so yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1065s)

And they talk about that in research about it taking seven generations to fully break a whole like a complete tie of the remnants emotionally and mentally um to be completely free of them. It takes like things like that those seven generations to completely dissolve all of that trauma through the generation.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1084s)

Sounds like a lot of generations, doesn't it? Yeah.I guess it could take a few.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1090s)

But you think of like the things that are seated in us, right? Like I mean I find myself many things that I've passed on to my children, right, that I don't even, you know, I can't help myself but pass on some of these fears to my children. They just change their form, right? They change how they're presented to the children, right? I mean the biggest blessing is that they're not in that indoctrination every day. The biggest blessing, right Richard, is that…

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1116s)

Oh yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1117s)

…we are not inside this indoctrination seven days a week, right? And our job now is to be able to sit back and be able to, you know, and this is why I really wanted you on here, Jill, is like not at all our listeners know exactly where you've gone inside your work but your research, your, I mean, the conversations when I sit down and have a conversation with you, it's just so fulfilling and I know you don't really see yourself like that because you've just lived it but you you've got this [wealth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1147s) of information and knowledge when it comes to mental health, when it comes to emotional regulation, um that you've just got sought out, gone and sought out to be able to help with all of the trauma that's left behind once you leave because that is a huge taking on.

I mean most people stuff it away, zip it up and pretend it never happened and try and move forward and a [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1177s) of the ex-members that I'm in touch with now as we're we're getting a bunch of things going here in Canada and having to dig up some stuff, um it's hard for them. It's hard for them to go back in and unzip that because in their mind they're done with it.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1194s)

But absolutely. It reminds me, sorry, it reminds me of World War II veterans. A lot of them didn't have PTSD at the end of the war. 50 years later when we had some kind of commemoration here in London, a whole bunch of them developed PTSD because for 50 years they'd used all their coping mechanisms to keep it all at bay. Yeah, that happened then, I'm a free man now, look what I've done for my country. Yeah. I have stiff upper lip and all [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1224s) rest of it. But with the commemorations with Vera Lynn recordings being played everywhere and the arc lights over London and the fireworks and stuff going off, an awful lot of them became extremely distressed and of course by then they were quite quite elderly people and it becomes more difficult to face your demons, if you like, when when you're older. So I think a lot of people when they leave these cultic groups they do lock it away and I know we're going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1254s) talk about PTSD in a moment but it is actually important to think about PTSD and the symptoms. The question is, are they symptoms or are they coping mechanisms?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1266s)

That's a very good point.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1270s)

Perhaps we'll come to that later. There was one other thing I wanted to say about being raised in the 40s and 50s, and that was that we had to ask to break bread.

And until you did you weren't a full member although you were treated as such. So we had to ask to break bread. So a lot of the preachings on a Sunday evening would be straight at the young people that sort of 12, 13, 14 year olds putting a lot of pressure on them to ask to break bread. And that is one memory that I have, one of the few because what I remember one Sunday evening, I guess I was about 13 or [14,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1314s) the pressure became too much. I got absolutely panicked inside because I thought if I don't ask to break bread now, it's not going to happen and I'll go to hell. That was my thinking. Not, oh yes, I want to commit my life to the Lord, but I need to ask as if I don't, I'll go to hell. I mean, that's not a reason to ask to break bread. And I was in bed and I was crying and sobbing and just didn't know what to do and I called my father and he came in and I said and I said to him I want to break bread, can I ask to break bread? And he sort of comforted me a bit but he told me later that he couldn't understand why I was so upset and it bothered him that I was so upset because he said you should have been [happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1360s) because you're committing yourself to the Lord but you weren't happy, you were distressed and scared. 

But of course because I had asked, he had to pass it on to the brethren and that's another reason why I don't like sitting in front of a group of dark suited gentlemen because three or four of them came around, we didn't call them priests in those days, they were just brothers, yeah, brothers in the Lord. And they came around and sat down with me, my parents weren't with me, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1390s) should have been really because at 13 you're still a you're still a what you call it, um a child.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1396s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1397s)

Um, and I the only question I remember from all the questions they asked me was do you believe in the doctrine of the token?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1407s)

Wow.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1411s)

The obvious answer that I had to give was yes. I hadn't got a clue what they were talking about, not a clue. Oh my gosh. You know, do you understand the doctrine of the token, Cheryl, do you? I'm just shocked.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1427s)

Walk us through. I I'm just blown away here. It like walk us through how, so did you have to ask this every week or was it just once a time? 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1438s)

You ask it once, your parent then takes it to the brethren, the brethren come and see you and then they have a care meeting to decide whether or not Jill can be, you know, take part in the breaking of bread. I had no clue it worked like that. That is just, that was pretty scary for a 13 year old. Yeah, of course it would be, absolutely terrifying. But you know, I thought, well I have to ask. And if you talk to some of the others, [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1468s) people of my generation, I'll tell you the same similar story.

 And you, but you know what really irked me, having got over the terror and oh I've been accepted, I thought it's going to be my big day on Sunday, I'm going to be the new one on the block, you know. To my horror, the other girl that I mentioned earlier, that the only other girl in our meeting, decided to do exactly the same thing. So there were two of us. And I felt that my moment of glory had been stolen, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1498s)

So when they asked you if you believed in the doctrine of the token, do you believe that that was, do you believe in what we were doing?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1507s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1508s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1509s)

Yeah, that's what I mean. The doctrine of the token was very much a thing at that time, I think.

You know, this idea that women had to keep their head covered. I mean, they always did keep their head covered as far back as we know. I mean, in Victorian times, women kept their hair covered anyway. You know, Victorian women would have worn hats or scarves or something.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1534s)

I'm just shocked at the rules and indoctrination from back there. I'm like, mind blown right now.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1540s)

But as I said earlier, you know, it was quite implicit. We didn't know what the rules were. We really didn't know. I mean, we kind of knew we had to go to the meetings, but we didn't go all week. But it was weird. I somehow knew that I couldn't have friends at school. Well, how did I know that? I don't know. I don't remember being explicitly told you can't have friends at school.

It was just implicit. I knew that um all the kids, the girls around me, it was a girl school, um, were having fun. They had boyfriends that they would talk about and they're having parties. They went to the cinema. The pop music was emerging on the scene so they were all into that. They were giggling over girly things in the corner of the playground and I was just shut out from it. And I remember another little cameo. One day in the playground at school, I went up to this [group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1598s) of girls and they instantly stopped talking and look at me and said, go away, you wouldn't understand.

So they knew, they knew there was something about me that was different. And that sticks, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1610s)

That's hard. I, like, I, that's one thing that I still suffer from is like the, the, going to a public school and being that different kid, such a different kid, like, I can't even imagine what you must have felt like in that moment, because there's a piece of you that just shatters.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1631s)

Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1633s)

Would it be a kind of, I mean peer pressure would be a large part of that implicit indoctrination, would it? You're not told not to do something but you sort of unconsciously model yourself on what everyone else is doing. Is that how it works partly?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1650s)

Well I think so. I mean it happens to ordinary kids as well, but the kind of things that they get pick up from their friends at school are not sort of rules and regulations so much as you know I mean you can see the kids in my little grandson's school all doing their same thing they just had their nativity play and they all sat there good and quiet because everyone else was sitting there good and quiet you know. Whereas my grandson I could tell what he really wanted to do was to start bopping around in the middle of the stage but he didn't do it because no one else was you know. 

He did at one point when they were all standing up start doing this you know then he looked at me and he looked at his mum and you're like, I better not talk [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1694s) that, but you know that's a bit different isn't it?

I think I said to somebody once that we kind of absorb things as children like it's almost like a process of osmosis it kind of goes into us yeah um so you know I mean I'm watching my grandson at the moment who's a bit on edge because there's some uncertainty over his father's work and you can just kind of see it in him you know that he's anxious, he's picking it up even though they're not talking about [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1724s) in his presence, it's just something kids do and we do have to be very careful about that I think.

But you know um yeah so I guess I think I learned in my childhood that the world was a very uncertain place. You never knew what was going to happen. You didn't know what rule was going to come next. And then there was that strange period of time between 1953 and [1959\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1755s) So six years of sort of an interregnum period between JT Senior and JT Jr. And there was a lot of tension around in the meetings. People were sort of, “Do you think he's going to be the leader? Do you think he's going to be the leader?” And also, I don't know whether you remember any of this, Richard, but you probably, you hadn't been born.

But it was, I mean, what was his name? Coates was his surname, CAC, they always referred him as. He was potentially going to be somebody, or there was another one, I can't remember his name now. So there was, and there was actually a mini split around 1955 that everybody forgets about. One of the families that we saw quite often left at that point. It was over the matter of worshipping of the Holy Spirit or something. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1808s)

That rings a bell.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1812s)

So, you know, I always say to people, the sort of eras, the periods within the Brethren history, they're sort of determined by the leaders almost.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1827s)

Yes.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1828s)

But don't let's get into a competition about it. They're all different, you know, they're all different. They all damage us in different ways.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1836s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1838s)

We all end up in the same pool. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1840s)

Yeah, everybody ends up slides into the same pool of trauma.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1844s)

Yeah, exactly. I mean it's like grief. Um, you know, sometimes you hear people saying, yeah, but she'd lived her life, hadn't she? As if that made the grief of the children left behind, right? And it just doesn't. So you know, these things should never be competitions in my opinion.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1864s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1864s)

So I want you tell the research or tell the listeners what you ended up doing with your life.

**Jill Abei-Mytton**

Yeah, I'm probably now where I should have been sort of 30 years ago. But you become a psychologist. I did eventually, but first of all, I was an occupational therapist. I was trying to be normal, you see. By then, by the time I was 17, we'd left the Brethren. I had two advanced levels under my belt, which were pretty bad scores on them. And everyone else was going to university. That was the thing you did, wasn't it? That was normal. I didn't know there were [thousands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1904s) of people who never went to university because, because I was in a in a public school I didn't get to know about all the kids that couldn't even read I just didn't know they existed so I thought I'll be normal I'll go to university then realized I couldn't so I literally went through the careers book one day and picked out all the things where I only needed two rubbishy A-levels and somehow I landed on occupational therapy so I did that

and worked in a huge psychiatric hospital in the south of London.

They've all gone now, there were big massive big institutions, awful places to work in. I used to go through these patients' notes and they'd go right back to the Victorian times, you know, that whole story of these people's lives and I began to realise that all these patients who were in psychiatric hospitals had in fact had very traumatic childhoods in one way or another and I just [wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=1960s) to know more and I thought well can't go to university and I thought yeah I could I could go to the Open University.

So I started one of the modules at the Open University and was very surprised when I did rather well with it and actually I then discovered that I could use that in order to go to the University of Sussex it was in the end which was amazing, amazing.

Of course my kids, this is where, one way my kids have suffered because I was doing all this while they were at school. I was a single mum by then you know so it was hard but um yeah I mean I lived in Switzerland for seven years too that was, when was that? That was after I did the training at the occupational therapy college, that's right, then I went to Switzerland then I came back to the UK because I couldn't cope with Switzerland or my husband and came back to the UK, worked in this psychiatric hospital and then did that degree and after that I thought well I can't go and be a clinical psychologist now because my kids are taking their exams.

Sso I thought what should I [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2031s) now? And I went and did a maths qualification and became a maths teacher because I knew there was a shortage of maths teachers.

And then on top of that... Actually, I didn't actually get to where I should have been all along, an academic and a university, until 1995\.

So that was when I started getting into research and... Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about. Yeah, seriously and, you know, I knew where I was going then. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2062s)

Because I think that's you, I mean your research that you've done, I mean your thesis is incredible that and the research that you've done on top of that then, I mean I know it created some ruckus inside the Plymouth Brethren, right? I mean that's a whole other podcast and a whole other show but um I think I think that is where the whole encyclopedia that lives inside you is going to be able to help us in these next few years.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2096s)

You think I'm going to be here for another few years? Yeah, oh yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2101s)

I told you I just need to come live there and take care of you so that I can nurture you for the next five to ten years. Very well, it's a spare time. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2114s)

But let's so if we get back onto this so I have a couple slides here that I just want to this is about like what an ex-member goes through when they leave. 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2126s)

Let's just go through this. Which one are you going to show, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2133s)

Yes, okay I'm just I'm just going to go through there's a, it's a list I just got to get my um full screen and I just got to go through here, okay yeah so it's, I found, I just like seeing things in black and white and I know our people who watch these on YouTube like to see things in black and white. We can sit here and we can talk, but it's different when you have things in black and white in a list. Tell us a little bit about this slide.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2158s)

Okay.

It should be fairly obvious to most people now that when you decide to leave or when you're kicked out or when you're taken out, as I was, that you go through a huge experience of loss. I mean you lose everything.

You lose your family because they shun you, you lose your friends for the same reason, quite often you can lose your home if you have to leave it in order to leave the brethren so you might still be living with your parents or something. Most people lose their job, we know why that is because everybody works in a brethren company and in a sense you lose your entire life you're losing everything that you ever knew your thoughts your [feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2206s) and everything so when you leave you get as I've said here this sudden void, absolute nothingness I remember thinking looking back on when I left and thinking it was like an earthquake, suddenly someone had ripped everything out from under my feet and unlike people who choose to join cults we've got no past life to return to. We haven't got a past to return to, all our past, our past, we call it the narrative inheritance of a family as Richard has explained, it goes back generations so all we've ever known is brethrenism.

The dissociation I've referred to already and the problem with that is it gets in the way. It is a coping mechanism that the brain uses to protect us from extreme anxiety and trauma but it becomes a habit and it gets in the way. My child, my two daughters used to say, “Mum sometimes you're just not with us you're just not there.” Yeah uh one of the big problems people have [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2276s) they leave is they just don't know how to be independent, they don't know what that means, they've relied on other people all their life um and they don't have the life skills anyway to live in the world, and in fact the brethren themselves say this in that Everyman Program on the Exclusive Brethren produced by the BBC, you can see those three brothers sitting at a table with with with a white sheet and everything, it was quite funny really um but one of them [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2306s) think it was Garth Christie actually says; “You know when people leave they're not equipped to live in this world they're just not.”  And he, they, know this and that's something that people who leave have to struggle with.

They're not, we're not, we didn't just leave a cultic group, we left our lives. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2324s)

And I think that's what's important for listeners to understand, right, is that it's your whole life you're leaving behind. You're literally leaving a world and you have to enter a whole other world.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2337s)

Exactly. And you, quite often you're doing it on your own. In the times of the big splits, the 1960 split and the 1970 split, a lot of people left at once so they had the comfort of other people around them and social support is actually very important when you're going through a stress. Yeah, trauma much, but people leave on their own. Um okay so this was the study I did in 2012, [2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2367s) to 2012 when it was rudely interrupted by the brethren, um whole other podcast putting it.

I had 264, 255 it says here, not everybody completes all the questionnaires when you send them out. I actually had 264 participants but obviously nine of them chose not to do this particular scale. This scale measures the existence of interpersonal problems so that's me talking to you but where I might have a difficulty, I might find it too hard to be assertive or I might be too aggressive etc. All those things along the bottom [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2409s) what was absolutely amazing when we compared the scores of the former brethren group with the non-clinical population. I don't know whether you know this, but statistically, when you give a questionnaire like this to somebody, you have a normative population. So whoever created this, it was Barkham and Hardy, they would have sent the questionnaire out to a bunch of people who were not [clinical.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2439s) They were people, ordinary run-of-the-mill people and they get their means that they would get on this scale and that that's the blue bars right so this is a non-clinical population that we're comparing the brethren population with and the important thing is that right the way across the board the difference is significant it's so huge it's such a big difference that is a massive difference.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2464s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2464s)

Um, yeah, yeah, I mean that was and this one was just off the charts. Same thing. Yeah, but different scales now.

Somatization, for anyone that's not sure what that is, that's when we complain of a stomach ache instead of saying we're deeply depressed. The Chinese do that a lot. If you want to know how a Chinese person is really feeling, it's very difficult because they somatize everything. Does that make sense?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2496s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2497s)

So you might hear, I mean, I know someone who's left recently who talks all the time about these terrible headaches he has. And yet, in spite of exhaustive investigations, there's nothing wrong with his head.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2512s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2513s)

So across again, right the way across, there are highly significant differences.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2520s)

And I mean, look at this, even depression, right? I mean there's so many people that it's one of the biggest things that we, the biggest hurdle I know for myself that I had to get over with is and a lot of my own depression was caused from grief. It's a huge amount of grief that you go through because you're living, you're living death for people who are living. It's like this [living](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2550s) grief that you're as if they're dead but yet they're alive. You know it's like ambiguous grief.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2556s)

My mother used to talk about her eldest son, my brother, in that sense. She would describe him as the living dead and it's true. Just one scale here, it's called paranoid ideation. That means you think the world's against you. Well of course when you've been in the brethren that is what you're taught to believe isn't it you know and now of course you've left so now the brethren are against you as well so it's hardly surprising that um that scale is is so high.

It did shock me and psychoticism here is really measuring strange ways of thinking right and what is really interesting, I mean we're going to be checking this again [hopefully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2600s) next year, but you know people have always said, you know it wasn't so hard back then but actually when I looked at how old people were at the age of leaving or which which decade they grew up in there was hardly any difference between people that left recently and people like me who left I don't know 40 50 60 years ago.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2621s)

I believe that. I really believe that.

Because we all, I mean that's what I like people always say to me you know Cheryl my story wasn't like yours and I'm like you know what it doesn't matter like for me I mean what I went through was normal to me because I was introduced to it so early on right? Like we all end up we all slide into the same pool of these symptoms no matter what your story was, how you left, what area you're in we all still went through every single one of all of these traumas [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2653s) we all talk about.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2654s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2656s)

There's no, there's no, yeah, there's just no separation in it.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2662s)

No.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2663s)

So when, I mean, let's just talk a little bit about PTSD. Um, like, so from your, your own personal opinion, do you think a lot of most ex-members suffer from PTSD?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2683s)

I do, yeah, I do. Um, we use the Davidson trauma scale in that study and again like with the other two scales um there was a mark, there was a significant difference between the general population and the former brethren sample. It was it was quite significant. And in a previous study that I'd done in 19, oh gosh, 90 around then, I didn't know very much about PTSD in those days but I'd created a questionnaire made up of things people had said to me and a lot of them were things like sometimes I can't stop thinking about the brethren, I get all hot around the collar, you know, those sorts of statements. And of course, what they were expressing was their trauma.

That's what they were talking about. And, you know, I can't bear it when I'm in the presence of something that reminds me of them. You know, that sort of avoidance type symptom. So, no, it's very clear to me. I can't just recall what the percentage was.

But it was very high. You know, it was extraordinarily high.

I don't know whether I've got it here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2762s)

And like, one of the biggest things that I'm getting as we're compiling a bunch of things, and I mean, obviously a lot of people will reach out to us from doing the podcast. So there's this, there's this, obviously it's dissociation of not wanting to look back at the past. But then there's these other people who are in therapy. And this, this, the same sense statement comes over and over in my inbox of, “I'm in therapy, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2792s) I feel my therapist doesn't understand me. Cheryl, what have you tried?”

 What can I do? Where do we go from here? Is there somebody out there that can help us with our trauma? Trauma because it is such a complex trauma and I think a lot of people when they dive into therapy and they've tried a couple therapists and they don't feel this connection they don't feel like they're getting their help they need guess what, they put the monkey back in the cage. I mean I did this many times they put the monkey back in the cage zip it up be like yeah no I can't go there this is my life I left I'm free let's go [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2822s) right. Like what would you say to people who are in these boats of really wanting to dissociate from what happened and those people who just can't find the right therapy?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2834s)

Well as regards to dissociating from what happened or avoiding symptoms and um avoiding places that that remind them of what happened, I would say if it's it's a coping mechanism. I strongly, I have problems with the PTSD diagnosis for this reason, um because if you have a headache, the doctor will look to see what's causing the headache.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2858s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2858s)

They don't focus on the headaches. They might give you symptomatic treatment by saying take an aspirin or a paracetamol or something but they are keen to know what the cause is. The cause of the dissociation is the trauma that people went through and actually dissociation, avoidance, hypervigilance, startle response, sort of what's happening, you know, being very alert to things. That's your mind trying to cope with a realisation that the world is not a safe place. And they're all coping mechanisms that we use to protect ourselves.

So, you know, the first time, for example, that James asked me to appear on the podcast, I went, danger. I could almost feel my brain going danger, danger. Right.

Um, so I thought no not this time I need to I need to figure out what that's all about first but our brains are amazing organs you know we're faced with these threats and these difficulties and what do we do our brain says I can't deal with this one so I'm going to shut down for a bit. 

And if it's really really bad you shut down completely. I had recently someone contact me whose wife has shut down so completely she can't even talk to anybody she [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2936s) sits in a huddled state and she wasn't in the brethren, she was in another group um but she's clearly so traumatized that she can't cope with this at all and the mistake her therapist made I think, because she did begin to emerge, was she pushed it too much. 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2953s)

You have to be very careful. First of all you need a kind of person-centered approach so that the person who's been traumatized and in particular at the moment since we're talking about former brethren, they don't trust anyone anymore and yet they trust too much. It's a kind of an odd paradox. Yeah, but that's therapeutic relationship before any work is done has to be one where the person feels safe, where they feel they can trust [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=2983s) therapist. And if people are saying to you my therapist doesn't understand, get out. It's not going to work. Yeah, because that therapist has to understand and if they don't understand they need to say to the client I'm really sorry but I can't help you because I cannot understand your experience. I need to go away and do some studying myself and some retraining or I need to find myself a clinical supervisor who can help me understand your [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3013s) because it's outside of my experience. That's what the therapist should say. A lot of therapists don't understand. I mean I went through three or four therapists before I found the right one.

Um, I tried a person-centered therapist but he was more interested in his dog that was sitting on the floor than in what happened to me and his first question to me as you'll see at the beginning of my thesis was, so what do the brethren believe? I didn't know.

At the age of 40 something, I couldn't talk about what the brethren believed in. You don't say to an anorexic, so what's anorexia then?

There's a complete mismatch somewhere. I mean, I'm hoping that things are gradually improving, but until the client feels safe, and nurtured, I want to say, by that therapist, no therapist is going to get anywhere near being able to help. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3076s)

And I think they need to feel, they need to feel seen, right? And yeah, right. That is the biggest thing. Like I have a new therapist right now that I've started just recently, and she's just incredible, incredible with how she sees me. And she, she's still learning about the brethren as we go along but her whole presence is about seeing you and validating you and there's just this safe space you can slide into. I've never [experienced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3107s) therapy like it before and obviously everything comes at the right time right so she came into my life when I needed it but I had, and that's kind of what I have said to people is that it's super important to try different therapists to try different even therapies right and see what works for you right?  
I personally know I would not be where I am today without my therapy there's there's just no way I would be right, like I think therapy is so important.

This isn't going away that you can stick that monkey back in its cage as many times as you want but it's still there. I had someone who as we were collecting stuff for um the things that we're doing in Canada I don't know how much we're supposed to say but anyhow we're doing some stuff in Canada we're collecting people's information and someone who wasn't, he wasn't really hesitant on it but um he messaged me after and he said that felt so good to write that all down [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3168s) I'm like it does. I said you, we become so accustomed to carrying this weight and even though we got our freedom there still is this importance of turning around and dealing with the trauma we went through the life we had to live behind. And i'm not saying doing it right after you leave, go and experiment, and get out there but at some point in time in your life you got to look in that rear view mirror and you've got to look at all those pieces of yourself that are crying that are fearful that are [grieving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3198s) that are so disassociated that they they keep teaching you to push forward, push forward push forward instead of just sitting down and letting everything out, exactly you gotta let it out.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3211s)

Empowerment as well, isn't it? About empowerment because I think sometimes therapists are trained to do an assessment, yeah, and to them that means asking a lot of questions. But a lot of people who've left the brethren don't want a lot of questions. They don't want probing questions to find out so where were you born, where were you, what are your parents like, what was your relationship with them and all these sort of these sorts of questions that we can get hammered with by the medical profession.

Which is why I say person-centered, because a person-centered therapist won't do that. They'll sit down with you and they'll wait for you to talk. They'll help you explore.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3246s)

Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3247s)

That doesn't mean that the whole approach is person-centered but person-centered particularly at the beginning until that trust and safety develops and until the person feels heard, understood, seen as you said, unconditionally accepted and the therapist mustn't move too fast. The speed has to come from the person who's been traumatized, has to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3275s)

And that therapist that I'm going to now that she's slowed everything right down, right? And I cannot believe the amount of transformation that happens within me on every level because we've slowed down so much. You know, there's many ex-members particularly the men and people that left uh boys that left when they were teens that when they turn around and go to look at this it's just this extreme rage and they, I mean a lot of that is like well I can't open that [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3305s). I get it. Makes me way too angry, I don't know what to do with this rage, I don't know what to do with this anger and I find that in, just in the people that I'm talking to that that is a very huge symptom amongst the men. 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3321s)

Yeah, yeah, I agree with you. I mean there's so many different aspects of our experiences that need exploring. You spoke a little while back of grief, you know, therapist needs to think about that as well. Is this person grieving at the moment? If they're grieving at the moment, then I shouldn't really perhaps they shouldn't really work on their traumas right now. But it's the patient, the client, whatever you want to call them, that has to take that in because there is grief [there,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3351s) there is the trauma. Um, even if there's, you see what a lot of people don't understand is that you don't have to have a specific trauma to be affected.

 You know, that's where the complex PTSD comes from. The complex PTSD as a diagnosis uses the PTSD triad as they call it, the three main symptoms, but it adds, it adds the dysregulation of emotion, the fact that we struggle with our feelings, the fact that this young boy gets so angry that he doesn't know what to do with himself, you know, or another young man draws the knife on the person that's looking after him. [Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3391s) Because he just doesn't know what else to do because there's, you know, he doesn't know where to go with those feelings. And that's the difference between the two types of PTSD. But they're coping mechanisms. 

A lot of symptoms are coping mechanisms and that's one thing that a therapist also needs to understand because if I said to you, oh Cheryl, you avoid going to church because it triggers you, well I think you should go to church. I think you should go and stand in the doorway of that church and wait until your [anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3421s) calms down. What am I doing? And that's what people do and it works if you've had a car accident, so it's one episode, one incident, but it doesn't work when it's a coping mechanism that has kept you safe for years, kept me safe for years. I couldn't go near a church. I couldn't even talk about whether I was a christian or not. Believe me, lots of ex-brethren always want to ask me that question. I can cope with it now but [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3451s) was a time when that question would completely freak me out because I couldn't go there. It was too dangerous for my brain and it was protecting itself.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3461s)

One thing that really makes it very, very difficult for ex-brethren to go into therapy is that most ex-brethren would have had very traumatic experience of visits from priests in which they were questioned in a kind and in very much the same way as a therapist would question them. And then, of course, they were betrayed. They were let down. The things they confided were spread around. And just sort of [sitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3491s) in a chair and trying to be vulnerable and speak about your feelings with someone brings all that back. It's like a priestly visit.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3501s)

Absolutely. And all the confessions that Craig spoke about the other day on his podcast, you know, the fact that you sat there and you were pushed into making. Of course, we didn't have that. Right. But certainly when that came in, that was another very, very difficult situation and does make it difficult for people to talk to their therapist. I agree.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3522s)

And I think too, going through everything that grief, grief doesn't always just show itself as in tears and crying and heartache. Grief shows itself in so many ways. And I've often, I know of my own personal experiences that often my anger and rage is its guard to grief, right? And so I think it's important for, for ex-members and leavers to really understand that when you're dealing with these heightened, heightened emotions that if you were just to sit, I [guarantee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3552s) you that grief is trying to find its way out. The separation that we go through and that's what I was telling you, Jill, is like it doesn't like just somebody leaving that's had even say no trauma ,trauma inside the church, it just has to make this choice to leave. That leaving one world to another world and the grief that happens inside on that bridge from one world to another is enough to [shatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3582s) and I mean PTSD just comes from just from that one transition.

And so I think it's important for everybody to understand that you, we all suffer just from leaving the church and coming to the outside world that however you left, yeah, like it's such a huge trauma to have to let go of your entire way of being, your life. And I mean there's even nowadays where they're signing contracts that if you leave that business stays with the brethren. [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3614s) it's they, they've got they take everything and then you've got to come out with what's on your back and try and navigate your world.

 Like I do think for me, I find any kind of grief workshop that comes up, I take it because I'm always wanting tools and how to recognize how my grief shows itself because it is I'm always wanting to unwind this pattern of tension. I'm like I'm ready to unwind this. I'm like this [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3644s), I'm doing it, this life I'm getting this unwound. So I think it's important for leavers to recognize that if it's anger and it is this rage, do you think it's safe to say, Jill, that sometimes it is grief that presents itself through that rage and anger?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3661s)

Yes, I do think that. Um, and and of course there is such a thing as righteous anger, hate to say that word, but there is. Absolutely. It's not necessarily an irrational anger. No. That you know, whoever whoever led whatever or whoever led to that person leaving kind of instigated this massive loss that that person's experienced. For me, I mean, for me, a lot of it is about normalizing someone's situation, not saying it's normal, but normalizing, saying that it was like Viktor Frankl when he left the concentration camp said that, you know, an abnormal reaction to an abnormal event is actually a normal reaction, right? If you left the Holocaust, those concentration camps and just thought, oh, well, that's [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3709s) done and went off into the sunset, that would be an abnormal reaction because of what you've been through. 

And it's the same here. You would expect anger. You would expect. Exactly. And I think the reason why one of the reasons why people are reaching out to you and to me and to others is because those that are inside are actually looking for what the theorists would call a transitional attachment. Somebody they can just hold on that provides that bridge between the two worlds makes it just that [little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3739s) bit easier. Right. I mean, all the participants in my qualitative research, the thesis, they all found attachments, transitional attachments. Because don't forget that it's not just your natural family you're leaving, you're leaving the cultic group family which kind of is wrapped around your family. It's one person, right? It's this, yeah, entity, one family. Yeah, and it's this family you've been taught is more [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3769s) than your real, than your biological family, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3772s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3773s)

So when you leave, you ah, it's gone, shattered. What do I do? I'm all on my own now. I've got nobody to hold on to. So that's why I think they reach out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3784s)

And I think it's important that we have a landing pad for them out here. And I think that's like one of the biggest, I mean, the biggest passions of mine that I have now is to make sure that there's this landing pad, make sure that there's these tools for those that are wanting to transition out. I mean, unfortunately, I wish the judicial system was behind us in the matter of like a family wanting to leave and he can't leave because he doesn't want to lose his business and him feeling with me be like, hey, like, [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3814s) take your foot off the gas, we need to see this through. I know this is hard on you, but it's harder for us trapped in here. We need to make a way for us. I want to leave but I want to leave with my family intact, my business intact, and until that happens, I can't leave. 

And so I think it's important for our listeners to realize why we're so vocal, why we get into some of these very deep conversations is because the more of us that band together and create this movement that opens up the government's eyes that [opens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3844s) up the judicial systems holes that they have to be able to really help these people that are trapped in there. These are families, these aren't just disgruntled teenagers that are wanting to rebel, these are like families that realize that this is a cult.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3860s)

Yeah, that's right. I mean the government here has tried way back in 1970 something with the Gresham-Cooke Family Preservation Bill. You know about that, Richard?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3870s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3871s)

My father got involved with that. Of course this was some time after we'd left and he got involved with that but sadly it didn't pass the second reading. So the government's…very difficult to get governments to listen.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3882s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3884s)

Especially when in this case the brethren lobby them so much. Yeah, and well I better not say it but you can guess what, you know, I mean financially, I'll just drop that word in. Yeah, right, it is, it's yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3900s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So I, we always ask our, we always ask our um guests this. So I have to ask you, what do you think is the biggest downfall of the brethren?

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3915s)

Am I only allowed one? Oh no, you can give us a top 20\. I think from our perspective, the biggest downfall is the fact that they won't talk to us, right? They head straight for the lawyers whenever wherever there's something they don't like, they go straight to the lawyers. And I said to my brother once, why don't you just talk to me? Why don't the brethren talk to me instead of going to the lawyers? It would be a lot cheaper and we might find a way, you know, we might find be able to negotiate [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3945s) compromise. But then of course that takes you back to what's underlying it all, well it's and it's this doctrine of separation, isn't it? It's been there from the very very beginning. You know, John Nelson Darby in spite of all the things that he said, believed in this doctrine of separation, which initially was ecclesiastical, it was about churches, but it very quickly became more of an interpersonal kind of separation that we all know and hate.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3975s)

Yeah, that's so true. It's so true. So, and the other one of the last questions that we ask is if you had your chance to go back to the PBCC and they actually were going to listen to Jill, what would you say to them? You mean if they let me back in? Yeah, and you got to address and they were like, you know what, we want to hear from you, Jill.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=3996s)

Oh, I see. I would talk to them about all the kinds of stuff that we've been talking about this evening. I would ask them, do you actually understand how distressing everybody feels when they leave your group? That's not how it should be. You claim you're a mainstream church, but if you leave a mainstream church, you just walk out the door. You don't get shunned by everybody, your family and your friends. You don't lose your business. You just walk out the door.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4027s)

 It's just they don't even hire private investigators to follow you generally. 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4030s)

No, Exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4034s)

I mean, oh dear. Yeah, you know what,  I'm just putting this on every podcast I do now.  I want to talk to Bruce Hales. I want to talk to Bruce Hales, sit down and have a conversation exactly what you're talking about, Jill, is sit down, let's talk. Is there some way to repair this? Right? Yeah, he can go in there and he can change all of these rules inside there, but the past still is right here in the now. That's what this is, the [past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4064s) still following up behind him saying like we need to clean this up. It's out here, it's still hurting, it's still…

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4072s)

If they don't, if they don't clean up their act soon, it's possible I guess that other people will. When I'm talking about what we were saying a moment ago, governments and law keepers, you know, that um they won't be allowed to go on doing what they're doing. 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4088s)

No, I agree, yeah, 100%, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're just pushing the envelope, pushing the envelope, seeing how far they can go. I mean they, you know, up till relatively recently, they've generally stayed within the boundaries of the letter of the law, but now they're going way beyond that. They're going right into criminality and they're just seeing how much they can get away with. Um, you know, the balloon's gonna burst. Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4115s)

Which is going to be difficult for those people who are still there. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4121s)

Yeah. Was there anything else you wanted to share with us Jill? We could probably talk for another six hours, couldn't we? You could.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4131s)

You look like you've got a library behind you, Jill.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4134s)

I know, that's what I said. It's all of her knowledge. 

**Jill Abei-Mytton**

That's why I need a high ceiling so that my thoughts can waft upwards.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4149s)

Ah well we're very appreciative of you coming on and taking the time to come on. Um, I know it's getting later on in the evening there for you and you are welcome on anytime. I'm sure we'll have you multiple times on and dive into different things. And I know you're wanting to get back into your research again, right? Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4166s)

I'm wanting to get back into my research but I am very keen to talk further also about this whole therapy side of things and and you know because I want to hear from people what other people, you know, what's benefited you what's helped and what hasn't helped. Yeah I do because there's no there's very little research out there about the impact of therapy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4186s)

And so maybe that's what we need to do is just kind of put that out for to the listeners of like if you've had a successful therapy work for you can you message us email us and we'll bring Jill back on, and I did want to get into that but I'd like to designate a whole hour to therapies.

 I think we need to go  right through the therapies, all the different types of therapies that can help so if we kind of just put it out there for the listeners that if you've got a type of therapy that's worked for you email us let us do some research and we'll come [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4217s) with a list of how those people who have gotten through um a good chunk of their trauma,  how did you do it, and then we can share it with everybody.

Because I know there's there's that's one of the biggest questions I get, Cheryl what therapist do you use? What therapy do you use? um mine's not working…and so I do think that that deserves its own podcast on its own so bring you back for that Jill if you're willing to come on.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4239s)

Absolutely yeah, I mean it would be an exploratory one more because um yeah I mean I talk from my own experience I can talk from what the books say but it's really what the people…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4252s)

Definitely. It is like I know it's worked for me, and I mean I know there were certain therapies that you had suggested that I now have a friend that got certified in it and she's having extreme success with with her investigation into it and so yeah I think it deserves its own podcast and we'll definitely have you back on and we'll discuss all the different therapies. Yeah well thank you so much Jill for coming on and blessing us with your beautiful brain and soul and spirit and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4282s) just I love I could sit and talk to you for hours.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4284s)

I love talking to you. I've given up, I've given up one thing, I no longer think I'm worthless.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4291s)

Very much. We we need you and this movement needs you. You've been doing this, Jill. I mean what we're doing now, you started how many years ago, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4303s)

Yeah, we're standing on your shoulders. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4306s)

Yeah, I mean I remember contacting you over 20 years ago and I mean you don't remember it but I remember it. And you are your pivotal root for us to grow on top of, right? 

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4329s)

I hope you start growing soon, I mean, right back at you, because I've just gobsmacked with the way that this is mushroomed this year and how great you four, four, where's the fourth one?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4338s)

Yeah, Lane's not with us today, but yes. Yeah.

### [**Jill Aebi-Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4340s)

How things have grown this year, it's been astounding, you know. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4345s)

And we're grateful for the people that are inside still that reach out to us and give us their messages and their words of encouragement. They're very much needed. There are days when you know we want to take our foot off the gas and just breathe a little bit, and then we get those messages and emails from those inside and it gets my foot right back on the gas like yeah, that's what we're doing this for, that's what we're doing this for. Anyhow okay thank you so much [Jill.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ4kj9mz5Cc&t=4375s) Take care everyone and we'll have Jill back on again for part two.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
