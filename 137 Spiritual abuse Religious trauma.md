## Summary

Broken, crushed, smashed. Dominated by a superior will. Submission to a despot.
These are not extracts from the North Korean Constitution or the playbook of some kinky sex cult, but the “divinely inspired” ministry of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Today, we bring daylight to some of the darkest perversions of Christianity devised by these self-procIaimed mainstream Christians.
Religious Trauma expert Sam, our own much loved Lindy, and Dennis Wragge join us as we discuss spiritual abuse, and how our personal spiritual experiences change and develop when we escape from the thought police and blindness of an all-powerful cult and experience the freedom of enjoying spirituality each in our own way.

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3s)

Actually, you know how on social media, sometimes we see quotes and we cross something out and we replace it with something and they go, we fixed it. I think that bottom one, if we change the ending can be a very good descriptive of what spiritual abuse is encompassing, which is it's when our wills have been smashed. That's when we are at our most controllable.

And that's the descriptive of what spiritual abuse at its core is about [control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=34s) and we know from not just cults but, you know, torture camps as well, which is when somebody's whole entire sense of self and their whole will, their whole entirety of their being has been beaten down, smashed, manipulated, you know, all of those, that's when they're at the most controllable, that's when we've got you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=55s)

I think as well for me, when I look at the Bible, I see so many stories of power and control and spiritual abuse and betrayal and manipulation all through it. Like it's actually a very unholy book of, you know, all sorts of tales of horror. And a lot of it is around religious, you know, the use and name of God to do all sorts of things.

And I think even when you look at the life of Jesus [himself,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=86s) it's very clear all through the Gospels. It's a fight between, you know, the religious leaders of the day and their power and domination and control over people and society. Over, you know, and it clearly sets up Jesus as the protagonist against these powers and forces. So these battles that we're fighting and talking about today are all through the Gospels, they're all through the New Testament. [There's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=116s) nothing new there.

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast. I am Cheryl Bawtinheimer and with me today is Richard Marsh, Sam Sellers from Australia, Lindy Jacomb from New Zealand, and Dennis Wragge from Canada appears later on in this podcast. For those of you that are new to our channel, Richard, Lindy, Dennis, and myself are ex-members of the Exclusive Brethren, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). Thanks everyone for joining us today.

Today we are going to be talking about a very important subject, and one that comes up often when helping those inside this cult get ready to leave. Leaving the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church involves traumatic loss. Relationships with friends and family are severed. Employment and home are usually lost. But there is another trauma that we rarely speak about, and that is the loss of a religious belief that has been indoctrinated into us over generations.

As the realization that the Plymouth Brethren Christian [Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=233s) is a fraudulent religion run by corrupt men, our entire universe has stood on its head. We realize that we are not, in fact, God's chosen people or guaranteed a special place in heaven, but rather the victims of a most obscure cult that has long since left the rails and is far removed from any semblance of being a mainstream Christian church.

Our podcast today is a conversation about the spiritual abuse that is intrinsic to the PBCC [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=263s) how to navigate the frightening and confusing task of rebuilding your spiritual confidence in the real world that you now find yourself living in. I reached out to many insiders and recent leavers and asked them questions regarding this task of rebuilding your faith after leaving a cult and what those fears are, and we are going to discuss those. Sam is a religious trauma therapist from Australia, and Lindy is the founder of Olive Leaf Network that assists people leaving [high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=293s) demand religious groups. I think we have the perfect dynamic duo to dive into this topic so let's get started. I want to first dive into terms we need to go through before this discussion gets started. Lindy do you want to start us off with that?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=311s)

Yeah that sounds good. Kia ora and hello to everybody. It's great to be back on a Get-A-Life podcast and with Sam as well, who I have made acquaintance with last year. And I think it's going to be wonderful to hear from her as well. But yeah, I think it is important to define the terms whenever you talk about something like this, because lots of different terms are used and sometimes the meaning of things changes over time.

So yeah, some of the terms that people use are spiritual abuse, and then there's religious trauma and it'd be great to have a chat about, you know, how those are different. Other terms I hear people use are things like religious extremism, religious deconstruction or disaffiliation. Some of them, you know, get into real big mouthfuls but let's have a chat about that. So Sam, you're from the religious trauma collective, you must [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=367s) what religious trauma is if it's in the name of your, you know, entity. How could you tell us what you, the religious trauma collective, what you guys understand the term to mean and how you might see it as being different or the same as spiritual abuse?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=384s)

Yeah, so I think what is really important to get clear is that spiritual abuse is what is happening to you and the religious trauma is what's happening in you. That's a very simple way to make the difference between those two things. So when we talk about trauma, irrespective of what type of trauma it is, we're talking about the nervous system response, the way that it's living in your body, the internal impact of what has [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=414s) to you.

So the spiritual abuse is all of the external stuff and the religious trauma is what's happening internally. In terms of religious trauma itself, it's any way that your internal landscape, your nervous system, your body is either emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, or physically impacted by religious or spiritual harm. And that can come from a person or it can come from a doctrine or it [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=444s) come from a belief. It can come from a variety of different places.

I think that's where a lot of people, particularly in the therapy space, religious trauma is still not well understood. And I think the misconception is that religious trauma is just harm perpetuated by religious people. And I think that that's a very narrow way to look at religious trauma. And I think it misses a whole gap of doctrine, beliefs, rituals, practices [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=475s) can all also cause trauma.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=477s)

Right, yeah that's really interesting because that was one of my questions that I've sat with before too around, or I know it's a debate out there particularly in the therapist space, is how is it different from say emotional abuse or all the other forms of abuse? What is unique about spiritual abuse? And or religious trauma, and so yeah, if I'm hearing you right, you're saying that it, yeah, it's not just that it might be abuse or [trauma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=507s) received from religious people itself, but you're saying that it's the religion or the spirituality itself and particular beliefs or practices or rituals associated with that religion or spirituality. It's some of those that can be actually the source of harm themselves.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=528s)

Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=531s)

That's really interesting.

I did come across, I bought a book that came out, I think it was only last year, called Escaping the Maze of Spiritual Abuse by Dr. Lisa Oakley in the UK. I think it came from her PhD. So it was kind of quite dense, actually. It wasn't necessarily a light read, but I do recommend it to anyone who's interested. But I found her definition really helpful and she discusses all these dynamics as well of what actually is it, why is it different? But yeah, on page 31 she says [spiritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=563s) abuse is a form of emotional and psychological abuse. It is characterized by a systematic pattern of coercive and controlling behavior in a religious context. So I'll just say that again, it's characterized by a systematic pattern of coercive and controlling behavior in a religious context.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=587s)

I would add a caveat to that because I think it can also happen in a family home and that might not be considered a religious context, but spiritual abuse can still happen in a family home.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=599s)

Oh, yeah, okay. So it's a domestic religious context if the domestic setting is really defined by the religion. Yeah, I thought it was really interesting that she brought in that systematic pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour as well, that it's like, because that's important, isn't it? It's not just like a one-off thing. It's that there's this whole environment, this whole pattern that is deeply defined by it.

Yeah, and she goes on and says it might include manipulation, exploitation, enforced accountability, [censorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=630s) of decision-making, requirements for secrecy and silence, coercion to conform, control through the use of sacred texts or teaching, requirement of obedience to the abuser, the suggestion that the abuser has a divine position, that's really important isn't it, isolation as a means of punishment, and superiority and elitism. Just so much there that I encourage any brethren listeners or former brethren to really sit with then look at with an open mind and go, are any of these things true of my experience in the Brethren? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=671s) if so, you know, have a good think about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=675s)

Yeah, you could go and check off every single one, personally for myself, every single one of those with my upbringing in the Exclusive Brethren. Absolutely. I'm sure Richard can say the same, and I'm sure you can say the same, Lindy, you know?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=690s)

So should we quickly look at those other terms that we briefly discussed? One is religious deconstruction, do either of you want to speak to that?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=703s)

I'm happy to point out I guess the difference between religious trauma and religious deconstruction. So because I think the two particularly online and in social media they get like, they just get like enmeshed and intertwined together. Yeah, and they're not the same thing. And so like I said, religious trauma is your nervous system's response to what has happened to you. Religious deconstruction is a very cognitive process.

So I will [typically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=733s) say that nearly everybody who has religious trauma will deconstruct, but not everybody who is deconstructing has religious trauma. And so religious deconstruction is just a dismantling of core beliefs, essentially. But we don't particularly, when we deconstruct one thing, we don't typically stop there. We are deconstructing all systems in society. From everything that I have seen in terms of those who are deconstructing, they [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=764s) just deconstruct religion, they'll deconstruct patriarchy and race and colonization and monogamy and marriage and all of the things that come with that. But it's a typically cognitive process where we are going, where have I learned this? Why do I believe this? Does this serve me anymore? What do I actually think as opposed to just what I have been told? And it's a very critical thinking type of process.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=794s)

I think this is where a lot of people that are coming out of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church right now, they are struggling or people who are wanting to come out. This is their fear. They fear this world. And what is this world going to do to their faith? I have a few that I'm talking to very, very in depth about that right now, which is why we really wanted to do this podcast is because it is coming up as a theme.

So when I left the cult, I was still going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=825s) a public school, whereas now they don't. They have their own schools. Their isolation is that much more secure. And I think a lot of these people that have one foot in, one foot out, especially those that want to hold on to a Christian faith, are petrified of taking that last foot out into a world that they've been taught is utterly hell. And how do I navigate that? It is like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=855s) specific person right now is the fear is like at a 10\. How would someone deconstruct the indoctrination while trying to hold on to the freedom and yet still hold on to some sort of faith that they know they want to have in order to be able to make this transition.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=877s)

Yeah, I mean, one thing that, one comment that frequently comes up in ex-brethren conversations is, and you know, it's a very difficult subject because there's a certain tension between ex-brethren who remain, you know, quite fundamentalist Christians and ex-brethren who become quite strong atheists. One comment you often get from the Christian side about the other side is, well, they've thrown out the baby with the [bathwater.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=907s) And my kind of personal response to that is that, well, when I looked in the bathwater, it looked more like a pot of stew, there wasn't really any recognizable baby left. So I threw it all out and started again.

Now, everyone has different experiences, but I would, you know, I would hope that you would agree that it's okay if you want to make a fresh start with a fresh sheet of paper. You know, if you can recover something and decontaminate it, that's good. I'm not against that. But sometimes the indoctrination is so deep that you just have to start with a blank sheet. And I think that's one kind of deconstruction, isn't it?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=954s)

I would suggest that the people who are riddled with fear around deconstructing and questioning those beliefs are the people who fall into the, I have religious trauma and I am deconstructing. Because typically spaces that are cult-like or are cults or high control groups create cognitive shortcuts, which is why it's so easy for people who leave those environments to land in other fundamental environments because we are so typically sort of conditioned and indoctrinated to think this is good, this is bad, this is right, this is wrong.

And the cognitive shortcuts just get rid of all of the critical thinking ability that we have. And it's when we [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1001s) to question that it sends our nervous system into absolute chaos. Your nervous system goes, what the fuck is this? Like what is happening, right? And it just, it's why we see people riddled with fear. It's why we see dissociation. It's why we see hyper vigilance where we're just hyper aware and internally hyper aware. It's not just externally of, am I allowed to think this? Am I allowed to believe this? What is going to happen to me if I even ask the question? [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1031s) there is like the fear of hell that is like hardwired into your system. And so when you start to try and look outside of those shortcuts, it's terrifying, not just on a cognitive level, but your nervous system is actually responding to that fear.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1050s)

Yeah. And I mean, one thing that's very characteristic of the Brethren doctrine is they instill a kind of internal thought police. You know, God knows your thoughts. And if you think something wrong, something terrible will happen to you. So unlike, you know, the dictators would love if they could do this, but they can't. But the brethren literally install a policeman inside your own head to watch your thoughts and punish you for them, which is, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1080s) know, one of the hardest things may be when you're starting deconstructing, is just to allow yourself to think the unthinkable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1089s)

I want to ask Lindy though, because Lindy, like when you, like you seem to be somebody that I could sit back and look at how you were able to leave this. Walk us through, walk us through how you left and how you were able to deconstruct the cultism out of it, how you landed in wherever you've landed it and been able to hold on to this essence of your faith because to me you do it beautifully.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1117s)

Yeah, a couple of things are running through my head. I mean, I do want to say again, this is a topic with so many layers and, you know, we could genuinely talk about this for hours and so it's going to be hard to kind of try and keep it succinct for our listeners today. Maybe you might have to do a follow-up session, Cheryl, but yeah, I think the brethren are very black and white with their theology and their religion, their worldview. It's [extremely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1148s) black and white and it's like in or out. And that's brought up from the get-go with you.

And I think it's really important to name that because in my opinion, you know, when I look around at this wide, wonderful world with its diversity of humanity and belief and social systems and everything, there is very little that actually is black and white. Instead, it's not even shades of grey, it's multicoloured. And it is actually, yeah, there's incredible diversity and flexibility with things.

And I guess for me, right at the get-go, when I was a teenager in the brethren starting to weigh up, is there really a God or not? I just thought, well if there is a God, this God has got to reflect somehow the diversity of this incredible world we live in with its amazing different array of ethnicities and cultures and everything that it just doesn't make sense that this one tiny little group of mostly white people in just a handful of countries [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1211s) his special chosen ones. Like that just didn't make sense, it was like if there is a God who created the world and everything, he must be very big and very colorful and very diverse himself.

But I do remember, you know, you asked me for a personal reflection. One thing I remember doing, I remember that overwhelm of like, of going, oh my gosh, like if I don't believe some of this, does that mean do I then become black and white in reverse and go, okay, it must all be rubbish and I don't know what to believe anymore. And I remember thinking, I need some anchors. I just need one or two anchors that when I head out there, I'm going to believe in those things. They're going to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1252s) my guiding stars, you know, just two or three things that I'm determined to believe in.

And you know, for me, yeah, I can't remember them exactly, but it was around going, yep, I think there is a God, but it's this concept of it's a much bigger God than I know and can even grasp. And I'm open to exploring this God with curiosity and with, you know, open hands really. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1283s) yeah, and secondly, for me, it was around just having a sense of trust of, yep, I'm as scared as hell and yeah I'm carrying this deep fear and trauma in my system. I'm so frightened, but insisting on believing that there's good to be found out there and good to be found in people.

Unlike what the brethren taught that, you know, everyone out there is out to get you. And yeah, those are things that have continued to guide me and I've continued to be, you know, to use a Christian word, blessed by those because there are so many good people out here and there's so much goodness to be found out here. And it's nothing to do with traditional religion or whether people are Christian or not or it's just, it's just a fact of life. There's, yep, sure there's bad stuff out here and there's [fucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1336s) up stuff, but there's also incredible beauty and joy. And so I think one of the first things is probably acknowledging that you've been taught to think in a black and white way and then like, yeah, cognitively setting that aside and going, I refuse to keep living in that way.

And to have that openness and curiosity as to what's out there, you know, letting that curiosity lead you, not the fear define you.

A second thing I'd say is like for me, learning about institutionalization really helped, like the battery hen thing, and I think that's a really good picture again of what's happening. Institutionalization is a word that's often used to refer to people who've been in jail or prison for a long time or, you know, like other forms of highly structured care and that when they come out, they don't know how to live, they don't know how to think anymore, they don't know how to structure their day or [choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1396s) what values to live by.

And I find it a fascinating term for applying in these situations because, again, what we're talking about here today, I know I understand with the Religious Trauma Collective, you guys are dealing with people from a wide variety of spectrum of harm. There might be some people who have largely had a really good experience in religion, but then they've had a particular leader or some form of prayer that was really harmful and so you [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1426s) be just dealing with that, whereas with the brethren, we are talking about a very deep institutionalization form of religion that's comprehensive with all of your life. And so I think it makes sense then that when people come to step out of that or find themselves kicked out of it, it's just absolutely paralyzing and overwhelming because you don't know how to function without the institution around you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1452s)

Yeah, I agree. Like Sam, what kind of advice would you give those people who are paralyzed with that fear as they are packing their bags and knowing that they're, that they're on that way to facing that fear? What are a couple points that we can give them to hold on to as they make this transition?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1475s)

I think from, I mean, it's tricky because in terms of like the paralyzation of fear, obviously we want to talk about targeting your body. That's what's going to be the best thing. And it's, it's coming back to your senses, and, and going, you know, some really simple things like just having some cold water to get some cold into your system. And it's not about, in that moment, it's not actually about dealing with the fear [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1506s) dealing with the actual fear itself, it's just about getting your nervous system to be able to move.

And in that situation, we are utilizing all of our survival responses. You are essentially escaping an unsafe situation and we actually want our body to use its survival response and its adrenaline response. And so I am all for grounding, but actually we want our adrenaline in that [situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1536s) because that's actually what's going to keep us safe. Yeah, does that make sense?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1541s)

Absolutely, I mean it does to me. Yeah, that's such a great answer, such a great answer.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1548s)

Yeah, I mean one thing that insiders tend to say, you know, when they're thinking about getting out, one of their fears is they're afraid that if they leave the Plymouth Brethren, they will become an atheist.

And I would say, and you know, correct me on this, that you become in control of your own destiny. And if you don't want to become an atheist, of course, you won't become an atheist. If you want to stay a Christian, you can remain a Christian. You have agency and control over your own life while they, they use this fear tactic of telling you if you leave here you, I mean they literally say if you leave, if you leave the brethren, you can't take [salvation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1591s) with you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1593s)

Yeah, yeah I agree with you Richard. I think that one of, again, it's identifying that one of the really powerful things about the brethren or any of these kind of spiritually controlling environments is that they define and determine your life for you, your beliefs, your values, your everything. And not only that, they teach you that that is good. They teach you that there is no other way other than to hand over all of [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1623s) authority and agency from your life to them. They teach you that that's right. In fact, you might have a ministry quote there that may fit with that.

So we'll go to that next. But I think that's a critical piece is for people in that position to be reminded that you have choice, you have agency, you have the ability to self-determine. And it's a wonderful thing at times [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1653s) learn from and take leadership from others and sometimes even to submit to authority. I wouldn't term it that way, to maybe learn from or lean on others experience or whatever. It's, I'm not advocating for like the lone ranger heading off to the wilderness to be a completely self-made man or woman because there's actually no such thing. All human, all humans, we all lean on others and and learn our values and our and our life and everything [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1683s) we all, we were inextricably part of systems and and of the influence of others.

But it's reminding you that you're not just a puppet on a chessboard that others get to move around. You have got choice and you have got agency. And whether you're Christian or not, you know, in my belief, when I look at the Bible, it's actually quite big on that individual agency as well. There's scriptures about how each one will be held to account or held [responsible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1713s) for the choices that I've made, all that kind of thing. There's a reasonable emphasis on the importance of the individual to choose and to believe for themselves.

And so yeah, whether you're Christian or not, I think when I think of that one little person, Cheryl, that you're mentioning and I'm thinking of a battery chicken that's, you know, just at the threshold of the door looking out into the big expanse and feeling paralyzed and scared and yeah, I just want to say to that little chicken, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1744s) do not need the battery cage to tell you how to scratch and flap your wings. You know, that is within you. And there's some, there's a mysterious thing there as well, just around, you just have to trust. You just have to trust.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1760s)

Yeah, you said something really prominent there with about staying curious. So how, I have a lot of fear. I've always had it. I mean, and especially now that I'm really unwinding a lot of what happened to me and in the cult is the fear is absolutely paralyzing even 30 years later. But the antidote to fear is stay curious within yourself and to know that when you leave, sometimes you're going to find out a lot of [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1790s) that you don't like in order to find what you do like.

When I left, I did, I tried a Catholic church, I tried multiple different churches, I tried, I was even at the United Church for probably about a year until I realized I had to always come back and check in with myself and be like, okay, this fits, but this doesn't fit. This fits over it, but this doesn't fit. It's like going to this clothing store and you're trying on clothing and you have to get used to knowing when you try something on [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1820s) then you got to drop in and be like, how does that feel to me?

And you'll notice when you do that, you always come through this bridge of fear, but if you can stay curious in your mind, eventually you will program through that fear that choice is available and you get to decide what I like, what I don't like. And then those likes can even change, right? Like I don't consider myself a religious person, I consider myself to be very spiritual. I am a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1851s) spiritual person that, I have a different way of looking at life and who I am beyond my 3D body that suits me, but it's not like I need to announce it to the world because it's mine. That's for me and for my way to journey on this planet. But when you come out, you have choice and that choice is you can go and do, in a month you could go through six different churches just [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1881s) find them out. You won't get judged for that. You literally do that.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1885s)

Yeah, and the difference there is that in my view, the brethren have chosen, you know, a set of clothes for you and they've chosen the length of the shirt and the haircut and everything as well as quite strict parameters. And they've, and not only have they chosen those clothes for you to wear, but they've also told you it's bad for you to choose for yourself and that you shouldn't trust yourself, that you are not going to be competent to do that and something bad is going to happen to if you choose for yourself.

So it's, I think a [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1915s) important first step is noticing that that is what's going on because until you can notice that and name that and actively reject that and go, actually, yeah, I am allowed to choose for myself, you'll probably, unless you take that step, you can kind of keep wanting to defer to thinking, oh no, I've got to do what they say. Whereas, so a really good first step is that one is acknowledging that, yeah, that it's not a sin. It's not a sin at all. It's not a bad thing to think for yourself, to [choose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1945s) for yourself and to have that wonder and curiosity towards thinking differently than what's being prescribed to you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1952s)

I mean, is it, is it going too far to say it's not just that you're allowed to choose for yourself, you're responsible to choose?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1960s)

Yeah, because...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1961s)

…what happens in the brethren is people will do actually wrong and wicked things because they've been told to do it by the brethren and they think that absolves them from responsibility for it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=1977s)

Do you want to share a couple of ministry quotes there Richard? You said you had some that maybe that show this kind of high level environment that we're talking about, high level of control. Yeah, I mean, it's just picking out a couple of them, hey? Like, like I can see that one right there around, I have to give up my own will, whatever program I've got, whatever career I've got, I abandon it. So that, yeah, that's that classic black and white brethren thinking of, yeah, just it's taking, you know, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2007s) taking concepts that are there in scripture like, you know, the bible does talk about leaving some things behind and and all that, but they take those kind of concepts and then make them really extreme, eh?

Like I don't know if you've got the quote there, but we used to hear in the meetings about this quote that said the assembly loves a broken man. And and and the whole concept of it was that the brethren love a person who's so [broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2038s) that they've completely given up their own ideas and will and they'll just surrender to whatever the assembly wants of them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2044s)

I think it's really important that we read these three out here. The quote says,

 "The key thing is to stay broken. We know what it was in youth to be broken and then to remain broken. It's our wills." JND refers to it, he says, "Our wills need to be smashed." He says, "And then they remain, they remain that way."

And then the next one says, 

"My own will has to be eclipsed by a superior will."

And then the next quote says is John Hales, so Bruce's father, going on and saying,

 "How long back does it go that you really trusted and believed in me? You won't find the way of more surpassing excellence unless you rigorously submit yourself to authority that is going to dominate you. Now who wants to be dominated? Very few. Very, very few want to be dominated. We want our young people to come to the idea of submission to a dominating authority almost from childhood."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2106s)

The extraordinary thing is that inside the Brethren, the words tyrant and despot are used positively. They're viewed as a positive word, which no one outside of the Brethren would even consider. So, I mean, here's one.

Despot. And this is, let's make it clear, this is Bruce Hales, who's the universal leader of the Brethren, has been for 20 years.

“It's a despot. It's one who has absolute authority over others. Whether we like that idea, whether we like the idea of coming under a dominating, strong, authoritative influence that's pure, that can be trusted.”

 And of course, he's talking about himself. He's not talking about God. He's emphasizing his own personal authority. And then then he [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2154s) another quote, 

"See it's when our wills have been smashed that's when we get our strength spiritually."

So I mean the idea of your will is an extremely negative idea, any expression of your will is a profoundly negative idea inside the brethren.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2172s)

Actually, you know how on social media sometimes we see quotes and we cross something out and we replace it with something and they go, we fixed it. I think that bottom one, if we change the ending, can be a very good descriptive of what spiritual abuse is encompassing, which is it's when our wills have been smashed, that's when we are at our most controllable. And that's the descriptive of what spiritual abuse at its core is about [control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2203s) And we know from, you know, not just cults, but, you know, torture camps as well, which is when somebody's whole entire sense of self and their whole will, their whole entirety of their being has been beaten down, smashed, manipulated, you know, all of those, that's when they're at their most controllable, that's when we've got you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2224s)

And so then they're the most useful to the assembly. Yeah, that's really interesting points. And and and again, this is what we're talking about. So to those people who have been smashed and been like, yeah, had their insides just torn apart where we're, we're, we're, I guess we're thinking of those people, hey, as we speak and we're encouraging them that to have an essence, a spark of your will and just and to not, you don't have to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2254s) it all in one day. It's going to be a long journey, but to start listening to that inner voice of yours, to start listening to your choice and your own agency, that that's a really good place to start, to start to believe that you could have a good will and a good sense of agency and to listen to that. That's a very first good step to take, yeah.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2280s)

And I think if you don't know what that inner voice is, you can still be curious and ask the question of whose voice is this, because in systems like that, your own inner voice is not fostered. And I'm very conscious that I'm talking about nervous system and we're talking about, you know, how am I responding to, you know, sitting in a different church or, you know, belief system or something like that and understanding your physical response and your body's responses to things and that emotions are physical [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2310s) just like I'm speaking Swahili to you because it's just so foreign in systems like this to even have any sense that your body is good, let alone that you can actually listen and learn from your body.

And so it's okay if you are coming out of that process of leaving and it seems pretty cognitive for the moment because you might not be able to access, you know, your [inherent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2340s) nervous system response, which is that's what we want to listen to, but we can't always access it straight away.

And sitting with the fact that trust is a spectrum, and I think we think that we need 100% trust. And that's how we got in this mess, is that 100% trust is never good. We never want that. We want appropriate levels of trust. And sometimes that inner self-trust can come with, when I'm working with people with religious trauma or in cult recovery, I go, let's start with a decision [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2379s) comes with minimal to no risk. So let's start with what ice cream flavor am I going to choose when I go to the shop and get two or get one and know that if you don't like it, that's the worst thing that's going to happen is you might have spent a few dollars and you don't like hokey pokey ice cream. And I'm using that example because I also don't like hokey pokey ice cream. But it's like, you know, it's just going with, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2409s) can make a decision and it not be an absolute disaster and it, it's getting your body used to making those decisions that you previously have never been allowed to make.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2420s)

Yeah, that's so important Sam. And I do remember that from my early months out as well. The people I lived with, they noticed I was having a really hard time choosing even small things because I was afraid of making the wrong decision. And so they would make me like do things like choose what to have for dinner. And it sounds crazy looking back, but I was in such a state that actually even doing that was really hard. And even last night, I had a meal with some ex-brethren and, you know, we were preparing the food and [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2450s) of them was concerned about cutting the tomato the wrong way. And it's like, actually, you know, yeah, these things don't matter, but it's such a good way to flex that muscle and start to grow it and it will come over time.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2466s)

Can I ask you a question then Sam, that I keep thinking about, very much part of my own experience, and that is how do we deal with the matter of conscience, what Christians call conscience, which is like your, well, I mean, they kind of treat it as if it's some inbuilt set of rules that is kind of implanted in your mind by God. But what I find in considering it is [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2496s) these rules have actually been implanted in my mind by *them* and that some of them are good and some of them are bad.

And you know, you get a terribly bad conscience about doing certain things, like for example, eating with someone who's not brethren. When I first left, although mentally I knew there was nothing wrong with it, you still felt bad when you sat down to eat. And then I started to think, well, you know, if I was being raised [an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2526s) orthodox Jew, I'd feel terrible about eating a pork sausage. And so just talk about the way these abusive religious systems manipulate that part of your mind that tells you what's right and wrong and how you overcome those very deep inhibitions that remain with you even when mentally you know that they're nonsense.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2551s)

I think largely we're talking about like the body's physical response to indoctrination. That's kind of what we're referring to. I think a lot of the time we think that indoctrination is just your brain, but that's not where it's staying. It's going into your system. And so in those situations and in any situation specifically, we can cognitively know something, but it doesn't mean that our body will not still respond to the thing that we're doing. And [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2581s) the difference between the abuse that happened or the indoctrination that happened and the trauma response in your physical body.

And in the same way that I give the example that somebody who has come back from war can be in the middle of a city and they hear a car backfire, but they instantly their body thinks that they are on the battlefield. And so they can cognitively know that they're in the middle of a city, but their body is responding to the sensory overload that's happening around them. And so the [easiest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2612s) answer I can say is that ideally you, we go to therapy to do some trauma processing around the physical response. But one of the simple things that I like to try and encourage my clients in particular to say is, is this situation uncomfortable or unsafe?

And those two situations are not the same thing. And if we stay unsafe, then the next question we can go is, do I feel unsafe or have I been told that this is [unsafe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2642s) And that can give us a different response as well. And if I've been told that, then we go, well, what do I think? That's when we go, what does my voice say? And and that's a very cognitive process because again, if we don't have access to our body, because ideally after some, you know, some somatic work of of getting in touch with what's happening in your body, I would refer back to that and I would go, how is your body responding to what's happening?

 [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2672s) if that's not accessible yet, we want to access all of the questions because all of the questions can lead us to sitting in that space of going, actually I've been told that this is unsafe, but if I look around at my environment, I don't actually think I am unsafe. And we sit with that cognitive dissonance that's happening. Ideally, we then want to be able to look at [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2703s) and process it in in some therapy, but that's also, you know, as a therapist, I know that's also not accessible to a lot of people. So I try to like have a little other things to do, but unsafe and uncomfortable is one of those things that can kick start a reflection internally for a lot of people in terms of where has this come from, as well as how is this feeling.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2727s)

That's incredibly helpful Sam, yeah, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2732s)

Is there a sense in which, where you know it's safe but you feel uncomfortable, you have to just kind of push yourself to become acclimatized to it? And you know, I mean, some traumas are so deep that it doesn't heal on itself. But in many cases, like the fear of eating with non-brethren, kind of push yourself in your comfort zone just to keep going out, to keep socializing. And that [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2762s) fade. Is that a reasonable thing to say?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2766s)

Yeah, I think a little caveat to that is what other support do you have at your disposal? In that, what like internal support in terms of how, if I have good skills to look after myself after this situation, then yeah, we might sit with being able to sit with the discomfort to and and it would be about working out at what point does this discomfort no longer feel tolerable? And at that point I [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2796s) say anything past that is not going to be helpful in any way, shape, or form. We always want to stay within that window of tolerance.

But do I have other external support as well? Do I have people that I can go back to, whether it be a therapist, whether it be support people, whether it be other peers who have also left the brethren? Do I have other people that I can debrief and decompress this situation with so that I'm not then sitting with it internally on my own with no [internal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2826s) or external support if I'm pushing those that comfort level?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2831s)

Yeah, because if we force ourselves too much and we come outside of that window of tolerance, we just reenact that trauma and threat response that's already happening in our body, right? Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2845s)

I think anything that, and if people don't know the the window of tolerance, I would encourage them to look it up. I think it would be really good information for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2853s)

I wasn't going to read this all out, but I do want to expand on the window of tolerance and due to streamline three blocking the insiders ability to be able to read what window of tolerance and get this type of information, I am going to read it out. So this is off of a Psychology Today website and it's called "What is the window of tolerance and why is it so important?" Developing a window of tolerance is especially critical for trauma survivors. And the key points in this specific article are the window of tolerance is a helpful and important nervous system regulation concept. Everyone's window looks a little [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2896s) depending on their personality, background, and a host of other factors.

“Expanding one's window of tolerance is often a critical task for relational trauma survivors. A clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine to describe the optimal emotional zone we can exist in to best function and thrive in everyday life. On either side of the optimal zone are two other zones, the hyperarousal zone and the hypoarousal zone. The window of tolerance, the optimal zone, is characterized by a sense of groundedness, flexibility, openness, curiosity, presence, an ability to be emotionally regulated, and a capacity to tolerate life's stressors.

If this window is eclipsed, if you experience internal or external stressors [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=2952s) cause you to move beyond and outside of it, you may find yourself existing in either a hyper aroused or hypo aroused state. Hyperarousal is an emotional state characterized by high energy, anger, panic, irritability, anxiety, hyper vigilance, overwhelm, chaos, fight or flight instincts, and startle response to name just a few characteristics.

Hypoarousal, by contrast, is an emotional state characterized by shutting down, numbness, depressiveness, withdrawal, shame, flat effect and disconnection, to name but a few characteristics.

Why is the window of tolerance so important? Put plainly, existing within the window of tolerance is what allows us to move functionally and relationally through the world. When we're within our window, we have access to our prefrontal cortex and executive functioning skills, organizing, planning and prioritizing complex tasks, starting actions and projects and staying focused on them to completion, regulating emotions and practicing self-control, practicing [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3032s) time management. Having access to our executive functions equips us to work, be in relationships, and problem-solve effectively as we move through the world, despite encountering hiccups, disappointments, and challenges.

When we are outside the window of tolerance, we lose access to our prefrontal cortex and executive skills and may default to taking panicked, reckless action or no action at all. We may be prone to self-sabotaging behaviors, gravitating towards [patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3063s) and choices that erode and undermine our relationships with ourselves, others, and the world. Clearly, then, it's ideal to stay inside the window of tolerance to best support ourselves in living the most functional, healthy life possible. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that all of us at every age sometimes eclipse our window of tolerance and find ourselves in a non-ideal emotional regulation zone sometimes.

That's normal and natural. So the goal here is not that we never eclipse our window of tolerance. I personally and professionally think that that's unrealistic. Rather, the goal is to expand our window of tolerance and to grow our capacity to rebound and be resilient, coming back to our window quickly and effectively when we find ourselves outside of it.

How do we increase our window of tolerance? I want to acknowledge that the window of tolerance is subjective. We each have a unique and distinct window depending on multiple biopsychosocial variables: our personal histories and whether or not we came from childhood trauma backgrounds, our temperaments, our social supports, our physiology, etc. No two windows will look exactly the same. Mine may not look the same as yours and so forth.

Because of this, I want to acknowledge that those who come from relational trauma histories may find that they have smaller windows than peers who come from non-trauma backgrounds. Those of us with childhood abuse histories may find too that we are more frequently and easily triggered and pushed outside of the optimal emotional regulation zone into hyper or hypoarousal. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3181s) is normal and natural given what we've lived through.

And everyone, whether or not they come from a relational trauma history or not, will need to work and expend effort to support themselves to stay inside their window of tolerance and will need to practice resiliency when they find themselves outside it. It just may mean those with relational trauma histories may have to work harder, longer and more deliberately at this. So again, recognizing that our windows are unique and we all need to invest effort into staying [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3211s) of it, how do we do this? In my personal and professional experience, this work is twofold. First, we provide ourselves with the foundational biopsychosocial elements that contribute to a healthy, regulated nervous system. Second, we work to cultivate and call upon a wide range of tools when we find ourselves outside of our window, which again is inevitable.

The first part of the work, providing ourselves with the foundational biopsychosocial elements that contribute to a healthy regulated nervous system may entail:

1. Providing our body with supportive self-care, getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, eating nutritious foods, refraining from substances that erode our health and being attending to emergent medical needs.  
2. Providing our minds with supportive experiences. This may include adequate amounts of stimulation, adequate amounts of focus and engagement, adequate amounts of rest and spaciousness and play.  
3.  Providing ourselves with supportive experiences of being in a connected relationship, of being connected to something bigger than ourselves. This could be spirituality, but can also be nature.   
4. Tending to our physical environment to set ourselves up for success. Living and working in places and ways that reduce stressors instead of increasing them. Designing the external environments of our lives to be as nourishing and not depleting as possible.

The second part of the work is how we practice resiliency and rebound when we find ourselves in hyper or hypo arousal zones. We do this work by developing practices, habits, tools, and internalized and externalized resources that help soothe, regulate, redirect, and ground ourselves. This article was written by Anne Wright and it was can be found on the psychologytoday.com [website.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3340s) I'll attach a link down below to the link to this article.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3344s)

We always want to stay within that window of tolerance because as soon as we hit outside of that, we're instantly in some form of trauma response and that's obviously not what we want and there is no, automatically at that point we are in that survival mode. Our nervous system thinks we are in survival mode and there is no learning in a survival mode. You are literally just surviving. So if we are hitting that point, if we are outside that window of tolerance, there's [no,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3374s) it kind of defeats the purpose of pushing that comfort line because now we're no longer actually absorbing anything that we're doing on a helpful basis.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3385s)

And that window of tolerance can change day to day, so which is another reason why it's super good to check in. I have a, I literally have something goes off, I have a reminder on my phone every day to check in with myself just to make sure that because when we get busy, we come across triggers that we don't even realize we're triggered because we're in this busy state and then something comes along, right? And then I end up in my therapist, you know, room and she's like, let's [let's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3415s) retrace your last week, let's retrace this because you would have had signs all the way through.

So when you have just a reminder on your phone to come up with like, let's just check in, how am I feeling? How am I feeling? You know, and when you research the window tolerance, it's like how much, I give my numbers are literally and I let my family know like my window of tolerance. I'm at about 20% today. So it's, you know, anything that comes out of this is nothing to do with any of you guys around you. It has to do [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3445s) what I'm dealing with, right? So it's a really good thing. And then you give yourself permission to just be sitting at a 20% of a window of tolerance. That's okay.

Everything that we go through and that we are, we are being triggered on matches the experiences that we have all gone through. And I think that's another big tool because we're so judged in the brethren that the judgment piece of our brain and brainwashing, if you want to call it that. And honestly, it's never left me and I'm like 30 some years out, right? So it's really, we're so apt to immediately go in and judge ourself [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3484s) how we're feeling or how we're think we're performing. And it's good to be able to offer yourself some grace and compassion and ask yourself, is what I'm feeling right now matching the experience that I have gone through? And immediately your body relaxes and you're like, yes it is. Then you can give yourself some grace and some compassion and some comfort versus forcing us to stand back up and perform the way that we were asked to perform while being [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3515s) the brethren, yeah.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3517s)

I think also in these like in closed communities, there is this notion particularly in trauma that we go back to our pre-traumatized self or our pre-trauma self. And when you are born into communities such as the brethren, that doesn't exist. You are indoctrinated from birth. You don't have a pre-indoctrinated self. And so it is less about getting back to something and more about creating something new, [knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3547s) that parts of that are still going to be there. And we want to give them different weight than they have always had in our system.

A little bit like, I bring up “Inside Out” as much as humanly possible as a movie and as a reference. A little bit like how, you know, it's just, it's another part of you. And do we want it driving the bus? No, not at all. We don't want it in front of the control panel at all. But is it still going to exist? [Probably.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3577s) We want to be able to navigate it and manage it. And there are going to be parts of that that are going to be far easier to heal and to grow from and to rewire and some that are not. But giving yourself permission for all of that to exist within you is really necessary because a little quote that I typically will use is that you don't just get to exterminate the shit that we don't like about [ourselves,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3608s) right? It's still there. We can learn the way that we hold it differently and we can rewire it, redefine it. It's why psychoeducation is such an important part of therapy. Understand it, understand the dynamics of what you have left, but it doesn't mean that those parts of you are just going to magically poof, disappear.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3628s)

I mean, I think one thing that makes it so difficult for many leavers from the brethren to deal with the spiritual trauma is that they're simultaneously going through the loss of everyone they've ever known and their family and their friends and their job. And it means that there's a real danger of becoming very, very socially isolated, particularly as you've got that built-in fear of interacting with anyone who's not a member of the brethren. So there's a danger of holing up in your bedroom and just cutting yourself off from the world. So it's really important to have to find, you know, at least [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3672s) person that you do feel comfortable with. And then if you've got that one person, they can, you know, if you've got a fear of eating with other people, maybe they can go with you. And so you've got some support. Is that the kind of thing you're saying?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3688s)

Yeah, absolutely. I think support looks different in different scenarios. But in terms of community, it's one of the biggest things that irrespective of the community that you have left, whether it be a stock standard good old-fashioned church or a cult, community is the deepest ache that most people experience leaving is the grief of that community because you know, there is the age-old quote that people don't join a cult, they join a group. And [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3718s) the belonging that is what keeps people in these spaces. We are as humans hardwired for connection. We need each other as people. And so support is what will get people through this process. No doubt. Yes, therapy is great. Yes, you know, regulations, skills and trauma processing is great. But if you are doing all of that on your own, it's going to be mighty, mighty hard. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3747s)

Let's talk about, let's go back to this judgment piece. How would you help people who are trying to leave that have witnessed the ambush of priestly visits, love bombing, the horrendous tsunami of the attacks that come after saying, you know, you've lost your way, you're going to go to hell. We need, you need to come. You need to, you need to convert you again. And like, how do you, how do you get past that ambush of judgment that you feel and actually [make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3777s) it out of there?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3781s)

Yeah, I've got a couple of thoughts on that. I think the main thing is, again, coming back to this agency thing that we've been talking about, because I think, and again, I'm going off my personal experience here, at the time when I was going through the leaving thing, and priests were coming around and visiting with me, you know, as a single young female, and it would be two older men and that, you know, a huge power dynamic and all of that, I never crossed my mind that I had a choice to say [no.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3811s) It never once crossed my mind.

And I would love to get that home to all the current brethren's minds or those who are in that process of leaving is that again, you have a choice. You do not have to engage. And yes, there might be sometimes when that choice is taken away from you if somebody's like right in front of your face or whatever and you don't have the choice, but I reckon nine times out of ten, more often than you realize, you have a choice around, around yeah, how [much,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3842s) around where your boundaries are.

So learning, you can look up, there's so much stuff online around boundaries and being assertive and that kind of thing. But again, you're going to have to go do that mental shift of believing that you don't have a choice and that everyone else gets to determine what happens to you and how they engage with you. Shift your mind back again to going, I have agency here, I have choice. You can block every single one of them if you want on on your phone or whatever. You can refuse to meet them in person. [If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3872s) your home environment is unsafe, you do have a choice to leave that home environment and to find a safe place.

And you do not have to give your address and you do not have to agree to seeing anybody. And there's additional security things you can do there to help keep you safe, like whether it's putting up a security camera so you know who's at the door or who might be snooping around your property, like there are little things you can do like that as well to help enforce those boundaries. If you feel you're being [followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3903s) or harassed, you can also, you know, if it gets to it, you can notify police in most countries and take out protection orders against people who are, you know, if you believe that they're harassing you. But yeah, I think really it comes back to that thing again of choice. And if you don't feel up to engaging with priests or family members, give yourself time out. You can choose to come back to them as well if you really want to.

Like for example, family members, you might think, well I actually do want [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3933s) have the chance to face to face say goodbye to them or whatever. But again, you have choice. You don't have to let them set that and determine that and have a scene where they all come and press you or whatever, you can say, you know, I'm going to meet you for one hour at a neutral location. Don't go onto their property. It can be thinking about those power dynamics that can help of going, actually, no, I'm going to meet you in a cafe or in a public park, not on your property because there's a power dynamic there. And [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=3964s) a hugely helpful thing can be to have an advocate, somebody on the outside, somebody who's a trusted person for you.

And you know, sometimes it's best if it's not another ex-brethren so there's not that prickly layer of, oh my gosh, she's connected to so-and-so's auntie now or whatever. To have somebody who's an unknown quantity to them, you know, maybe you have got a lawyer friend or a police friend or someone who does know what's what and say, you know, I'm going to be at this place with my support person and we'll talk and say goodbye then or, you know, I'll answer your questions then, but I will have my [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4002s) person and I will be recording the conversation and I'll meet with you for 45 minutes. You know, you have choice, you have agency, use it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4013s)

Yeah, yeah, another practical thing is because of course you probably do want to have a line of communication, particularly with family members in case there's a disaster or anything, is to is to appoint an intermediary. So you say to them, well, if you want to contact me, if you need to contact me, send a message to so and so and they will pass it on to me. And that stops the kind of the ambushing tactics that they will use.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4040s)

Oh, that's such an important idea, Richard, and it can really help with the trauma response thing too because I know I used to have a huge physiological response if I saw a letter with my mother's handwriting on it in the letterbox.

It didn't happen very often, but when it did come, I was always dreading what was in it and would feel that panic and that fear of how is this going to hurt me? How is the contents of this letter going to hurt me this time? And so for a long time, I had others open them for me and then share with me as to any particularly important bits in there, but they would help shield me from the more painful stuff. That's a great idea, Richard. And yeah, whether it's a physical letter or an email address, having an intermediary, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4087s) an excellent idea.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4087s)

And I think part of their tactics that they use is using our family against us. And I think one of the biggest things that have that worked for for myself and the people that I've helped leave is that it's important to understand and have a separation between your love for your family that will never go away. You will, that will never die off. You will always love your family, but you also have to understand that when you're having these conversations [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4118s) arguments and these battles and ambushes from your family, it's not really your family. These are indoctrinated people that are following requests of what they think they need to do. It's two separate things. And that's how you can detach a little bit of your heart from the situation and realize that when they're throwing very hurtful things at you, it's not really them. This is the indoctrination speaking. It's not really the family that loves [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4148s) speaking.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4150s)

Yeah, I think when I think about it, three things come to mind. The first obviously being support, in that we want to interrupt whatever narrative is coming at us. And whether that's emotional support or somebody who can literally help us sit down and go, that's not what is happening, that's not what this is. And that probably connects to the second thing that I think is psychoeducation. It is such a key part of cult recovery and it is a key part because what it does is it [names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4180s) what is happening. They are not being caring and trying to get us go to go back to the community, they're love bombing us, they're manipulating me, they are overpowering me, they are whatever it is that's happening. Naming it can help us separate what is happening versus what they are telling us is happening and what you've always been taught is happening.

And the third thing is probably a more of a, you can do this at any point with no one around. And this is more about, I guess, connecting to yourself and that self-talk, which is something super simple is being able to like, just hand on heart. I am allowed to feel afraid, but I am also allowed to make a choice, right? And so like the hand on heart is just about connecting to yourself and saying whatever it is that you need to hear in that moment [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4233s) saying it audibly, not internally. If we can say it audibly, we are hearing it internally, but we are also hearing it audibly and it's accessing two different parts of us. But we need some sense of grounding in that moment and you might not know how to do that, but you have the ability to put your hand on your heart and say, what do I need right now? And do that. And it might not feel like it in the moment like it's doing absolutely anything, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4264s) if you are able to do it repeatedly, you will start to feel the impact. It is a very simple way to ground and and get a sense of where your nervous system is at.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4276s)

Okay, let's let's dive into exploring spirituality without dogma.

And spirituality as a personal experience, rather than a book of rules. Can you expand on that, either Sam or Lindy?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4292s)

Yeah, that is, I mean, again, I want to jump to define some terms, like people often use the term spiritual or spirituality as being different from religion. And just kind of, you know, generally speaking my understanding of it is of the difference that people tend to hold is that usually religion is associated with more institutional forms of spiritual belief and it's often, yeah, often more associated as well with some long-standing historical or traditional forms [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4322s) religion as well. Probably particularly in the countries the brethren are in, it's obviously Christianity. Yeah, whereas often people use the term spiritual or spirituality to describe more their their own experience or beliefs of of divine or non-tangible beings without it necessarily being connected to a communal or a group or organized kind of religion.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4352s)

Can I just broaden that out a little bit to say, not necessarily beings, but even sometimes you get this, sometimes you just have a moment when the, particularly in connection with the natural world, you just have a moment when you are completely overawed by the complexity and the beauty of everything we're connected with. And that's a spiritual experience [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4382s) you realize you're in touch with something that's so vast and complex you could never possibly understand it and yet at the same time you are actually in touch with it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4393s)

Yes, that's a very spiritual experience.

Yeah, I love that you use the word awe there Richard, awed or whatever, because I think that those feelings of awe are often really deeply connected to spiritual or religious experience. And yeah, this thing of, oh man, there's something bigger than me and that's beyond me, but that somehow I'm connected to it and that I'm part of it.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4419s)

I think connection is the key word there, Lindy. I think spirituality is about connection. And like music can be spiritual, art can be spiritual, nature is spiritual, and it's about you being connected to whatever it is, the core of you being connected to whatever that other form of connection, whether it be, you know, a divine being or whether it be a piece of music or something that you are listening to. We are all inherently [spiritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4449s) beings at our core, whether irrespective of whatever religion we practice or don't practice.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4455s)

Yeah, and I think that's the, if we go back to the brethren context, that's where it gets interesting again, because again, it's like they have set themselves up as an institution, as a religion. They have set themselves up to be the mediators and the controllers of their members' spirituality. And that's again where I think it's gone problematic. And again, I've got no problem with [positive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4486s) spiritual communities or positive forms of ritual or tradition there. And, you know, let's be honest, in our wide, wonderful world, there are some incredible religious institutions or groups where people genuinely have good, positive experiences that are healing and fulfilling.

And so I think, yeah, I mean, I've connected a little bit with something like Recovering from Religion, which is a resource that you might want to put in the in the notes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4516s) guys, but they and they have got some really good stuff, but their founder, from what I've heard from his talks, he is a bit more towards the way of actually, you know, all religion should be abolished, it's all harmful. Whereas my personal opinion is that actually, I know from myself as well as people around me and and engaging with different things all around the world, it can be really positive and wonderful. And so I, for one, am trying to navigate that walk of finding out, okay, what is it that's [harmful?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4546s)

And what is it that's good and beautiful? And can I find ways to kind of identify both, increasing my discernment, I guess, as I go through life of, where's the good stuff? And I'll celebrate that and lean into that. And where's the stuff that actually, oh, no, that's getting controlling or that's getting weird and and actually I'm not okay with that.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4569s)

I think there can be safe faith spaces, but I think as soon as we throw the word organized in front of religion, that's where we become, that's where we get an issue. Anything, anything that is faith, belief, spirituality based that has organized on top of it automatically is going to create systems of power and system and and rules as well. And anytime we put someone who thinks that they have any sort of [authority](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4599s) in a divine sense or in a spiritual sense, and we see that in not just, you know, divine beings, but in religious leaders in those spaces, as soon as we put organized in front of that, that's where we get systemic harm, I think, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4617s)

Well, I would push back a little bit there and just say we, like people organize themselves, you can't help it. You know, with any, any, any entity or any group, we've often got either explicit or not, you know, cultures and codes of conduct and and more often than not, it is explicitly written down or whatever, particularly with groups that are religious. And again, I just don't think it always means it's going to be bad. The same, same with leaders. I think just because we put someone in a position [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4647s) leadership, it doesn't inherently mean that they're going to be bad. It does inherently mean there's a power dynamic. I completely agree with you there.

And that is really important to name that, yeah, if we appoint someone as a leader and the same thing if we choose to sign up to a to an organization of any form, it's acknowledging that, it's acknowledging it, isn't it, that that they are going to have some form of, there's going to be a reciprocal relationship here of influence and just [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4677s) aware what, what are the power dynamics here? And so for for me, some of the safeguarding questions, I liked your thing there around, you know, can there be safe faith spaces, that's a tongue twister, yeah, and how do we, and if so, yeah, how do we identify them? How do we keep ourselves safe if we want to explore those kinds of groups or communities?

And I would also say this is important whether you're joining, you know, yeah, a local gym or a yoga class or any any other form of [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4707s) group that's organized around spirituality or religion or anything as well. It's just common sense stuff like, can I ask questions? Yeah, am I, do I feel that I'm being pressured in any way to do anything with my time or my finances or my resources? Yeah, is there transparency with what they're doing with money?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4731s)

What happens if you try to leave is an interesting question.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4736s)

It's such an interesting question. Yeah, what happens if you try to leave? And then, just putting it into Google and going, I do this all the time with with groups, just going, yeah, whatever it is and then putting controversy. Just see if something comes up, some obscure news article or something where, oh boom, yep, you know, because often what comes up if you just put in a group name, often it will be their website and their social media and their glorious lovely [fronts,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4766s) whereas if you put in something like controversy as well, then often you'll get the underbelly articles that that show you the underside of it.

And you can, like I said, you know, you can do this for gyms or a yoga class or anything. It's best to be diligent and be careful with whatever group you're joining. And yeah, if there's some former members, talk to them if you can find former members, check in with them, see why they left. Yeah, so there's things you can do to definitely to [make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4796s) yourself more safe. But jumping back to the spirituality and religion thing, you know, religious groups, yes, there can be terrible harm in them, but they can be wonderful good. And why, in my opinion, why people join them is again, like any group, because of the good that they find there. There are some organized religious groups that do foster a healthy spirituality and a healthy sense of belonging and there are many ex-brethren who have found [such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4826s) communities.

You know, they might be able to provide you with some tips and pointers as well. If I was leaving all over again, and it's sort of what I did I guess 15 or so years ago, but I found it so helpful to talk to a diversity of leavers. Talk to some of the fundy Christian ones, talk to the some of the more mainstream ones, talk to the atheist, talk to the one who went and explored Wiccan spirituality and new age, like talk to them all, open your mind and be...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4855s)

curious, remain curious. Yeah, curiosity.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4858s)

Yeah, yeah, stay curious. Use it as part of your discernment around, yeah, is this me? Is this what I believe to be true? Yeah, I think as well for people who do want to remain Christian but are also feeling really confused or hurt by the fact that the bible or God has been used to hurt them so much, there's so many resources out there as well that can help you in that journey. I know for one, ICSA, International Cultic [Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4889s) Association, if you go to their website, they've got like a whole other branch or a whole other website. It's a whole branch of ICSA called SAR, which is Spiritual Abuse Resources.

There's loads of resources there. I think as well, for me, when I look at the Bible, I see so many stories of power and control and spiritual abuse and betrayal and manipulation all through it. Like it's actually a very unholy book of, you know, all sorts of tales of horror. And a lot of it is around religious, you know, the use and name of God to do all sorts of [things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4933s) And I think even when you look at the life of Jesus himself, it's very clear all through the Gospels. It's a fight between, you know, the religious leaders of the day and their power and domination and control over people and society.

And it clearly sets up Jesus as the protagonist against these powers and forces. So these battles that we're fighting and talking about today are all through the Gospels, they're all through the New Testament. There's nothing new there. You know, same with Paul going around killing people because he didn't like what they were believing. Or on a slightly lesser level, in Romans 14, the believers, they were both believers, [having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=4981s) battles over whether you could eat meat or not, whether it was unclean. And they were obviously having huge wars over it.

And then Paul the apostle's trying to like tell them all to just chill out and actually it's okay to be a believer and eat meat and it's okay to be a believer and not eat meat, but just stop, stop attacking each other over it. And I love that as well because it reminds me again, the brethren mindset was so black and white with this is one way to believe, there's one way [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5011s) follow God, there's one way that you have to dress and live your life and interpret scripture. Whereas even in scripture itself, they're interpreting things differently and following God with different emphases and and that's okay.

So to those who want to find a Christian faith again, stop looking for the black and white answer. Stop looking for the one right church that you're going to join that's got everything perfect. [Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5041s) trying to sew your theology into a neat little box and tie it up with string because you can't do that with God. You can't do that with this glorious, messy humanity that we find ourselves part of. And instead, you know, yeah, just know that, know that you can follow God still out here without everything all sewed up and there's just a huge diversity of what it means to be a Christian and what it means to know, [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5072s) be a spiritual being and that's okay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5075s)

I think people who, when they're facing up to leaving the brethren or when they realize that the brethren system is, you know, corrupt, it's like they've been standing on this rocky island in the ocean and they don't know how to swim. And suddenly they find the island sinking and they think they're just going to sink to the bottom of the ocean. And I would say, no, you're going to learn to swim. It's fine to swim. It's fine to rock with the waves and [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5105s) change all the time. Just learn to swim.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5107s)

Oh, that's a really beautiful picture, Richard. I really like that because again, it speaks to that black and white thinking, right? It's the brethren mindset that says if the brethren go under, my salvation's gone, my morality's gone, it's going to be, you know, I'm going to be a reprobate piece of chaos. But actually, oh my gosh, that's a lie. That that comes from that black and white indoctrination. It is simply not true. You can learn to swim and you will learn to swim and you're going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5137s) be okay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5138s)

I mean, the other thing that I keep thinking about, you notice that when people leave the brethren, they go in, you know, 180 degrees of different directions. I mean, some become very firm atheists and some go to, you know, some become just one thin sheet of paper removed from regular Plymouth Brethren doctrine and there's every scale in between. And I kind of think [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5168s) it, I was trying to sort of think of an analogy for this.

And I was thinking, well, if you buy a packet of mixed seeds, all the seeds look the same. You tip them into your hand, they're all small and brown and wrinkly. And then you put them into the ground and water them. And then one comes up and it's a brussel sprout and one's an oak tree and one's a bunch of roses. And the fact is inside the brethren, it's just this production line where they pop people off the mold. I mean, they're like a flock of penguins. They all look identical. They have to have name tags so you know [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5198s) actually individuals.

And then when you release that artificial constraint, their genuine personality, what they really are, emerges and you don't know. I mean, even the person themselves doesn't know what they're going to turn into. You know, like the caterpillar that goes into its cocoon, it doesn't know that it's going to be a butterfly. And so you get this huge diversity.

And, you know, there's this problem in the ex-brethren community that they kind of look at each other and say, well, look, you've got flowers, but you're a, you know, you're a pumpkin. Something's wrong here. No, it's people actually being themselves. And that's really the liberty we have.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5241s)

Yeah, and that's such a beautiful and wonderful thing to see and to celebrate. Yeah, I think another thing I'd add in there, Richard, is that oftentimes when you look at it, what people are doing, wherever they end up, strident atheist or fundamental Christian, whatever, most of the time people are just trying to make themselves safe. And people are trying to, they're trying to find a framework and a worldview to help them to cope with their trauma [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5271s) this horrible roller coaster that they found themselves on, spat out the other end. And yeah, really behind it all, people are looking, looking for and have found frameworks and perspectives that make sense to them and help them make sense of the landscape that they've found themselves in. And really, most of us have got far more in common than we have to separate us.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5297s)

It was kind of like a home. Everyone's home is different. You have a different taste in furniture and curtains and decor. Why would you point to someone else's home and say, I don't like your wallpaper? You're not living there. Let people live in their own spiritual space where they're comfortable and yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5314s)

And do your thing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5316s)

And don't worry so much about other people, you know.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5320s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5321s)

Do you think Sam, that that is one of the hardest things to get to deconstruct when people are born into a cult though, is that when they get out to learn how to use their wings, learn how to to allow other people to use their wings? Because especially with the brethren, where it's grown up to be, it's such a judgmental environment and yeah, like and how do you navigate that?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5347s)

Slowly, slowly is the first word that comes to mind. Because it is, you've, like every version that you start to become, you've never been that version before, right? So learning is the key word here. And you've, you know, to sort of go back to that learning to swim analogy, you've also never been taught to swim in this scenario. So now it's no wonder you feel like you're drowning. You've never been taught to swim and now [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5377s) are having to learn to swim.

And so it's why self-compassion is such a cornerstone part of trauma recovery because we have to go, I'm learning, I've never been this version of myself before and I'm doing the best I can with what I have, which is really, really fucking limited, right? So it's self-compassion is so important. But it goes back to in terms of like the whole concept of like, who am [I,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5407s) what do I like, what is spirituality to me, what do I want to believe, what values do I have? All of that is coming back to the word that, you know, keeps coming up in this episode, which is choice, right? Conformity, which, you know, the brethren is based upon, is rooted in compliance. And authenticity, which is what everybody is trying to aim for, is rooted in choice. It's coming back to curiosity and choice will lead you to authenticity.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5435s)

And would you say that people who are born into a system like that, and after leaving, that there's many layers of this healing, many layers of learning how to swim could be like 40 years later, still learning something, still like 30 some years later, and I'll try something new for the first time. And I feel like I should, I don't deserve to be having this new experience. It still pops up for me. And I mean, I make note of it, and it goes on my list for my next therapy session. But it is, [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5465s) you say that that is something that maybe we learn how to unravel that, deconstructing everything even years later?

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5473s)

Yeah, some of these situations, even if they are happening 40 years down the track, you might not have ever learned that. And so you might not have ever experienced it. But that inherent broken aspect is coming back to, I think, typically the theology that you are taught and indoctrinated with in that we are inherently not good at our core, we are inherently sinful and broken at our core. And so that's typically where I find [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5504s) lot of the the lack of deserving, the lack of ability, the lack of being able to do things typically comes back to. It's not always that, but it can be.

But yes, it is, I use the, I use the Shrek analogy, Shrek and Donkey with the onions. Like we are just always peeling back layers upon layers. Some are thicker than others. Some are wafer thin. But whether it's thick or thin, it's [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5534s) a layer and it's still movement and it's still something that you can learn and something that you get to uncover about yourself and about what life looks like now.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5548s)

Can you say something about the fact that we are all born essentially agnostic and that nearly everybody who belongs to a particular religion, their parents also belong to it? I mean the reason I'm talking about that is that in part of the deconstruction you say, well, why do I believe all these things? And the answer is usually because that's what my parents taught me. And then I kind of, another thought process I go through as I think of that [brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5579s) in the meeting who was particularly fervent and particularly active and I kind of think, I bet if he had been born into a Muslim family, he would be a very fervent Muslim.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5590s)

Yeah, I think irrespective of religion, even when it comes to, you know, questions around gender and beliefs and values and, you know, thoughts about sexuality and health and all of that sort of thing, who you are raised with has like a fundamental aspect of who you become. It's why I added the caveat at the beginning when Lindy was talking about spiritual abuse or like happening in religious context, it also happens in family [context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5620s) because that's predominantly where children do a lot of their learning.

It's they, and sometimes learning, but sometimes absorption in terms of they just take it on because they don't have any other choice. But I think in terms of like exploring that and pulling that apart, it's just a shit ton of questions and a question upon a question upon a question upon a question because that's what gets you to yours, [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5651s) what gets you to like, this is now my voice, not the voice that I heard growing up. And coming back to things like morals and values exist outside of religion and outside of what you have been told and you get to decide what those look like and what those sound like.

And I mean, obviously like if I'm working with somebody, I'm also wanting to line that up with, well, if we audibly say this statement out loud, how does your body respond to that? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5681s) we and working with that, but that's obviously really tricky to start with. And so it's just, it's pulling it apart, it's teasing it out, like it's just a consistent, like the image that's coming to mind is just like a never-ending bag of fairy floss that we are just teasing and teasing and teasing and teasing until we get to something that we think is ours. Yeah, and that can take a really long time.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5711s)

Being indoctrinated from childhood, there's a lot of things that we tend to think are like self-evident, absolute truths, like, you know, just like we would think about the force of gravity and so on. But you really have to challenge yourself and say, why do I believe this? And often it's not a fundamental or self-evident truth at all. It's just the way we've been raised and brainwashed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5736s)

It's learning critical thinking skills, right? And it really comes down to when you allow yourself to have that curiosity and to play with life after you leave and not be put, not put yourself in such a black and white box. You start developing critical thinking skills. It's what the one thing that is so squished in there is this ability to critically think. And because the critical thinking is so squashed, all of these other habits [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5766s) out of it. So I challenge everybody who leaves is to when you come out, really open your eyes. Give yourself that. I mean, I have sticky notes still 30 years later all over my house. And it is like constantly putting up new ones of what I'm reprogramming still in my brain. Because my brain needs to still learn how to stand up for itself and think for itself.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5790s)

Yeah, I think that thinking critically thing is awesome. And like the curiosity and wondering thing that we've mentioned, you know, that doesn't mean for the critics out there who are like might be allergic to the concept, it doesn't mean believing everything and it doesn't mean being silly with going out and trying all sorts of things or, you know, there are some things in this crazy world that actually are better to not know much about or better to not engage with. There's some crap out there as well, like we know that. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5820s) we're not encouraging people to just like be really understanding and go wild with trying everything. It's it's about, yeah, learning, learning to discern, eh, between what again, that your inner voice of what, what is good and what is bad, instead of just relying on the brethren to set that for you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5838s)

And you'll know when something is fundamentally something you shouldn't be trying, right? Again, critical thinking, when you get into that critical thinking, you know what I'm like, there's things that I will never try in my life because I don't want that a part of my life. Right. So you with critical thinking comes discernment. And it's not just this wild, abandoned discernment that has no boundaries to it. Your body will tell you, your soul speaks to you. You're [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5868s) left alone in this. You are connected to something much greater than you that can guide you into a very peaceful life if you allow it. And choice gives you that.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5879s)

Yeah, critical thinking and curiosity gives you choice. It's like the triple power of C's. Like it's, you know, that combo is everything that you don't have in high control environments. You don't have the ability to be curious. You don't have the ability to think critically. You don't have choice. And so they're the three cornerstones of what is going to be powerful in being able to access who am I and who [am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5909s) I going to be navigating the world as an individual and as a good human.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5916s)

Yeah, Sam has to scoot out here, so I just want to thank you so much Sam for taking your time to come on here and really dive into a subject that's been near and dear to our hearts and wanting to put on a podcast. So thank you Lindy for setting us up with her and I really, really appreciate you coming on. Thank you. Thanks so much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5937s)

Sam, it's brilliant.

### [**Sam Sellers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5939s)

It's been my absolute pleasure. Thank you all. Take care.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5943s)

And we look forward to hearing, we'll share about the Religious Trauma Collective's online event. We'll be sharing about that. So look forward to seeing you again then.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5953s)

Amazing. Thanks, guys. Take care, love. After leaving the brethren, I mean, we've got three heads here. How do you think it is possible to become more tolerant of belief systems that might not align to our belief system? Because I think that is one of the biggest things post leaving, as again, we're coming back to that judgment thing, but also being tolerant, having humility when it comes to allowing people around [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=5983s) to have all different variations of faith.

Because that's, that's really what we want people to realize inside there, that there's such a variety, there's a rainbow, a variety of faith levels, different faiths, different beliefs that you can have a choice to engage yourself with, right? Like it is your choice on what you want to believe. But coming out of there, and all of us have gone through this, how do we become more tolerant [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6013s) the different beliefs that are around us?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6018s)

Well, everyone believes in something, right? I mean, some people are, some people believe in science and evolution and the big bang and it's a very rational belief and that's fine. Others believe in very esoteric religious ideas with, you know, real live guardian angels and spirits and demons and, and you know, if maybe you're like Bruce Hales and you just believe in money. [Well,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6048s) I mean, that's all fine.

Everyone believes in something.

Of course, the brethren believe that their belief system is the truth and no one can believe in anything else. But surely, having come out of a system like that, we should have the common sense and the tolerance and the humility to understand that belief and religion and your worldview, however you want to put it, that's personal. That's your personal choice. It's your personal area. And [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6085s) your own personal choice to whether you decide to share that with anyone else or whether you keep it to yourself. And so just respect the fact that you have left a belief system, which you have now recognized is wrong, and have respect for other people's belief systems, even if you don't believe in them yourselves.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6109s)

Yeah, I think to me, it comes back again to something we've talked about a bit in this podcast, where the brethren worldview is so black and white. It's so dichotomous. It's so like in and out, wrong and right. And so I think growing up in there, we did not learn what tolerance was. It was like, well, there's my way and then there's the wrong way, you know? And and so we, and along with that came a superiority and which in [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6139s) ways that's kind of a natural outcome, you know, like if if I really believe in veganism, I'm, it's because I believe that eating meat is wrong and that I've chosen a higher path, you know, like it kind of, it's very difficult to believe, to stop superiority kind of creeping in when you start believing that you've found the right way or the right path.

I think you have to work really hard at that humility and openness to possibly being wrong or to continuing [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6170s) have respect for others who live or believe differently, regardless of of their beliefs, just acknowledging that they have an inherent value as a human being.

Yeah, so I think, again, part of learning to be more tolerant is acknowledging that black and white brethren worldview that you've come from and kind of deconstructing that. Yeah, from that place, you can realise, oh, wow, others have got a lot to teach me and that maybe I'm not so wise and wonderful and right as I thought I was.

And, yeah, coming back to that openness and curiosity of what can I learn from others? And you'll be fascinated if you do, because you'll learn incredible things if you talk with others and ask them about their beliefs and why they hold them. Whether it's, as you've said, Richard, in science or in guardian angels or in ghosts. There's some amazing stories out there that can really open your eyes if you choose to engage instead of just staying on your thing of like, [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6233s) got my beliefs and they're right and no one can shift me on that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6237s)

The stereotyping, and I mean, this is a problem in society at large as well. I mean, just to share a story, I worked for two years in Toronto in a very, very large bakery, managing quite complex machinery that was producing biscuits at a very high rate. And it involved a lot of on the job training and learning from people who were already there. And of course, being a food production facility in Toronto, it was almost entirely, nearly everyone was an immigrant [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6267s) they were every color of the rainbow. I don't think I saw any green people there, but it wouldn't have surprised me to see some.

But the people who were specifically training me that I was working with closely every day were Bangladeshi Muslims and very devout Muslims. And of course, being raised in the brethren, I had a lot of prejudices about what Muslims were and, you know, how repressed the women were and how nasty they were. And you couldn't have had nicer, more friendly people. I mean, it was an older [man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6298s) and, you know, he was in his 60s. He was very devout and you would see him, you know, you would see him pause at his work and say his prayers at the proper time. He would just shut his eyes, you'd see his lips moving. He wasn't actually getting on the floor kneeling, but very devout.

And of course, when it was Ramadan, as soon as the sun set, they all rushed off to get something to eat. They'd been starving themselves all day. So I would take my turn manning the machine so they could go and grab a sandwich.

And the other one who worked with him was his niece, who was a young married Muslim woman who had two children. Her husband also worked in the factory and she wore her hijab. You know, she wouldn't let her hair be seen. She wore hijab all the time. But if anyone had a stereotype about the Muslim woman being terribly repressed, this person, if there was any fun or activity or naughtiness going on, this young lady was in the middle of it with a lot of laughter.

And the older man found out that I was, he, you know, when there was a pause between production, we would sit and just look stuff up on the computer, and he saw me reading the Bible on the computer, and he came to talk to me about it, and he said, it's very interesting, I've been reading John's Gospel, and he says, I think the Bible is entirely equivalent to the Quran, and he was talking about the, you know, the similarities there were between them, and it just blew away out of my mind, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6386s) of the stereotypes you have about a certain religion or a certain class of people, because these were genuinely happy, lively people that had very fulfilling lives. And, you know, I'm not a Muslim, but it's very, very, it's very much a feature of brethren upbringing to have zero tolerance and a negative stereotype about every other race, religion, belief.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6414s)

That's outside of what we were taught. Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6421s)

Yeah, I think so much of the journey after or before leaving the brethren, but after leaving and processing some of this spiritual abuse and religious trauma is is around all that stuff, isn't it? It's of identifying the beliefs that were actually harmful and had a negative impact on you with how you relate to the rest of the world.

And, you know, for you in that situation, it was realizing, wow, I have believed that Muslims or people of other ethnicities are lesser than me or, yeah, not so happy or intelligent or fulfilled or don't, that, you know, they couldn't possibly have any good spirituality in them and yet you were witnessing kind of all of the above and that was blowing your preconceived notions out of out of the water. Yeah, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6480s) think that happens a lot, eh, when you leave the brethren.

It's a bit of a jump, but I'm thinking about Jilly Jenkinson's Walking Free workbook that she has, which I really recommend to our listeners. It's called Walking Free from the Trauma of Coercive Cultic and Spiritual Abuse. And so it's got like quite a range there and she very systematically walks through a whole lot of kind of milestones that you have to reach in the road to recovery. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6510s) she's got a really helpful term that she calls introjects. And for her, there are these beliefs that the culty group has actually put into your mind, has instilled into your mind or your psyche.

Around, they might be beliefs about God or about yourself or about others, but I think that's the key point is that they've come from the culty group and they're given to you to eat and take into your system and you often end [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6540s) believing they are yours or that they're really part of you. Whereas she says that part of the recovery journey is kind of, you know, pulling those things out in a way and chewing on them again and going, okay, is this, is this actually something I want to take with me going forward? Is this something that's inherent to me or actually does it completely belong to the brethren or the group and it's got nothing at all to do with, you know, it's not something that I want in my future?

Like I remember when I left, I was really terrified [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6570s) going to the movies because, you know, back then it was like that was a really wicked thing to do. And I think there was something about, you know, that if the rapture came when you were in the movies that you'd get left behind.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6584s)

And you've got a rapture proof ceiling in the cinema.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6588s)

Very tough ceiling, yeah. And I remember having to like really name that and go, actually, I no longer believe that's true. And you know, that's a more minor example, but there's some much bigger things that we can take on as you know, like things like, oh, I can't leave and keep my salvation or if I become an atheist, I'm destined to be like a completely evil, reprobate, worthless human being, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6618s) know? But it's going, actually, that there is a belief that's come from the brethren and it's come from their worldview and it might not be true at all and it might not be true for me. So it can be a long process, but it's a very important process to do that thing of picking out these introjects and deciding what, what is it that you're going to keep and what is it that you're going to reject and throw back to the group.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6643s)

And to know that you can have an atheist friend and a Christian friend and you all get along because each person is in their belief that suits them. It doesn't come down to fighting on beliefs, which is what has been indoctrinated into us. It comes down to having tolerance and understanding that everybody has the beliefs they need in order to make themselves feel safe and be a productive human in society. And that's [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6674s) okay. It doesn't matter what each person believes, as long as those beliefs are not harming another person.

Right, when we come into even just my own personal experience in the church, right, like their beliefs were allowing them and giving them permission to do horrible things with me as a child, right? So when we come and we're talking about everybody having their beliefs, we're not excusing beliefs that are harmful to other people, but there is in society this opportunity and this choice to have [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6704s) own belief and have it as your own that you don't need to give away to anybody else. And you can love a person beside you that has the opposite beliefs, but you still come together, there's still unity there.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6717s)

Yeah, which and some of that's a control thing again, because I think in the brethren, we believed, you know, we had to police everyone around us and their actions and their thoughts as well. Whereas it's letting go of that as well. It's going, actually, I'm not responsible for the person next to me, their choice. I can, you can still try and influence people, you know, like like I said before, if I really believe in veganism, I'm probably going to sing that the praises of veganism to people around me and try and influence them that way just because [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6747s) believe it's good for the planet or the cows or for me or whatever. And that's okay, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna like cut off or judge or ostracize people who are going, no, I really want my meat, leave me alone. And it's still having a base level of respect and acceptance for others, even if they choose differently, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6765s)

Yeah. And I guess the other thing is you don't have to subscribe to anyone else's belief system at all. I mean, in reality, every individual has a slightly different belief system, even if they all belong to the same church. So it's absolutely fine to have your own personal religion. And it doesn't have to have a name or a stereotype. You don't have to call yourself a Baptist or a Methodist or an agnostic or an atheist. You can just be yourself and [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6795s) your own private matter and you can share it with other people or not exactly as you want to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6800s)

And that's the freedom we all left for. This is exactly what we all left for, is to have that freedom of choice, the freedom of, you know, being curious, curious in a world that has a lot of different variations in it and you get to come out here and reap the blessings of it. So it's, you know, navigating what's yours and what was given to you to be yours and differentiating between those two and [realizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6830s) that you can have a very full life out here that fills you beyond anything that you, beyond your wild imagination, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6839s)

Yeah, I mean the world really is your oyster. It's like you've been raised in a small dark cage with no windows and you finally break through the wall and for the first time in your life you see the sunshine and the trees and the birds and the meadows and you think, wow, it's an amazing world. And then as you travel on through life, you realize, well, I'm still living on an island and there's actually a whole continent beyond the ocean and you find there's more continents and then you find there's the whole universe with stars. So the [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6869s) or the universe is so vast and full and varied and there's no limits on you once you've escaped the brethren. You can go where you like. You can explore whatever aspect of the universe you find fascinating and good and amazing and that's something, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6886s)

Do something that brings joy every single day, whatever that is.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6891s)

Yeah, and that's true for your spirituality as well. That journey that Richard just described of the expanse and exploration and opening your mind, that is true of your spirituality too because the brethren's spirituality is so highly controlled and so institutionalized, and it's not the only way to experience God or spirituality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6914s)

Exactly. Well said. Thank you so much, Lindy, for joining us today. We really, really appreciate every single time you come on here and share your expertise and wisdom. I know that you guys appreciate it. They have asked for you back on again. So I was so grateful that you were able to come on and bring Sam on and introduce us.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6933s)

Yeah, good with Sam, eh? That was really incredible.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6938s)

And we want to do a shout out. She's got, they've got an event coming up. Can you give the listeners and viewers some more information on that?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6944s)

Yeah, so Sam's actually one of a group of therapists, I believe they all are, in Australia who recently started something called the Religious Trauma Collective. And I'm really excited about that. It only launched towards the end of last year. But it's an amazing registry of therapists and coaches and practitioners who all have got an interest in this area of spiritual abuse or religious trauma. And they can work internationally, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6975s) they do have a particular base in Australia and New Zealand. And they're doing an online conference in a few, a couple of months, I think. So yeah, watch this space. We'll share a bit more about it, but go check their website out because they will also have resources and they do list therapists who are specifically trained in these areas [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=6998s)

So there'll be a link below for that. And also you'll see it on the screen here, a link to their website. So yeah, go check them out and go and check out Jilly Jenkinson's book. Again, an incredible book. Janja Lalich also has an incredible book out there too. So there are workbooks out there that can help you maneuver and walk through some of the transitions that we all go through post-leaving. I also want to remind you guys all that we, myself, Richard and Ben are all going to be at the ICSA conference in [July](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7028s) in Montreal, Canada and we have a GoFundMe going on just to help cover the cost of our travel expenses and that is up on the screen as you can see right now and there'll be a link down below if anybody can, if you can share it, donate as little as five dollars, just every little bit helps, counts, gets us to there. And it's a super, super important conference to be at. It really is going to expand some things here in North America for us that we've been working on. Yeah, so stay tuned and we're looking really looking [forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7058s) to going there. Thank you Richard, thank you Lindy and thank you Sam again for your time and effort coming on here and explaining everything that you'd explained. Thank you guys so much. Until next time, much love to you all.

Richard and I had a short conversation with Dennis Wragge on his search for a church after he left.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7080s)

Hello, Dennis. I invited you on today because we're doing a podcast which is speaking about the spiritual trauma and the experiences spiritually of people when they leave the brethren. And you had a very interesting story you told me a few years ago after you left the church. I just think it might be really helpful for our listeners if you could just go over that experience for us again.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7107s)

Sure, Richard. I think the story you're referring to is, I'll give you a little of my background. When I left the Brethren, the choice was where do we want to go spiritually? And for a couple of years, I tried what the Brethren would call the world. And I had a lot of fun, but there was an emptiness spiritually. And yet to go [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7137s) an organized church was so ingrained into me that I just could not do it. It was, it was just horrendous. And I happened to be out of town and I met a lady who had formerly been a brethren and she was going to a Baptist church. And she persuaded me to go to the Baptist church with her, which was a traumatic experience. If [anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7167s) is in there, they'll realize the trauma I went through. I thought when I walked through the door, the light fixture was going to fall on my head, and it was all God's judgment. It scared the dickens out of me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7183s)

Just to clarify for people who are not familiar with brethren teaching, they not only believe that they're the only true church, but they also believe that every other church is sort of conducting some kind of terrible blasphemy merely by existing, and that if you leave the brethren and go to any other denomination, that is a very serious sin. Is that essentially what it is, Dennis?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7211s)

Yes, that's exactly it. And I thought, I literally thought, and I was probably in my mid-40s at the time, so I was not a an uneducated kid. I had grown up in the Brethren, and that's all I'd ever known, and that's what I've been taught, that to go to another place was very inferior and substandard in all the terms that are used. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7242s) went to the Baptist church, and I survived. Nothing fell out of the roof and hit my head. And my son who was with me filled out a, in churches they have a little welcome card in the back of the seat in front of you, and Eric went and filled this card out. And lo and behold, later in that week, I got a visit from this young pastor [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7272s) came to visit me, which was a little bit unnerving, but we got talking. The first thing I did, like a good brethren host, I offered him a beer and I didn't know that Baptists traditionally are not beer drinkers. But anyway, he very politely, he didn't put me down, he just said no thank you and told me that he used to be an alcoholic and [God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7303s) had come in and saved him from that disease.

Anyway, that's by the by. And so I sat down with him. We're on the top floor of a condo building. And I crossed my arms like this. And I said, OK, tell me why you think the Baptists are the best, is the best church.

And I'd like to pass on to anybody that's struggling right now what he told me that set me free. It helped set me free. It's a long process, but he said, "Dennis, look out, we're out in the prairies, look at them on the beauty of creation. What do you see?" And I said, "What are you talking about?" And he said, "Would it be fair to say it's variety?" [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7363s) who created everything? And of course I said, well God did. And he said, well, does that maybe teach you that God loves variety?

And then he went on to say, I don't think the Baptists are the best. I think the Baptists are something that God has provided for you. And if you come to our [church,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7393s) we would love to welcome you. But maybe you've got more talent that can worship and serve God better. If you are musically inclined, you can go to the Salvation Army, and you can blow a horn in the Salvation Army and glorify God that way. If you are more inclined to be traditional, you can go to the Anglican Church or we welcome you in the [Baptist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7424s) Church. He didn't immediately zero in on “and you drink for goodness sakes, you're not allowed.”

None of that kind of stuff. It was just the variety that God likes and his explanation was God loves variety and in God's love and mercy, he's provided a place for everybody. And he encouraged me to find out what gifts I had and find a church where I could use those gifts to [glorify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7462s) and advance God's kingdom. It was a very simple thing, and it's not that the division of Christianity is something bad. It's something that God has provided for the blessing of every person, and your gifts, Richard, are way different than mine. And Cheryl, her gifts are different than mine, but we can all be in unity together and find a place where [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7493s) can serve God in a way that is good.

And I can say, in my case, I found that. I now go to quite a large church, which is my preference. I serve there. I do as much help for the community as I can. I try and use any little gifts I have. The brethren will [say,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7523s) well, I'm worldly. I go to the theater or in other places, they call it off Broadway or I don't know, here we just call it going to a show. And once in a while we go to shows, we do worldly things.

Or I drive a fancy Jaguar sports car. That's worldly. Well, okay, nobody condemns me for being worldly. I've been set free from all the bondages. I'm not judged on whether I have money or I don't have money.

I've experienced both while I've been out of the brethren, but I'm not judged on that. Some people may think, well, I am. I'm poorer than an awful lot of people who go to my church, are way better off, and I'm better off than they are other people. But it doesn't matter.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7583s)

So you would say really the great thing about escaping from the cult is you can actually be yourself and you're not having to constantly conform to other people's religions, other people's ideas, other people's expectations.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7601s)

Absolutely Richard, it's what's called freedom.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7606s)

Dennis, that's absolutely brilliant, thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fksLjtOMUgQ&t=7609s)

So much Dennis for coming on and sharing that little piece of your story with everyone. I'm sure it will help benefit many that are trying to get out right now and recent leavers that have gotten out.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
