## Summary

** The one priest is Greg Baldwin not Greg Marham as printed at 3:35**
TRIGGER WARNING!
Listen in as 4 Plymouth Brethren “priests” subject a lone teenager to a vicious and humiliating hour-long Gestapo-style interrogation.  Never before in the 200 year history of the PBCC has the brutality of the Brethren priests been recorded and made public. For former members, this will be a highly triggering yet deeply familiar experience – for the public, this will come as a visceral shock – as the raw cruelty and arrogance of Bruce Hales’ inner circle of “enforcers” is loudly and clearly exposed. The PBCC ‘s expensive PR spin doctors have made great claims of “compassion in action” and  that “family is at the heart of who we are”. Listen to this merciless assault on both the teenager and his family and judge for yourself how much compassion is shown to a young person who crosses the path of the PBCC elites.
Lead interrogators, Mick Strange and Rod Diplock, multi-millionaire directors of Allfasteners USA and Controltek USA respectively, are also 2 of the 3 directors of “Plymouth Brethren Christian Church” incorporated in Ohio, USA – placing them at the very top of the Church hierarchy. Strange is a co-director with Gregory Hales in the fixings business, while Diplock has a joint venture in the international property market with Dean Hales – Shavano Consulting. As always in the cult, connections with the Hales family, and huge amounts of money equate to absolute power, and the ability to instill deep rooted fear and unquestioning obedience on the long-suffering Brethren congregations.
As the interrogation proceeds, the priests in their anger let slip a closely guarded secret – the name of the man who owns UBT – the vaunted billion dollar “financial wing” of the cult.
The story has a bittersweet conclusion – the victim leaves the cult and builds a new and very successful life for himself – but is now estranged from his family who remain under Bruce Hales’ regime of brainwashing and blind obedience.
Following the recording of the “priestly” former PBCC members, Cheryl and Richard, review the 4 ingredients that make up a “Bruce Hales” priestly interrogation, and  welcome guest, Shanelle, who gives a therapist's view on the catalogue of religious, emotional and psychological abuse and harm that Brethren victims are subjected to by their leaders.
**EDIT- At 3:31 it says Greg Marham and it should say Greg Baldwin**

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7s)

Trigger warning. This is an audio of a priestly visit. It is very triggering. Discussion on suicide and sexual abuse. Viewer discretion is advised.

Hi everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I am Cheryl Hope, an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren, or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), and today I am joined with Richard Marsh who is also an ex-member. Welcome Richard. Hello. Today we are bringing you a very disturbing audio of a priestly visit. So for those of you that suffer still from their priestly visits or get triggered easily, this comes with a trigger warning.

I had to listen to this a few times to remove the teenager's name [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=48s) it and it triggered me in so many ways. I had priestly visits like this every week as well as watched my parents being talked to like this. This audio features Mick Strange and Rod Diplock, as well as Greg Baldwin and Randy Thomas. At the beginning of this, you will hear the teenager announce to everyone he's recording this, so they are all aware that this was recorded.

When you listen to this, I want us all to remember our family still in there getting this treatment if you choose to walk out of line or question things. But I also want you to have compassion for yourself for all those priestly visits we've all had to endure. We are going to bring a therapist on the end of this to hear her thoughts on this kind of religious trauma and what kind of therapy is out there to help those that still suffer from being inside the PBCC.

At the [beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=102s) of this audio, it is kind of rough, he's got a phone obviously somewhere, but he's just setting up for the priest to arrive. So just get through the first few minutes. It's super important to listen to how the parents are setting him up for this priestly visit. They're very nervous and I think we all kind of relate to how our, especially us as teenagers, can relate to our parents setting us up for that priestly visit and really wanting us to come bring everything out into the open and become right. So here's the audio.

[The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=133s) person getting this priestly visit is waiting for a phone call from Mick Strange and Rod Diplock. His local priests come to his house to oversee the priestly visit from there. The local priests that are coming are Greg Baldwin and Randy Thomas.

(Recording starts)

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=148s)

Well, I'm going to record everything for my own safety, okay. I can't have false witnesses.

Just make sure everybody knows I started a recording now. Okay. This is for my own protection. They're talking about law and court and everything else…

**Mom**

Do you know what it is?

**Trent**

I know what it;s related to.

**Dad**

Don’t try and be smart now, OK.

The last thing you want to do is be fighting the brethren and fighting Mr Hales because you know what? You will never win.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=183s) 

That’s not I’m thinking. It's fine…

**Dad**

That's exactly what the problem is, your thinking.

**Trent**

Its fine, OK.

**Dad**

 Its not fine\! Look, that’s exactly what the  problem is, It’s satanic\! It’s satanic. Don’t tell me it’s fine. It's satanic\!

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=201s)

I'm really confused. 

**Dad**

Well, just tell them. 

**Mom**

Well, tell them. Just bring anything you know that's wrong out and get it clear. 

**Dad**

They’re here. Come on in.

Do you want a drink of water?

**Greg Baldwin**

 I wouldn't mind a little water.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=230s)

 It might help. Greg? How's it going?

### **Dad**

Does Jordan need to be here too? 

**Trent**

You alright?

**Jordan**

(Whispers) I’m worried about you\!

[**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=255s)

Okay. I gotta disclose that I'm recording this. For my legal safety. I have to.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=255s)

You don't have to…playing games…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=255s)

But I have to protect myself.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=255s)

It’s not about protecting. We are brothers.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=255s)

I can't screw myself. 

**Dad**

Like I told you, this is an opportunity just to come clean.

**Dad**

 I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. 

**Trent**

I know what's happening. 

**Dad**

I know we've had some discussions. 

**Trent**

What I can't figure out is how it's happening. I'm just so confused.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=291s)

We don't want you to be confused. I think Rod and Mick wanted to kind of…

**Dad**

 Just get on, yeah.

 **Greg Baldwin**

Just to kind of…

**Dad**

 I mean if you want to just sit here, do you want to just sit here, here or wherever, wherever you're here or here, it's fine. Come sit down here.

**Greg Baldwin**

 I'll sit here.

**Dad**

 Why don't you sit there, yeah, where or anywhere.

**Greg Baldwin**

 I'll sit anywhere. I guess Randy will probably want to... yeah, I'm fine.

**Dad**

 You sit there, right, and then okay. Sorry. I'm sorry take you guys out of your way, too. I feel bad. 

**Randy Thomas**

Yes.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=333s)

Hello? 

**Mick Strange**

Hello. 

**Trent**

Yeah, good. Just so we're all on the same page, I wanted to disclose to everybody that I will be recording this conversation just for my own safety.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=333s)

That's fine. No problem.

We have a report that you have hacked the UBT server and or email accounts etc. of UBT. Is that correct?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=364s)

No.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=368s)

So what you are saying in writing is not correct?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=371s)

That's correct.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=374s)

So what you've said to other persons is not correct?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=377s)

Yes.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=378s)

So we're giving you an option, okay? 

**Trent**

Okay.

**Mick Strange**

 I want you listen very carefully. Okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=390s)

Yeah, I'm listening. 

### **Mick Strange**  You are listening?

**Trent**

Yes.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=396s)

We're the owners of UBT. We're the owners of, you might say, the intellectual property…

**Trent**

Correct

**Mick Strange**

 …the constituents, and the brand, and we will protect it to its fullest extent. If you're not prepared to come into the clear, write everything down, tell us everything that you've done, we will have no option but to put this into the hands of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=426s) law, and if that means that you've got to answer it from jail, we're prepared to go that far.

**Trent**

 Okay.

**Mick Strange**

Now, I'm making myself very, very clear, okay? We're giving you an amnesty time. We're giving you time to get yourself into the clear about what you've done. And if you're not prepared to do it, we will have no option.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=450s)

Okay.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=396s)

Does that make it clear, Rod? 

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=451s)

Yeah. Yeah, it makes it very clear.

### **Dad**

Yep. Well, could I ask what's been done? Because I don't know a thing about this part of it.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=463s)

Mick,did you hear what just said?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=463s)

I don't know anything about this.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=467s)

He's hacked multiple email addresses. He's hacked the email servers. We've got it in writing. We've got it in his writing. And if he feels it's better to pit his will and his wits against what he's put in writing and the law, that's fine. That's the way we're prepared to go. That's how far we're prepared to go. We're not prepared to muck around.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=494s)

Well, how do you say that you didn't hack it then, if you have it in writing you did?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=498s)

It was used as a manipulation technique, as sad as that sounds, to draw out a reaction in another person. There's nothing incriminating in what I wrote.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=518s)

But you didn't in fact hack it?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=518s)

No. And if you want to spend the time and the resources to...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=522s)

Just stop right there. Just stop right there. Just stop right there. We will spend the time, the resource, and the money to protect our brand, our constituents, and every single resource we've got we'll put at it, okay? Let me tell you that very clearly. We will not stop. We will not. We’ll take every single precaution because you put it in writing. You've told certain persons what you've told them and we will protect our brand. We'll protect everything we've got.

And if you think you're going to play fast and loose [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=560s) us, hey, you have it how you will it. You want to try and play fast and loose with us, have at it. That's all I'm saying. You want to fight us?

### **Dad**

I mean, what's the limit?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=572s)

If you want to think you can do whatever you like, have at it.

**Trent**

Mick\!

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=576s)

I mean, I don't understand. I haven't heard a thing about this. I've heard other things.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=579s)

Can you please be quiet for a second? Mick, I love you. Okay? I'm not here to play games. I'm not here to lie to you. I know the resources you have. I'm not stupid. I also know the digital trail that anything leaves if you were to do any of that stuff. I'm not naive in that sense. So I wouldn't sit here on the phone in front of, I don't know how many people are listening, and tell you I didn't do something when in fact I did. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=615s) can assure you I did not do any of the mentioned activities.

You're correct in the sense that I did write them down and I did tell somebody that. But like I said before, it was used to elicit a reaction, probably wrongly. 

**Dad**

Yeah, but do you see the wickedness of that?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=642s)

I'm asking you again, are you listening very carefully?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=646s)

I'm listening very carefully.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=648s)

Do you want to get completely into the clear and bring out everything you've done and put it on paper, everything you've hacked, or would you rather us in the morning contact the police and have them sort this out with you?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=662s)

I'll be happy to, excuse me, I'll be happy to outline everything in relation to what I said, and I know it sounds...

### **Dad**

Are you prepared to put it right?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=662s)

Yeah, I'll write down any...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=683s)

Stop. Don’t waffle with me mate. Listen to me carefully. Are you prepared to put everything there? I'm giving you an amnesty. Rod and I will give you an amnesty…

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=693s)

Take advantage of it.

**Mick Strange**

…if you're prepared... 

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=694s)

Mick, you're breaking up. Mick, you're breaking up. Mick, you there?

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=713s)

I think we lost him, Rod.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=715s)

Okay, so…

**Trent**

 Just, can you calm down, please? This is not your conversation to join.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=723s)

Well, I'm your father, and I didn't know anything about that part of it.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=727s)

This is bigger than you.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=729s)

I realize. I'm just appealing you to just come clear and put it all right. I mean, if you told somebody a lie and faked it or whatever it is, then put that right. I don't know what you wrote.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=743s)

Yeah, it's complicated.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=745s)

If you didn't do it, then OK, I believe you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=745s)

It was used to garner a reaction.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=752s)

Well, then all that needs to be cleared. We don't have time for this stuff. Do you get it?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=768s)

Yeah, I'm not... I'm not naive. I'm not going to try and fight against the team of millionaires …It's not…

### **Dad**

We don't have time for this. We don't have time for even faking stuff and spending time emailing people about whatever it is.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=787s)

It's so fruitless. It's a witch hunt.

### [**Trent's Father**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=788s)

Well, then tell me what it is.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=789s)

Yeah, sorry. I went to a bad zone and let me admit back on. Hold on.

**Dad**

Just tell me as a father what it is. I'm just trying to help you because...

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=795s)

No, I appreciate it.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=801s)

Are you there, Mick? Yeah. Yeah. Randy, are you there?

**Randy Thomas**

 Yes, I am. 

**Rod Diplock**

Yeah, good. Sorry about that. We went into a bad zone. 

**Mick Strange**

So what was the last thing you heard me say?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=813s)

You asked if I was prepared to write down any activities in the relation of what you just said, or have you hand it over to the law enforcement in pursuit of that way?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=829s)

So what I'm saying is hacking email, passwords, anything. And I'm not looking for something, or Rod and I are not looking for something where you just come out with some weaselly, weaselly excuse and say, you know, I found a couple of email addresses. We want to know how you hacked the server, the means in the way you got in, what email addresses you've seen, what password you've seen, what information you've seen. And if we're not satisfied that we haven't got every single bit of evidence, we have a mandate from the board that we will put this into the hands of the law.

**Trent**

OK, Yeah um…

**Mick Strange**

 And I can tell you now, you go to jail first and I'll ask questions later. Okay? You think I'm being funny? Play fast and loose with us and you'll find out what it really is.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=892s)

Mick, I'm not here to play games. Like I said...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=897s)

Right. Well, get yourself right, you stupid idiot\! Get yourself right\!

**Trent**

Mick\!

**Mick Strange**

You think you…You wanna go to hell? You wanna go to hell? Do you know what hell is? Has your father ever taught you?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=909s)

Yes. Yes, he has.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=911s)

Well, don't muck around. Don't be smart to me. Don't be smart to the rest of us on the phone. Get yourself right, and you better get yourself right fast.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=921s)

I fully agree with that. 

**Trent**

I just want to reiterate one thing, is that I'm not naive. I know if I actually did do any of these things...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=932s)

You, you, you, you, you…Listen to me. You're a stupid, naive idiot, okay? 

**Trent**

Okay.

**Mick Strange**

You're a stupid, dumb, naive idiot. You think you're smarter than us? You think you're smarter than Mr. Hales? You think you're smarter than the system we've set on? You're not, okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=935s)

I'm not. I never said that.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=935s)

You're dumb. You’re dumb.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=935s)

I'm dumb.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=935s)

You’re dumb. You're dumb. You're dumb, okay? And if you don't wake up to yourself, you'll end up with people like Pilate in the lake of fire.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=957s)

Oh, goodness. 

**Mick Strange**

Do you want to go there? Do you want to go there? 

**Trent**

Mick, how do I... 

**Dad**

Just be straight…

**Trent** 

How do I sufficiently explain to you?

### [**Dadr**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

You're being too sly, okay? Be straight up and down and say, I absolutely did not hack it or I did do something.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

I said that.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

Are you very clear about it?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

I'm very clear about it. 

**Dad**

You never touched...

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

This is Rod. This is Rod.

**Dad**

 I'm sorry. I'm upset. 

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

Can you say, you're telling us you have nothing to do and that everything you put today was a complete, utter lie?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=988s)

Is that Johnny? 

**Dad**

No, it's Rod.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=970s)

This is Rod. 

**Trent**

Rod, I can tell you with the utmost assurance that everything written there was absolutely and unequivocally false.

### **Mick Strange**

Well, how do we believe it? 

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1002s)

Yeah, how do we believe it?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1005s)

That, I cannot answer that question.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1010s)

The reason you can't answer, you're not clear about Mr. Hales, you're not clear about the truth, and you need to be. If you were clear, if you were clear, you'd give us a straight answer and we'd be able to have a comfort right now. We have no vendetta with anybody except protecting the brand. Whether it's you, Joe Blow, or somebody in Seattle, it doesn't matter. We're here to protect the Lord's interest and Mr. Hales' interest. The bottom line is you're waffling, and I can tell over the phone. We're following up on a report, and we want clarity.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1045s)

You're not clear about Mr. Hales' son. If you're doing this, be clear and just get it out OK.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1049s)

I'm not trying to beat around and be an ass and try to be a smart aleck. 

**Dad**

Well be straight up and down about it OK.

**Trent**

 OK. I value my position in fellowship. 

**Dad**

I had to go through it.

**Trent**

But can we separate two things? Yes, I am confused about a lot of the fundamentals of the truth. But as you saw in those messages, I'm looking for help. And I'm scared to ask for help because I think I'll lose my place in fellowship.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1074s)

If you're asking for help, you should...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1076s)

Let me tell you, okay? We got on this call to ascertain one thing. If you've breached and hacked the UBT server and the things you say you've done, we're going to follow it through. We're giving you an amnesty to get into the clear, if you're not prepared to do it, we're going to follow it through to the fullest extent of the law. And now you're waffling on about something saying, you know, it's because I'm not clear, I don't see whatever about the truth.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1106s)

Mick\!

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1076s)

That's a different issue. It’s a different issue OK.

**Trent**

I agree it is a different issue. I'm not trying to be a smart ass with you guys. I'm not. I don't know how to explain this well enough. What do you want from me to prove to you that none of that happened? What can I tell you? What can I show you? I'll do anything.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1129s)

We want a statement. We want a statement signed by you to say that you have never tampered UBT, tampered or hacked any UBT equipment.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1141s)

I will sign any, absolutely any agreement in that regard.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1146s)

No. No. No. No. You write out the statement.

**Dad**

You write it.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1150s)

I'll write out the statement.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1151s)

And sign your name to it. And that's what we want out of you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1154s)

I'll write out the statement.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1157s)

And do you think, Mick, to say that everything that he's written in any communications…

**Dad**

It needs to be withdrawn.

### **Greg Baldwin**

it needs that he should withdraw and it's absolutely false?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1169s)

Absolutely. Absolutely, he's just a straight up liar. 

He's trying to... I'll say to you, dude, you're trying to incriminate our brand. You're trying to incriminate the brethren, saying we're doing all sorts of stuff. And you're saying you've got overwhelming evidence against the brethren.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1188s)

That's not what I said, Mick. Mick, I didn't say that.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1193s)

Ha ha\! I've got it in writing. You want me to read it now?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1195s)

He has it in writing, he's got it in writing.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1195s)

He's twisting it.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1195s)

Ha ha ha\! Look, don’t try to pull the wool over my eyes\!

[**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1205s) 

The best thing to do is to listen.

And you're 19 years old, right? And fair enough if you're going, you don't understand things. But what we said, we're separating this, is that what you've done is so serious. And it's so, and there's no justification. And you can't, to make a justification as to why you did it or whatever, really, really that's where we're confused. That's where we stop and say, are we really getting the straight facts?

Because that's a pretty, pretty, I mean, it's a strong statement you made and [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1235s) to put together just to try and confuse somebody or use it to manipulate somebody. It's actually, it's blooming bizarre, to be honest with you. 

**Mick Strange**

Oh, it's criminal. 

**Rod Diplock**

Yeah, absolutely.

**Dad**

I would agree with you. Okay. I have to agree with you. It's not right. It's absolutely not right. We're not in fellowship to be liars…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1247s)

Yeah, I'll agree with everyone. I'll agree with everyone on that point. Okay? But where I'm going to disagree with everyone is the absolute certainty that I did this when it's absolutely certain I didn't do it.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1280s)

Well, it's because of what you wrote.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1282s)

Yeah, I get it.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1283s)

You know, it's your yay, is yay and your nay is nay.

**Dad**

Yeah, that's right. If he's made a statement like that, people are going to think you did it.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1291s)

I think the thing you need to worry about is the sneering, insidious way you put this across like a game. You'd hack UBT and you might say, if you know, you know full well that this is Mr. Hales's business, and you might say that the way you've put it across, you've taken people's information, what do you expect us to do [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1321s) than to completely, totally and utterly protect that?

You talk about things that you believe that is so wrong with the brethren, but we're trying to protect the privacy and you might say the integrity of our constituents. And if you think that being smart about that and lying about it and playing a game with it is something that you can just walk away from now and say, happy days, you know, I was just trying to get at something else. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1357s) need to wake up. You actually are on the path to hell. I just can't say it straightly to you enough. I just, I can't seem to get it into you. You were deluded by the devil to the point where you think this is funny enough just to record or something that we as genuine honest brothers are trying to wake you up to see that you're caught in the clutches of the devil. And you just think it's a game.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1389s)

It's not a game. It’s very serious.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1390s)

You cannot see how serious this is\!

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1395s)

I don't know where to begin with answering that, but I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to, Mick, I'm not trying to play games with you right now on the phone or any of that. Was I trying to play games in the messages?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1395s)

Don't think you're so smart, son. Come on. You're just being sly. Just be straight up and down.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1415s)

I'm trying to be straight up and down.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1415s)

He's got it right in the email…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1423s)

I'll put…Have we all agreed that there's two separate problems? Is that, one, I need a desperate amount of help in sorting out doubts. Correct?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1433s)

I'm here to help you. I've tried to help you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1434s)

That's a separate issue. You assured me over and over I could talk to any of the brothers and that I wouldn't get thrown out of fellowship for doubts. 

**Dad**

That's right.

**Trent**

 I don't know if that's true. I'm scared of it, but that's a separate issue.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1453s)

Let’s get back to the issue, you've made a statement, okay? We have our doubts about you. We have serious, serious doubts about you, okay? And you say you've got your doubts about the brethren? Well whatever. 

**Trent**

Mick, I didn’t say…

**Mick Strange**

Unfortunately your father hasn't been able to make you see that the brethren is only place on the earth…There’s many, many…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1475s)

Mick, don't throw my dad under the bus for this. I won't accept that.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1482s)

Just stop. Just stop. There's many, many reasons we could bring up. What we called you about tonight was something that you claimed in writing. We're putting it to you, if you're prepared to write a statement of everything you've done, because I'm not convinced. You've put passwords out there on this thing that you know somebody's password. I'm not convinced. If you're prepared to put it down in writing, we'll [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1512s) off the call now. We're giving you a certain amount of hours to do it. If we're satisfied with your statement, we won't take it to the police. We'll hold it off for now. And then as far as your doubts about the assembly, you can work through that with the brothers and your father can help you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1532s)

I'm fully prepared to write a statement to assure you that none of that was true.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1540s)

Well where did you get that password from?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1542s)

Which one? There was a couple thrown out there that were...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1542s)

Yeah, where did you get them from?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1542s)

I think creativity is the only thing I could say.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1555s)

What about if it was the actual password?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1558s)

It depends for whose account. 

**Dad**

What do you mean?

**Trent**

There are…OK…

**Dad**

Just tell us\!

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1562s)

Just come into the clear\! Tell us what you put out there… stop deceiving us.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1565s)

Just before God .Just before God.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1570s)

Okay, I know how this is. It was a real password, if that's what you were worrying about. Yes, it was 100% his real password. 

**Rod Diplock**

So it was Dave’s

**Mick Strange**

 How did you get it? 

**Trent**

This is going to sound like the worst and hedgy answer, but it's very complicated to explain. I'll be happy to explain and show you. I could grab a computer and I could show you. But that's a separate topic. The second password I threw out was false. And I don't think there was any more than that, if I'm correct.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1608s)

You, you telling us, you trying to tell me, you say you can grab a computer and tell us how you got this password, or I'd say you may have hacked something.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1618s)

No, it's not. I didn't hack anything. We shared a computer. Okay, it was very well known between us. We shared a virtual computer in the cloud that had what's similar to parental monitoring. Okay, so you could essentially see the keystrokes of whoever used the computer. It's not illegal. We used the same computer. We shared it. He might not have known, but I didn't hack any accounts. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1657s) didn't, there was no hacking. There's a distinction between observing and hacking.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1662s)

Did you go into his accounts?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1664s)

No. And you can see as clear as day in all of them. If you have all the messages, you can read and see that. Do I know his real password or what it was a year ago? Yeah, I believe I do. If that's the one he entered when he got on the computer, yes. But there's nothing... Well, first I want to draw a distinction. It has absolutely nothing to do with UBT. I took…

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1693s)

So, so, so I guess... yeah, I'm not enough of a techie to be able to understand exactly where you're coming from. I just... I just... I'm finding it hard that you're not just capitulating and just saying, you know what, I did this and here's how I did it and I'm, you know, help me out here, let's get out of this mess. But there's all kinds of excuses coming up and little ways to wangle around here and there. I just want a straight, simple answer. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1724s) if you've done anything dodgy or done something a little bit that you shouldn't have done, it should just come out, it should flow clearly out of you if you want to be right. That’s the bottom line.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1731s)

Okay, if you ask a simple question, I'll give you a simple answer. Ask away, I'll do my absolute best not to waffle around and screw around.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1744s)

This is what we asked you.

**Randy Thomas**

They already asked the question.

**Trent**

What was the question?

**Dad**

He already asked you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1755s)

I don't know how to say it any better. The answer is no. A resounding no. First off, nowadays it's impossible to hack email passwords. That's beside the point. The answer is a resounding no.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1774s)

If you told the police department that you used creativity to find somebody's password, they wouldn't buy it.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1780s)

They would if we were using a shared computer and that person was aware.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1787s)

I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. They'll investigate and put the question to you later. I don't think you understand the criminal system.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1800s)

It’s not a… I don't understand the criminal system. I don't have a team of lawyers behind me, but I know what I did. Okay, we can call it devious and not right, but it certainly, unequivocally, was not illegal, and it definitely does not count as hacking in any sense of the word. That I can assure you with all my might. I did not hack anybody's passwords. I didn't hack any computers. I didn't hack any servers. I didn't gain illicit access to any accounts, anything that I wasn't supposed to.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1841s)

You haven't convinced me, okay? You haven't convinced me. 

**Trent**

OK

**Mick Strange**

Because you push back. I would say that we've been appealing on the basis of some comments you've made in writing. I would just say to you, if you don't want to end up in the clink, you better hit the dirt, boy. You're 19\. You're not smart. You think you are. And if you think that you're going to get around us by playing some smart, devious games, sorry buddy.

We're not going to walk away from this and just let... what we're going to protect 100% or 1000%. If you think we're just going to walk away from that and buy some lame eh, excuse from you, I'm sorry, you picked the wrong blokes, okay? Have I made myself clear?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1895s)

I know you made yourself very clear, but there was three distinct references. If I understand correctly, the one you're concerned most about is the UBT because obviously that has the widest spread facts.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1914s)

You talk about the way it was set up, hundreds of email addresses...passwords…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1923s)

That's so... Mick, Mick, it's public knowledge. Everyone knows that. 

**Mick Strange**

What do you mean everyone knows that email addresses and passwords? 

**Trent**

Everyone knows how the UBT BlackBerry servers were set up to monitor the Brethren's communications. You sign off on it in the bottom of the contract. Everyone knows.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1942s)

I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about what you say about knowing how to view their conversations and hack their accounts…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1949s)

I never once said I could view their conversations. I said it was vulnerable. But if you read on, you will see in a message. I said I have never once touched the UBT servers. I wouldn't know where to begin. I honestly would have no foggy idea.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1970s)

Uh uh, listen. Lets…We're going nowhere, okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1971s)

But Mick, Mick, Mick. It's in the messages. 

**Dad**

On the other hand, I mean, to be fair...

**Mick Strange**

If you are not prepared to listen…

**Trent**

I'm not trying to be argumentative with you, but it's in the messages. 

**Dad**

To be fair, Trent stated that he didn't do it. 

**Trent**

I said you can't take part of my word. You can't be a politician and take part in my word and twist it. You've got to read the whole thing.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1992s)

I'm trying to be fair.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1992s)

I said, you know, I'll pull them up right now. 

**Dad**

If he didn't do it…

**Trent**

 I will pull them up right now what I said. 

**Dad**

…To withdraw the lie.

**Trent**

 I'll withdraw the lies, and we can get right about that. But let me be very clear. I said, and you have it. Don't try and deceive me.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=1992s)

I mean, do your brothers agree that he said he did this?

**Greg Baldwin**

 Well, I think one thing I would say this…. I would say this. 

**Trent**

I said to... Okay. I'm sorry, Greg. Go ahead.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2018s)

I'll say this to you. I'll say to you, as Mick said, this is not a time to play. No. Just listen to me for a minute, okay? Just listen to me.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2032s)

I'm listening, Greg.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2033s)

I've had to go through adjustment myself, okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2036s)

Mm-hmm.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2037s)

So don't try to defend yourself. You're in a defenseless position and you just need to be absolute, just downright dead honest.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2050s)

Okay. I think... Okay. Can I just read you four lines, Mick? Maybe you didn't get these. Okay. I could pull up the time I sent the message. I said, first of all, I haven't “hacked” anything in over a year. And I put that in quotation marks because hacked is a very skewed term. I said, it's crazy unethical, it's a waste of time, and it's dangerous.

And it says, which server? I said, what did you mean? It's not as simple as that. I haven't screwed around with the UBT, but I know it's pretty vulnerable. That's a fact. Everyone knows that. And he said, well, you mentioned getting passwords on UBT server, and there are multiple. That's why I asked. 

I replied, I said no you didn't, you are inferring that. He said, well then how did you get people's passwords? I said, by guessing, it's called a joke. Not a good joke, but it's a joke. I said I haven't touched any of that. Scroll down and you have the rest of the messages.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2117s)

I have one question then. 

**Trent**

Ask it.

**Randy Thomas**

In there. You said, I haven't hacked a server in over a year. 

**Trent**

Exactly

**Randy Thomas**

What are you meaning by over a year? What happened a year ago?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2125s)

If you saw the first time I used, this is going to sound so technical, but I put parentheses around the word hacked because it's so misunderstood by people who don't understand technology.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2139s)

Yeah, but what happened a year ago?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2139s)

Nothing happened. When I referred to a year ago, I was just talking about a shared server we had that I happened to be able to view his password when he logged in. I don't have a clue how to hack anything. Mick, if I wanted access to your emails, I wouldn't have a foggy idea where to begin. I genuinely would have no idea. And you saw it. You saw it in the messages.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2173s)

You are not making sense. You're excusing yourself. You put a whole line of BS on a Skype chat. You’re trying  to confuse us. You’re trying to confuse the person you sent the message to. 

**Dad**

Just put it all right. Just put it all right.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2192s)

Dude you need to hit the dirt.  And hurry up. And hurry up. Otherwise…

**Trent**

 Oh my goodness…

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2192s)

…you're going to go one way, okay? And we're not prepared. We're not prepared to keep fighting with you, giving us a line, feeding us a line of BS, trying to shovel it down our throats when you know full well you've fed a load of BS. And…

**Trent**

Is Duncan involved in this?

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2192s)

 I'm telling you to write the statement.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2215s)

I don't want Duncan involved.

**Dad**

He’s not involved.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2224s)

…brothers…get it back to us. We'll feed it back to the UBT board and if they feel that we're satisfied, we'll be satisfied. Otherwise it will go to the police. I can assure you of that. We have a board mandate, okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2237s)

Mick, I'm happy...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2240s)

Stop. Have I made myself clear?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2242s)

You've made yourself very clear. In all fairness...

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2248s)

Do you want to go to jail?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2249s)

No, I don't want to go to jail, but I also know I can't go to jail. Because I didn't do…

**Mick Strange**

Heh heh heh…

**Dad**

Mick can I say something?

**Trent**

I'm not playing games with you here.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2260s)

Mick, can I say something? Okay? I've heard what's happened here and what's transpired, okay? I wasn't aware of what's happening before. I know Trent well enough in my own household, okay, I don't agree at all with, first of all, I don't agree with wasting time doing this kind of thing. It just upsets me. And the other thing is, I don't agree with falsifying any information to people and telling people that it's whatever, all this kind of stuff. I don't agree with it.

But I do believe that... I do believe that we need to believe what he's saying…

**Mick Strange**

 Yeah but he's not coming across in that spirit.

**Dad**

 No, but I do because …

**Mick Strange**

Do you get it? Do you get it? Do you get it? He's not coming across in that spirit. 

**Dad**

…if a person says something... okay, but if Mr. Taylor said... I get it, but if Mr. Taylor said that you've acknowledged something, you accept it. 

**Mick Strange**

Yeah but he, but he’s arguing\!

**Trent**

Mick.

**Mick Strange**

Listen…

**Dad**

 Okay, he said that he is not... that we have to accept his word.

**Mick Strange**

Listen to me. Just stop for one second…

**Dad**

 I'm just trying to be fair, but he said he did not do it, so accept it.

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2335s)

Are you listening…Are you listening???.... Listen to me. We're following up, right? It’s criminal…

### [**Trent's Father**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2341s)

I agree with that.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2343s)

Mick, Mick. There's nothing remotely criminal about this situation.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2349s)

You need to, first of all... such a... I can understand why…

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2353s)

…calling here to get some line or some BS, what we're saying is, if he's prepared to sign a statement and bring out everything he's done, we're prepared to review it, take it back to the board at the UBT… 

**Trent**

Yes, this is the fifth time he’s said it…

**Mick Strange**

…and get signed off to say we will not pursue it criminally.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2371s)

Yes. Mick, Mick. Can I... 

**Dad**

… totally wrong what you've conveyed Trent and be exactly honest…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2378s)

Can I explain something here? My defensive attitude, okay, I agree it's not right and it's certainly not coming across right, but it's because I don't want to lose my place in fellowship. I'm not scared of anything criminally because I haven't done anything criminally wrong. That's not why I'm scared in that regard. 

**Mick Strange**

We’re not talking about your place in fellowship OK, we’re talking about protecting UBT. In the allegations you have made…you will realize, you will realize…

**Dad**

I don’t think this is fair…he’s already made it clear. You don’t continue an interrogation…

**Trent**

Mick. Mick. Mick, let me talk to Mr. Hales. Mr. Hales will see through this bull.

### [**Trent's Father**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2413s)

…he’s already made it clear. You don't continue an interrogation.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2416s)

Mr. Hales could see straight through this. 

**Dad**

I know where to draw the line, OK? I know where to draw the line.

**Trent**

I guarantee you Mr. Hales could see straight through this.

### [**Trent's Father**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2422s)

You don't continue an interrogation because that is provoking.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2425s)

Let me make something perfectly clear. I have not done anything remotely criminally wrong. I have not dreamt of targeting anything of the UBT’s property. Okay, do I use their products and services? Absolutely not. But I don't target them. 

**Dad**

Okay, just keep it at that.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2447s)

Hey, Mick, just one quick question. One point, Mick. My phone's about to die, and we're in the middle of this conversation. So I'm not, and I don't have a charger with me because I'm still out. So I'm just wondering if we do... we will give you, we'll give you the next few hours to put this statement together.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2465s)

That's fine. I'll write you whatever you want to hear, because it's the truth.

**Mick Strange**

 Naah, No, no, no, no.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2472s)

No. It needs to come. It needs to come from your heart. You need to get on your knees about it. 

**Dad**

You need to come from your heart. Son

**Rod Diplock**

 First of all, why would your mind even go there to think about this like this? It's not even the right way to think. So I think you need to cry out to the Lord and ask for help and write it from your heart**.** 

**Dad**

Ok, thank you Mick…

**Rod Diplock**

And we'll make a decision from there. I'll take it back to the board and we'll make a decision which way we go from there.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2495s)

Well, I appreciate your concerns. 

### [**Mick Strange**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2501s)

We'll expect it by 8 a.m. in the morning.

Listen to me. We'll expect it by 8 a.m. in the morning. If we don't receive it by then, we'll have no option but to go back to the board with our recommendation.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2512s)

Yes. I appreciate what's come up. Thank you. 

**Dad**

Thank you. Thank you, Mick and Rod.

**Trent**

 Take care.

**Randy Thomas**

Thank you.

### [**Rod Diplock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2519s)

All right. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2524s)

It's an absolute witch hunt. I have to speak to Mr. Hales. I'm not going through this [again.](http://again.No)  No.  I'm not going to be bullied by…

### [**Father**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2534s)

Listen to me Okay? I'm your father. I don't care if these brothers hear…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2538s)

I'm not gonna be bullied by multi-millionaires over the phone with legal teams…

**Dad**

It’s not bullying.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2538s)

…to pretend something legally against me if I never remotely touched any of it.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2549s)

It's what you wrote.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2549s)

That's not incriminating somebody. You're gonna... I mean, it's what they did by secretly passing my information is just as incriminating as me writing it. No, it's a fact, Greg. It's a fact. You can't transmit that without my permission. You can't. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Yes, if it's UBT. It's about the UBT. I played in the legal world.I played in the legal world. I know.

**Trent**

 I haven't played in the legal world. 

**Greg Baldwin**

But I have. Can I tell you something? So I'll just tell you. I'll just tell you this. 

**Trent**

It's a witch hunt, Greg. 

**Greg Baldwin**

No, it's not. 

**Trent**

They will waste thousands and thousands of dollars. 

**Greg Baldwin**

No, not if you're just absolute dead honest. No fluff. Okay. But stop defending yourself. 

**Trent**

Okay, I bullshitted a little bit. 

**Dad**

But don't defend yourself. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Okay, but stop. Stop. This isn't a game. 

**Trent**

I don't think it's a game. How am I supposed to express the truth?

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2594s)

Can I say one thing. Can I say one thing? I wanna say one thing…

**Greg Baldwin**

Just hit the deck. 

**Randy Thomas**

I want to say one thing.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2600s)

I'm not going to tell them I did it. 

**Randy Thomas**

No, but I want to tell you one thing.

**Trent**

 Just because I didn't.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2600s)

Just hit the deck.

**Trent**

 What does that mean? 

**Greg Baldwin**

Hit the deck? Just take low ground. Just take low ground.

**Dad**

Okay, let Randy say something. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Take low ground. Just take low ground and say you’re totally wrong.

**Trent**

But I didn’t do it\!

### **Dad**

No, well then why did you write it to Dan?

**Trent**

 Okay. That's a separate explanation.

**Dad** 

Well then why did you? Because if they knew about it…

**Trent**

It's a separate explanation. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2616s)

Can I say one thing? I want to get one thing through right now from myself, and I'll say this from my heart. I am not here, and I would never be here to put you out of fellowship. I want to get you that straight right now.

**Trent**

I believe that.

**Randy Thomas**

 I went through hell as a young kid. As a young kid, my entire family, other than my dad and Ruth Silk, are out of fellowship. I went through absolute, utter hell and did not want to be part of the brethren, and didn't want to [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2646s) anything to do with it.

And through the grace of God, I'm here today. And all I can say, is, we're not here to incriminate something against you. What we're here to say, you've taken something, you've put it in writing. Okay? Picture it. You can see where it's coming from. 

**Trent**

Yeah, I have it. 

**Randy Thomas**

Okay? You've got it. But you can picture where the things come from. What you need to do tonight, and I'm appealing to you. Because I'll tell you what Mr. Hales told me. I got word and it came through Rod to me to put everything down in writing, everything, and I had to go home and write everything down and you know something, I sent it off. They asked for it to come. It was a hard thing. It was [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2691s) sleepless night. 

Put it down in writing. We're here to try to save you. We do not want you to be have doubts. We do not want you to go to hell. We are not wanting this. We are wanting everything in our stretch of our imagination. I can say this for Greg and I'll say it for myself. We're here to show you as locals that we love you. We wouldn't have come over at 11:30 at night if we didn't love you. 

**Trent**

I love you guys.

**Randy Thomas**

I want to get that clear. Because I'm not here…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2721s)

I know that.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2723s)

I could go into more depth on it but literally I went through living hell in my soul and wanted to have nothing to do with the brethren. I wanted to have nothing to do with anything. And I was converted. I had to write everything down on paper and go through it. And all I can say is our brother loves you. He loves me. He loves Greg. He loves your father, your mother.

**Trent**

I believe it. 

**Randy Thomas**

And what we're trying to do is I'm here, Greg's here, because we love you. We're not here to incriminate you. What we're here to say is there's something that you've put down on paper today. You've put something down on paper today [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2764s) down on electronically, whatever, but what we have to do is tonight I appeal to you to take it and write it down. You know why you said what you said, what you did, what you did. Write it down from the depth of your heart. This is not to be a defensive thing. I'm not here to incriminate you. Greg’s not here to incriminate you…

**Trent**

 No. You two are not.

**Randy Thomas**

Honestly, they're here from the point of directors of a brand of something that you said that you had hacked.

### **Greg Baldwin**

Can I just tell you something?

**Dad**

 If that was somebody doing it to my business.

**Greg Baldwin**

That's exactly what I was going to say.

### **Dad**

Like if I heard they did it to my business,

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2797s)

How would you feel that was me?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2805s)

But there's a difference between priestly care and a legal witness. 

**Greg Baldwin**

But I think that's... 

**Trent**

And they crossed the line. Greg, I'm a teenager. They crossed the line. 

**Randy Thomas**

I'm not here to be mean to you. 

**Dad**

Just listen to me…

**Trent**

It confirmed everything I feared. I said, "Watch, they're going to come after me with a legal team thinking I did something." I said, "You read the messages."

**Randy Thomas**

 I didn't read the messages. Never seen the messages.

### [**Greg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2834s) **Baldwin**

That's really serious what you read.

**Dad**

That’s playing into the hands of the devil. That’s really serious.

### **Greg Baldwin**

 I understand. Just listen me out for a minute. Look, I think you know me enough by now. I don't have an agenda. Do you understand? I understand. Okay, but I'm going to tell you something straight from my heart. What you wrote was dangerous. You have to understand that if that was your father's business, and you know what? Your father would take every legal..

**Randy Thomas**

Your father would go after a lawyer…

**Greg Baldwin**

.You know why? Because if your father didn't... Okay, but hold on. Okay, so if UBT knew, or any other organization... Okay, I'm going to talk from strictly a legal and a business perspective. Okay? Right. You're in a very vulnerable position.

**Trent**

Sure. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Because you've made charges that are very, very serious. Okay? 

**Trent**

Yeah.

**Greg Baldwin**

 So, basically, if they do not protect [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2891s) clients, do you know what? UBT would be responsible, fully responsible. Okay? I know. And you have to understand, who sits? Who sits at the top of UBT? 

**Trent**

Mick Strange, apparently. 

**Randy Thomas & Greg Baldwin**

No. Who sits at the top of UBT? Who is the CEO?

**Trent**

Mr Hales.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2908s)

Okay. But just don't try. 

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2915s)

I know where you're coming from…

### **Greg Baldwin**

Don't. Don't. Please don't. But what I'm saying. Sorry…

**Dad**

… how serious it really is to do that. OK.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2920s)

But here's my problem. If, okay, they're directors of the UBT, right? They should be knowledgeable about their business. If they had remotely a clue about their business, they would know that it's unequivocally false. 

**Greg Baldwin**

It doesn’t matter No, but that's not the problem. 

**Randy Thomas** 

Can I ask you a question?

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2936s)

Cyber warfare? Cyber warfare…

**Trent**

 They don't understand. 

**Greg Baldwin**

No. It's the cyber capital of the world. Why? Why do they have massive companies? 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2948s)

Why is Agility in this? Why is Task in this? They're all in it…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2952s)

Why don't they have a cybersecurity team show the messages and totally debunk it in five seconds? 

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2957s)

Sorry, you're following me.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2957s)

Do you mind if I say something?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2959s)

About their business? If I could take five minutes and think up some hogwash about hacking, it scares them into sending a league team and thousands of dollars after... 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2974s)

Can I ask you a question? Can I ask you a question?

**Trent**

...if it was my business? I wouldn't. I would not send anybody after someone who wrote that. Because I'm knowledgeable about it.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=2974s)

Can I ask you one question? Your father runs a business. You're part of your father's business. Your father hears that it comes to him that the kid down the street…

**Greg Baldwin**

Use me.

**Randy Thomas**

Use Greg…

**Greg Baldwin**

 I'm sending stuff out, putting stuff out, you know how smart I am about UBT… 

**Randy Thomas**

Putting stuff out. But he's hacked into stuff and the server…The fact is your father would be after them too. 

**Dad**

I would.

**Randy Thomas**

Your father wouldn't think twice

**Trent**

I wouldn’t let him.

**Randy Thomas**

… but it would be to protect his own brand and the business.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3011s)

It's deeper than that.

**Trent**

 It's deeper than that. I understand, but no, you're good. Yeah, I get it's deep.

### **Dad**

What you've done in the writing is serious…

**Trent**

What I've done…

**Dad**

…and I can understand where they're coming from. Now I do also understand that once you very definitely said, "I didn't do it," I understand that you need to first of all put that in writing and then accept it.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3033s)

If they can be manipulated into sending a legal team after me.

### [**Greg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3039s) **Baldwin**

That's not the point. No, the point is that you are damaging the testimony.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3041s)

It's pathetic. It's absolutely pathetic how little they know about their own business. But that's besides the point. I agree. I'm just saying they should not be.

### **Dad**

You know what's concerning Mom and I more than what you wrote?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3061s)

 I know. It's the doubt. But that's separate. It's a separate problem. Everything that's happened has confirmed every doubt I have.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3067s)

Hey, wait. Have Greg and I, the way we've treated you tonight, have we caused a doubt in your mind? 

**Trent**

No, you haven't. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3067s)

I'm here to tell you, as local brethren, as local brethren, we are here, and I would be here day in, day out, to help you. Because I want to see you through. I care about you.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3088s)

I also want to defend... I will defend, I want to defend Mick and Rod. Just listen me up. We're not here to create any division of any sort. You know, early, I will say this, that I come from a family line of fairly technical minds. If you want to twist something up in knots, we can have at it. OK,but you know what? That's a waste of time. 

**Dad**

It is a waste of time. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Okay. You know what?

**Trent**

I’m not trying to…

**Greg Baldwin**

You know what? Put your hackles down. Just put, no, just collapse. I remember someone telling me,”’Greg, hit the deck\!” And you know what? Sometimes you might not even think, maybe you think you're not the most wrong. You may think that someone else is more wrong than you. You know what?

**Trent**

 I feel the most wrong. 

**Greg Baldwin**

But you know what? At the end of the day, it's between you and the Lord. It's no one else. 

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3156s)

I know. They're making it seem like it's between me and the legal team. 

**Greg Baldwin**

By what authority? By what authority?

**Trent**

How is that the Lord's spirit displayed on the phone call? 

**Greg Baldwin & Randy Thomas**

By what spirit…No, no, no…JSH said…Hold on…by what spirit…JSH said…this is legal…It’s a business you relayed something to…

**Trent**

Don’t try and tell me that the spirit displayed was right on that phone call.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3174s)

There's two separate issues. 

**Trent**

There is two separate issues. 

**Randy Thomas**

Okay, in regards to your doubts, I want to keep that totally separate. 

**Trent**

I want to keep that separate

**Randy Thomas**

And actually, Mick and Rod ask that that be kept separate too. Okay, let's make that very clear. Mick and Rod ask that that be kept separate. Greg and I and your father ask, and that's kept separate. What we're asking is we would like to deal with this one matter here first. This is something, and if you think it through, you can see where they are defending the legal position.

**Trent**

 [Okay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3205s) I can see where they are coming from.

**Dad**

Then just put it right on the side.

**Randy Thomas**

All we're asking, I think that Greg and I should leave it with you, leave it with your father, leave it with your mother, and leave it with the Lord. We're asking you to write something down tonight.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3228s)

I will. 

**Randy Thomas**

Put it down. Put your signature onto it. We will come. I don't mind coming by here and clocking. It doesn't matter. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Can you email it? 

**Trent**

I'll send it wherever.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3231s)

Whatever. You can send it to me by email. Greg and I are not here to broadcast. But all we're asking for is for you to capitulate on this. Don't have a defensive spirit. Because right now, you're, no, just listen to me.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3251s)

I'm trying not to. 

**Randy Thomas**

Right now, you've had a defensive spirit on this. 

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3251s)

I have.

**Randy Thomas**

 And I would like to think, I'm not here.

**Trent**

I’ve been attacked by a legal team.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3251s)

I'm not here…

**Greg Baldwin**

No one’s attacking you , you know what…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3253s)

If that's not an attack…

**Greg Baldwin**

But you know what? No, no, no.

**Trent**

 I'm sorry. That was an aggressive approach. 

**Dad**

No no no. No, I agree with them on taking an….

**Trent**

 It was an attack.

**Greg Baldwin**

It wasn’t an attack.

**Trent**

 It was an attack. It was threats.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3264s)

I fully agree…

**Trent**

It was threats. 

**Dad**

Listen\!  It wasn't…

**Trent**

It was blackmail.

**Greg Baldwin**

No, it's not blackmail.

**Trent**

If I took that to a judge. 

**Greg Baldwin**

No, you wouldn't stand. It’s not blackmail.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3275s)

Greg\! It is. But I'm not trying to defend myself. There's nothing to defend.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3278s)

OK, but all I want to say to you is one thing that JSH said. “By what authority do you speak?”

**Trent**

 I agree. 

**Greg Baldwin**

You just let that sink in.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3288s)

Yeah.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3289s)

And if you can't say that you get your authority from God in what you're saying, the best thing you can do is just cry out.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3300s)

That's right. I asked for you to cry out.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3301s)

How do I explain the truth without sounding defensive if I didn't do it? Tell me how to word it.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3312s)

Just hit the deck. 

**Trent**

That's not helping, Greg. Hit the deck doesn't mean anything to me.

**Dad** 

Can I say something? You might want to listen to me.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3314s)

How do I explain I didn't do it without sounding defensive?

### **Dad**

Do you know why? Okay, because I don't mind just sharing. Because you and I have talked because further underlying it...

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3327s)

They said it's a separate issue.

### **Dad**

I agree, but underlying…

**Trent**

It’s a separate issue.

**Randy Thomas**

… but underlying…

**Trent**

 Yeah, I know, underlying, yes.

**Dad**

…attitude and that's what we're trying..

**Trent**

How do I write the letter? I'm asking. I want help. 

**Dad**

…questions and we started talking about… it. 

**Trent**

Maybe it's just my tone of voice is wrong.

**Dad**

…come let us reason together…

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3347s)

Think about this…

**Dad**

I said we want to get help together…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3353s)

I'm shaking. I can't take this. How do I defend myself?

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3353s)

It's not about defending yourself. I want to tell you one scripture, OK….

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3358s)

I can't have multi-millionaires chasing me with a legal team…

**Greg Baldwin**

They're not. They won't. 

**Trent**

They will. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Not if you put it right. 

**Trent**

Yeah, they'll send it to my board of directors and yeez...

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3367s)

No, not if you put it right.

**Trent**

 It was a threat. 

**Dad**

No, if you put right what you told…

**Trent**

That's totally separate. 

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3367s)

No, it isn't. That's not what's separate. That's what's separate.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3378s)

That's not what's separate.

**Trent**

I'll withdraw every statement I said. Is that not being defensive?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3379s)

That's what they want. 

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3384s)

No. All you're saying is that everything you wrote was a complete and utter lie. 

**Dad**

It’s a falsehood

**Trent**

I can write that. I can write that all night.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3394s)

But what I would like you to do, one thing I'd like you to say, I would like it to be in your words, not in Greg's words, not in my words, not in your father's words.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3404s)

I agree with that.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3404s)

Say one thing, and then we should keep moving and let you work this out with the Lord. Is take the younger son in Luke 15\. He went off into debauchery. He went off and did his own thing. But he came back on his knees, pleading for help. This is not a matter of being defensive. He's asking. He was asking for help. Make me as one of the hired servants. It was, what can I do? All [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3434s) want to do is have my place in fellowship. And the thing is is that's what you want if I get this correctly from what you're saying, that's what you're asking for. Well, what we're here to do is to help you. Please tonight, I don't think we need to keep going on about this. We're not here to attack you.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3453s)

I know, really.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3455s)

But what we are saying is please put something down in writing. Let it out. I'll tell you right now, I put it down in writing. I put everything down in writing that I knew of. And I was sunk in sin. If anyone was sunk in sin, I was sunk in sin. And Mr. Hales, out of the grace of God, I'm here today. 

**Greg Baldwin**

That’s good. I am too.

**Randy Thomas**

Out of the grace of God, I was able to get married and find a wife. What we're here to do is we want to see you happily built up with a household.

Think about it. It's a double-edged here. I want you to think about the one side. We're not here to put you out of fellowship, okay? What we're here to do, what we're here to do is to go over what you've put down here. That's why we came here tonight, to put what you put down in writing. You put something down in writing. This is your own words. Nobody can talk to these words for you. Okay? You've put something in writing. There's nothing that anybody can do but to go to protect their rights by what you've said. Okay? So I'm leaving it with you. I'm leaving it with your father and mother. I'm leaving it with the Lord. Is that fair, Greg?

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3532s)

Yeah. That's all I think we can do. Put that right.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3536s)

Let's deal with this. We will be here to help you through the rest. And I am not... I just want to reiterate that. I know there's been some diss and some tension, whatever. But I want to tell you that it's only because of Mr. Hales that I'm here. And what we're here to do is we're here to save you. I don't want you going to hell. I don't want you going off in the world. I want to see you happily in fellowship as a contributor. 

**Trent**

That's only what I want.

**Randy Thomas**

I think we need to leave it at that. You know what we've left it at here. But we're here to help you. What we'd like you to do is go through and you know, just put it out. Don't do it in a defensive spirit, okay? Be before the Lord. You might write it out. You might come back to it and write it again. I don't care how many times you have to write it out. What we want to do is get it all out.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3597s)

Like you alluded to the son in Luke 15, he said, "I'm not worthy to be called thy son." 

**Randy Thomas**

And he was clothed in the best robe. 

**Greg Baldwin**

“Make me as one of the hired servants.” Do you think he was any less in the sight of his father? Do you think you'd be any less in the sight of Mr. Hales if you just capitulated? 

**Trent**

No

**Dad**

I'll say, Greg, I know what his concern has been. I mean, besides this. That, to me, when I heard what you wrote, is stemming from something deeper.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3633s)

Yeah, I did. Everyone knows that. Serious underlying problems.

### [**Da**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3636s)**d**

I realize you need to get that done and get that clear as far as the business. But underneath, we've had talks and I've tried to help. Because, you know, going through that stage, the biggest fear is if people find out about my questions and hearing things.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3651s)

I wrote account of dozens of times…dozens and dozens of times.

**Dad**

And I said, no, you won't. We're here to reason. We're here to help. I'll take responsibility if I haven't taught you right. Okay? I feel bad if I haven't taught you. But I can tell he said I was brainwashed by the brethren. I was never brainwashed…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3667s)

Dad, I never said that. I never said that.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3669s)

I said, I stood by a conviction when I came to in 1985 when I was shut up. That Mr. Hales was the elect vessel, the next one. And I said, and we, Mom and I, I said, we're not brainwashed. We came to a judgment, and you know for 19 years we carried something about the whole LRP being rival. I said we almost went out of our minds in a holocaust. I told you, I said it was a holocaust. No reflection on…’cause our [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3700s) is totally reconciled. My father's death has brought in 100% reconciliation in our family. I mean, I'm thankful for that.  But I said…

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3710s)

Your father's death was the largest loss we've lost in this interchange and I'll say that from my heart.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3719s)

It brought our family back together. I can tell you. Okay. And I said, but, you know, don't... I'm not brainwashed by the brethren.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3734s)

I didn't say that. I just said it feels like something is brainwashed.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3738s)

But I said, we came to that conviction on our own. We weren't told by anybody. We came to that... We were shut up. Okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3745s)

I know. These doubts are different.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3747s)

We came to the conviction that if Mr. Symington was still in fellowship with these brethren, why are we out here? And I picked up the phone and called. And the Lord came in and recovered us in a week. I told him, I said, I'm speaking from my heart. I said, I'm speaking from experience. So never tell me that I am brainwashed by the brethren..

**Randy Thomas**

 I was out in 84\. We were out in 84\. 

**Dad**

…fundamental. 85, yeah, 86\. Right.

**Greg Baldwin**

 It's a tragedy. Sorry. 

**Dad**

That's real life experience. I said, I know I've been a failure. I've had a lot of mistakes and a lot of things to learn. But you're never going to convince me that the position is wrong.

**Trent**

I wasn't trying…

**Dad**

You know, I'm just trying to help. I was just trying to help. 

**Trent**

You know, I appreciate that.

**Dad**

…and he said, I mean, he said, you know, you'd be scared to say anything. I said, no, you're not. You don't have to be scared. Tell it. Just tell it. It’s better to talk it out.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3801s)

I'll tell you right now. Mr Hales is the most fair man you'll ever meet. And you want to know something? These brethren are here to be fair to you. That's what I'm asking for you. All I'm going to say is that for your sake, I'd like you to go down on your knees tonight. 

**Trent**

I will

**Randy Thomas**

I'm pleading for you. Think about it this way. It's a life and death matter. Tomorrow's work doesn't matter. Tomorrow's... don't worry beyond tomorrow. You're at a moment today where you need to think.

**Dad**

That's right.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3844s)

I just want to ask you a couple questions. Do you have any doubts about the Lord Jesus?

**Trent**

 No. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Do you know that Mr. Hales is the Lord's great servant here on earth?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3859s)

I had doubts about that at one point…

**Greg Baldwin**

But you couldn't...

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3864s)

I know Greg, I understand the magnitude of what I'm saying.

**Greg Baldwin**

Just listen, you lead those thoughts captive. You judge those immediately.

**Dad**

That’s what I told him. I said they are poison.

**Greg Baldwin**

 You don't give them... you literally... I remember my mom telling me about PL. What would you do? I just want to give you the scenario. She spoke about PL saying it. If you were walking down the street and there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3894s) a really awful, nasty looking person coming to you that looked like they might harm you, what would you do? 

**Trent**

You'd pray. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Yeah, but you'd do that. 

**Trent**

You'd run away. 

**Greg Baldwin**

You might run away or cross over the other side of the street, right? 

**Trent**

Yeah. 

**Greg Baldwin**

So it's really like a wrong thought. You have to deal with it immediately or it will harm you. 

**Dad**

Well, the other thing, too, I've told him…

**Greg Baldwin**

It's torment. A doubt is torment. 

**Dad**

I don't know because he hasn't told me anything. I said, but there are persons out there that are apostate. And he knows I've been very straight about this. That are giving persons links in different things that are going to work. I don't know what it is.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3938s)

It wasn't that. Just get that out of the way.

### **Dad**

I said it's poison\!

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3941s)

I haven't been poisoned by an outside. 

**Dad**

I said, it's poison. 

**Randy Thomas**

Have you been in contact with those? 

**Dad**

And don't read anything…

**Trent** 

No, absolutely not. 

**Dad**

Don't even read anything about them. 

**Trent**

There's no merit to anything they're saying. It's false.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3953s)

Because I asked you I said, going out the door, I said… do you wanna leave?

**Trent**

I just want clarification about…

**Dad**

I said, I don't want you to leave, but is that what you want? Where would you go? Right? Where would you go?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3964s)

…some things I've noticed just as a humble young person who, as we've heard, knows nothing.

**Randy Thomas**

I don’t think…

### [**Greg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3972s) **Baldwin**

The older you get, the more you realize. In truth. You know, when you're younger you're...And I do…

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3982s)

I was invincible as a young person. I know it. I know I was invincible.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=3986s)

The world is... the world is swinging by the tail. But the older you get, I think your father could probably join in this with me, the older you get, the less you realize. I think one of these men said the less you realize you actually know.

**Trent**

 I know.

**Dad**

Well, the thing I tried to help you about is that you still respect the personnel as well. But Mr. Hales said the personnel may have failed. The Lord could even use a vessel. Not the [Lord's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4016s) vessel, not the elect vessel. 

**Randy Thomas**

The elect vessel can never fail. 

**Dad**

That's right. But he's used other, like Mr. Hales has borne with, he saw the whole LRP thing and Jerry Holman and persons that he's allowed to go on that weren't right. And you might say, well, why did you do that? Well, that's his patience. That's his grace. That's what Ben told you. Ben said, the assembly itself is perfect in itself. We have to come up to that.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4044s)

It does not need defending. The assembly is its own perfect…

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4048s)

The personnel may need adjustment. I need adjustment. 

**Dad**

We had a family discussion about it to try to get help.

**Trent** 

It was very candid. 

**Dad**

Yeah. And Ben said, hey, the assembly is right. Mr. Hales is right. And personnel may have failed. Don't claim by that…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4064s)

That was the biggest help. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Cling to that. 

**Trent**

It's just upsetting when this happens. 

**Dad**

But that's what my legal…

**Trent**

 Put yourself in my shoes. Okay, besides all the bullshit I wrote, which there was plenty of.

### **Dad**

But that's the seriousness of it, though. 

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4077s)

Do you realize that would have put pressure on Mr. Hales.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4081s)

I think it would have. 

**Dad**

I know it would have. 

**Greg Baldwin**

But that's what I would…

**Dad**

I know it would have.

**Greg Baldwin**

I would humble myself. 

**Trent**

Did this get to Mr. Hales? I would love to speak to him. As much as I wouldn't want to burden him.

**Randy Thomas**

I would love.. I would love you to think…

### [**Greg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4093s) **Baldwin**

But I think if you write that letter, I would have no doubt in my mind…

**Randy Thomas & Greg Baldwin & Dad**

That'll go straight to him. It'll go straight to him. It'll go straight to him.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4100s)

I will insure you from myself…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4103s)

Okay. I don't know.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4104s)

…all I'm saying is when we came in here…

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4107s)

I've never lied to you on that note, have I? 

**Trent**

No, you haven't. 

**Greg Baldwin**

I've never lied to you on that note, have I? 

**Trent**

No, you haven't.

**Greg Baldwin**

 Okay. Will you trust me this time? I'll trust you, Greg. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Okay. Okay. We're here to help.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4120s)

Trying to work through something and I told you my concern is that somebody or something, and I'm not saying this in any mean way, I've gone through it myself, somebody is trying to poison you.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4133s)

Have you read anything online or just what?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4137s)

No. It's just been months and years of observing. I'm very, very analytical and inquisitive. Maybe that's a bad thing. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4150s)

It's life and death. It's life and death for you, your family. It’s life and death…

### **Greg Baldwin**

So just tell your mind what to think. You know what's right.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4154s)

We might not understand what's happened in the past, what’s happened now.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4157s)

That’s what Mr Hales said. Tell your mind what to think.

**Trent**

But my mind sees that as just another brainwashing technique.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4160s)

…what we're dealing with right here is something that's come across, illegal.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4161s)

It's not brainwashing.

**Randy Thomas**

That's all I'm asking. Please

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4165s)

Faith is needed. What you're missing is faith and confidence. You know what I mean? If you reason things naturally.

**Dad**

We’re trying to work with you. I mean we're trying to work with ourselves. 

We're trying to work every day and help. We're going over scriptures and helping reinforce ourselves that the testimony is right. We can’t believe lies\!

**Randy Thomas**

The testimony can’t, the testimony is 100% right.

**Dad**

I shouldn’t have a shadow of doubt in my mind. 

**Greg Baldwin**

I remember being…

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4193s)

What I wanna do. I want to help you. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it.

**Greg Baldwin**

……cling to one thing that I don’t have any doubt that Mr Hales is the Lord’s servant and just cling to that one thing…

### **Randy Thomas**

We have to work together. If we're going to save our own locality. We're going to save our franchise. If we're going to save our own soul.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4210s)

…just cling to it…don’t allow…as soon as that thought comes in, just challenge it.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4211s)

What we're dealing with here is not when Mick and Rod called in they were not about the point of a doubt. Put the doubt behind us. Put all that behind us. What we're talking about is we're talking about something that came across that, as we explained it with your father's business, your father would have taken legal action against Greg if that had happened. 

**Greg Baldwin**

I would fully expect that. 

**Trent**

It would have scared us. 

**Randy Thomas**

Exactly. And you know what? I'm asking for you to write something down.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4241s)

…you know, if I was hacking into things and taking, you know, proprietary information from you. 

**Randy Thomas**

Or even if I said that I was. 

**Greg Baldwin**

I'm just saying, if I said I was, you would contact a lawyer. 

**Trent**

I fully understand. 

**Greg Baldwin**

You wouldn't just say Greg's a buffer. You might.

**Trent**

No, I fully understand. 

**Randy Thomas**

You might. You wouldn't just say Greg's a 40-year-old that's just having a bit of a fun time, or he's an 18-year-old. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Because actually, if I put this little noodle to work, and that's what I was minded to do…

**Trent**

 You could do it.

**Greg Baldwin**

 I would figure it out. Yeah. Okay. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4269s)

I tell you right now. If I put my wet noodle together, I would never figure it out.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4275s)

Yeah, if I got determined enough, I would. I just would because I'm analytical too. But I'm telling you, the one thing I've learned in my own history is you tell your mind what to think. The devil introduces all kinds of falsehoods. He could have you look at this brother, that brother, and think all kinds of unfair things.

**Dad**

That’s right.

**Greg Baldwin**

But you know what, when you judge yourself, you'll become generous in your own heart and you'll say, you know what, I love [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4305s) brother because of whatever, whatever attribute of Christ that you see in that brother, that's what you'll love. You're not going to be focusing on his shortcomings. That's the devil's work, is to get you to think ill of the Lord's people.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4324s)

Think of what Mr. Hales said. We're not disappointed with your histories. What it is, is let's put it behind us. Let's take it. I don't think it's after 12 o'clock now. I think that what needs to happen tonight is that you need to get down on your knees, pray, read a preaching of our brother’s, write something down on paper and go over it, and over it, add to it, shred it, write it again, whatever has to happen. But I'm asking that you do this before 8 o'clock tomorrow morning. 

**Trent**

I will.

### **Randy Thomas**

I'm pleading for your soul. 

**Trent**

It's just so... 

### **Randy Thomas**

Think about it from their side as we just explained it out to you.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4369s)

Stop thinking. You're overthinking.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4371s)

Don't..It’s not… 

**Dad**

You're overthinking. 

**Randy Thomas**

If Greg had done it to your business. 

**Dad**

You are overthinking from the standpoint of…

**Trent**

It's a scare tactic. 

**Randy Thomas**

It's not. If Greg had done this to your business.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4380s)

### You're overthinking from the standpoint, oh, well, these guys are important and they're just coming down…

**Trent**

They are\!

**Dad**

The seriousness of what you did there is very, very very serious.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4388s)

Do you realize they're giving you an amnesty?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4389s)

It's serious to me, as for the testimony. 

**Trent**

They're not. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4395s)

They're giving you an amnesty. They're giving you until 8 o'clock.

**Trent**

I have an amnesty because I'm innocent. 

**Randy Thomas**

They're giving you until 8 o'clock in the morning. I'll tell you right now, I thought I was innocent in one thing. I took my citizenship in 2002\. Listen me out. No. Listen me out. I took my citizenship in 2002\. I thought I was 100% innocent. I never filed a US tax return until 2007, and I was granted an amnesty by the US government to pull it up. And what they said is that if you take US citizenship, every single year, whether you've made a dime or not, if you have a social security number and you've taken citizenship, you have got to fill out a U.S. tax return. And you know something? I didn't know. Our lawyers didn't know. Our accountants didn't know.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4451s)

Oh my goodness.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4452s)

The government issued me an amnesty. I cleared it up in 2007\. I did every single one. I actually made a refund out of it, but I cleared it up. Done. Never gone back. That's a government issuing you an amnesty because there was an unclear portion of the law that we didn't understand. And no one understood it. What I'm saying is you've written something. If this had been your father's business, your father found out that Greg had done this or Greg had written this. Your father could have called the police and done one thing. He could have called the police…

**Trent**

Given them the evidence.

### **Randy Thomas**

 …given them the evidence, and Greg would be sitting in jail right this minute. He would be sitting in jail and they'd question it and interrogate it later.

**Trent**

They absolutely wouldn’t.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4504s)

All your father would have to do is show that to the police and they literally…

**Dad**

Yes they would, yes, they would until you went to court to show evidence that you didn't do it. 

**Trent**

No.

**Dad**

They’d say we have minutes of what you wrote here that you did.

**Randy Thomas**

You wrote that you did.

**Dad**

 So we'll lock you up until you can prove you didn’t.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4521s)

No. Not in this case Have you seen the amount of things that are... I don't want to defend myself on this. Here I go again.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4530s)

Ok, you are wrong. So what I've said to you before is that it's a deeper matter.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4534s)

But what they said is unequivocally false. 

**Randy Thomas**

Okay, but you've put something down in writing. You've put something down in writing. You say…

**Dad**

You've put it in writing. 

**Randy Thomas**

You said…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4543s)

The judge doesn't care what you put in writing. 

**Dad**

It's not the point

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4546s)

When it's in black and white... 

**Dad**

The more serious thing…

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4549s)

That's probable cause, but there's no evidence. 

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4554s)

No, the more serious thing is why. The more serious thing in my mind is why.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4556s)

There's always two sides to any legal battle, and it's just a huge scare tactic.

**Dad**

You are not getting it. 

**Randy Thomas**

 It's not a huge scare tactic. 

**Trent**

You know how much of the brethren's money they would waste trying to pursue a 19-year-old?

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4565s)

That’s not the point. 

**Greg Baldwin**

But you know what? They don't want to do that, but they would have to by law.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4571s)

They wouldn't do it. They wouldn't do it. They would contact the cybersecurity team, and they would look at it and say, this is utter nonsense. It's impossible. It's a fairy tale.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4580s)

No that’s not…I'm telling you right now. I'm telling you right now.

**Dad**

I wouldn’t play games.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4583s)

I'm not trying to play games, but they're so naive.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4589s)

No, no. it’s what would happen? What will happen. I'm going to tell you what will happen.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4592s)

I'm going to do what they want.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4594s)

I'm asking and I'm pleading with you to cry out to the Lord. What will happen is if something doesn't come through and you're not free to put something on paper. You're not free to get right about this. Not free to put your name to it. 

They will have no choice but what any other large corporation would do but contact the police. You can deal with that. You can deal with that. If you want to deal with that on that side, that's not me. That's not Greg. That's not your father. [That's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4624s) you dealing with the cops. Whether they put you in jail or whatever, that's you. That's not us.

### **Trent**

I see where everyone's coming from. 

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4628s)

Just let your loyalty, just let your loyalty to the CEO be your guide. 

**Trent**

I don't think Mr. Hales would have that spirit. There's no way. 

**Greg Baldwin**

Mr. Hales would have to, speaking carefully. Not that I can… I can’t put a word in his mouth. 

**Dad**

Okay, regardless of that, it's inconsequential. The fact is what you wrote ..

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4652s)

I won’t be restful until I speak to Mr. Hales.

**Dad**

 But what you wrote is more serious. 

**Trent**

Not through Mick, not through Rod, not through these multi-millionaire guys flying around on private jets. 

**Randy Thomas**

I'm not a multi-millionaire flying around on a private jet.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4666s)

All they do is spend their time for the brethren.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4676s)

…Rod’s a fair businessman but Mick is…

**Greg Baldwin**

 But, you know, I'm not up to his caliber. So I'll take low ground on that.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4676s)

I'm not one of them. I can't threaten people with legal teams.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4678s)

No, but those brothers.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4680s)

I wrote it in the messages. I said, watch. They'll take this. Because I'm not naive.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4691s)

But you're provoking them. That to me. It's much more serious.

**Trent**

 I'm trying to prove…

**Dad**

 No. What you're doing. I told you before, now that I see what you did, what you've done is tried to provoke them because underneath there's something that's poisoning you and it's satanic.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4706s)

Remember, it's a separate issue.

**Dad**

 I don't care. But it's underlying.

**Trent**

 Have we or have we not decided it's a separate issue?

**Dad**

 It's a separate issue. 

**Trent**

Legal and moral. 

**Dad**

Okay, but clear out the legal. But the fact is... 

**Trent**

The legal's not cleared up.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4717s)

The legal will get clear.

**Dad**

 You can clear it up. 

**Randy Thomas**

You can clear the legal.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4722s)

Because it's an utter fairy tale and they know it. It's a scare tactic to get me into…

**Dad**

No, you clear that up.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4727s)

There's no scare tactic into you getting morally right. There's no scare tactic into you getting this moral.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4732s)

Lawyers always use one thing first. Always, always, always. 

**Dad**

Yeah but the fact is…

**Trent**

They just go for the scare tactic. The formal letter, the formal conference call. You've talked to me. I’ve talked to plenty of lawyers.

**Dad**

Yeah, but listen to me. I'm trying to help you.

**Trent**

 I'm just saying it's a fairy tale. It's a witch hunt.

### **Dad**

No. You put it right, okay?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4749s)

I'll put it right.

**Dad**

You put it right. What I’m saying is it’s deeper…

**Trent**

What they did was not the spirit of Mr. Hales. 

**Dad**

OK. Leave that with the Lord. 

**Trent**

And that I will fully…

**Dad**

Leave it with the Lord. Don't worry about that. 

**Trent**

I'll say that until the day I die. 

**Dad**

Don't worry about that.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4762s)

That's not your matter. 

**Dad**

That's not your matter.

**Greg Baldwin**

 That's not your matter.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4768s)

Can you see how for a young person it's upsetting?

**Dad**

 But that's your hang-up.

**Trent**

It's just confirming all my suspicions.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4768s)

But suspicions aren't from the Lord.

**Dad**

That's exactly right.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4772s)

I don't know where they're from.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4776s)

JSH said…

**Dad**

 I told you that.

**Greg Baldwin**

 I'd rather... And this rings in my ears.

**Dad**

 I told you that. 

**Greg Baldwin**

JSH said I'd rather be deceived than be suspicious. 

**Dad**

These are the type of things that he's been hung up about.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4788s)

Look at Mr. John Hales.

**Trent**

 I've been deceived. 

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4788s)

Look at Mr. John Hales. Mr. John Hales was put out of fellowship for how many years? Do you think there was any vindictive spirit in him? There wasn't one vindictive bone.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4800s)

I'm not Mr. John Hales.

**Dad**

 We went over that V-17. I tried to help you. We went over that V-17. It said, Stephen was out of fellowship, Mr. Stephen. Mr. Hales. And what did he say? And the fact that he said 20 years will be the same, I said, okay, the brethren whoever, the personnel, whoever was involved was wrong in what they did. But I said, doesn't that confirm you that Mr. Hales is...

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4821s)

I'm getting confirmed on that. 

**Randy Thomas**

Mr Hales was right.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4825s)

…the assembly was right, the men was just…

**Trent**

 But the personnel…

**Dad**

It just makes you feel so...

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4828s)

Leave personal issues behind, okay?

**Dad**

And leave those..

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4833s)

I'll never go to Mick's house again. 

**Dad**

Because you don't like these VIPs?

**Trent**

He’s official. Mr Hales just brought out about officialism. I can see officialism, especially in this locality.

**Dad**

 I realize that, OK.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4845s)

I'm not trying to be official.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4847s)

You're not.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4848s)

Greg's not trying to be official here. We're trying to help you. What I'm trying to say… What I'm trying to say here, put everything aside. Who, think of it from this side. Who was the one person that instigated everything tonight?

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4869s)

It was me. I'm not denying that.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4874s)

Think about what you said. I don't want to sit here all night and pressure you. I want you to think about this. We did not write it. I didn't write it. Greg didn't write it. Your father didn't write it. You wrote it. It's something that you put out of your heart. Now you know what you have to do if, because the fact is you're saying that what you've done is you've told a lie. That's what you told them. You said [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4904s) them, "I've told a lie." How do they know from the sense of having to protect their clients?

**Trent**

They don't. 

**Randy Thomas**

Just one second. They've got to protect their clients the same as your father would protect his own business.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4922s)

I fully, fully agree. And in fact, this is going to sound very... It's going to sound terrible. I'm helping them in a very, very roundabout weird way, dad, they're going to go back, they're going to hire a cybersecurity team, they're going to lock down their systems, they're going to figure their problems out.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4942s)

That's beside the point. The fact is...

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4945s)

But it's well, well, well besides the point. I fully agree. There's fatal flaws in the brethren's privacy is at serious risk. And obviously, from the things they're saying, they're clueless. Maybe they need to hire me.

**Dad**

Maybe. 

**Trent**

Maybe. Oh, but you think that's going to happen? No, I know, but it's besides the point.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4968s)

You need to get the doubts out and the poison out…the truth…

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4974s)

All I ask is, we are talking two different issues.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4974s)

We are, I know.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4978s)

But one thing I will say…

**Dad**

…some information poisoned you.

**Randy Thomas**

 …is something is taking you away from your love for the brethren. There's some doubt in your mind. 

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4991s)

There's a doubt.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4993s)

But there's a doubt in your mind.

**Dad**

 But it's very serious.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4993s)

And the doubt is leading you to do something else.

**Dad**

But it’s extremely serious

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=4998s)

Saying it's serious over and over does not help me get settled. I know it's serious. I know the magnitude of what I've been saying. I'm not naive. I know the jaw-dropping, ballsy things I've been saying.

### [**Randy Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5013s)

All I can say, I think it's fair to say that we should keep going tonight. Yeah.

**Dad**

We'll need to work through it.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5019s)

Don't try to be shocking, okay?

**Trent**

I'm not... 

**Greg Baldwin**

Do you know what I'm saying?

**Dad**

We're trying to work through it. 

**Greg Baldwin**

If you lead every thought captive, you get to the Lord about every little weird little thing that comes into your head, every little conspiracy, every suspicion, and you get to the Lord and you ask him whether you're right. You ask him to help.

**Randy Thomas**

The Lord will explain it to you

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5055s)

ou know, I've tried…

**Greg Baldwin**

But your faith... faith isn't failure. Faith is for the impossible. 

**Dad**

You have to believe.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5055s)

I've done it.

### [**Dad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5056s)

Well then believe it.

### [**Trent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5059s)

I will.

### [**Greg Baldwin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5059s)

You know, when that little thought comes in your mind, you know of Rod Diplock or this stuff…

**Trent**

We're going to get this fixed. 

**Dad**

We’re going to get this fixed. I can agree with that.

**Randy Thomas**

Let's decide this.

**Greg Baldwin**

We would be leap years in.

**Dad**

I said, you know what the devil would like to do this.

**Trent**

It’s clearly… 

(Recording ends)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5077s)

So that was the priestly visit. Wow, wow, wow. What did you think Richard?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5086s)

It's just... It's so disgusting, and it's really, really hard to listen to. For anyone who's been inside the church, this will all be quite familiar. But to those of you who've never been part of the PBCC, of the Plymouth Brethren, this is going to come as a punch in the gut, because this is behind this veneer of loving Christianity and family is at the [heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5116s) of all that we do. And, you know, they're wonderful, charitable. This is the real Plymouth Brethren Christian Church under Bruce Hales. This is the experience of almost every single member of this church is actually in the fear and grit of this kind of leadership. 

The thing that really struck me about this particular recording is that there's a pattern to it, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5146s) I had a priestly, as they call it, with Bruce Hales by phone. And this priestly was by phone. You probably understood that, that this was a young man sitting in the living room of his father's house with a number of local priests sitting with him. And the two guys actually conducting the interrogation, Mick Strange and Rod Diplock were just there by speakerphone. They weren't actually there in person. And I had the same experience. I had a priestly with Bruce Hales. And one thing that was a bit shocking to me is that there's no privacy in this. When I had this call with Bruce Hales, it touched on some very, very personal, sensitive subjects. And there's no privacy. There were multiple other people on the line. I don't know who they were. They were [other,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5206s) you know, important brethren who were, so to speak, in the waiting room on a multiple person call waiting for their turn to discuss priestly matters.

So when I got on the phone, I was listening to other people having priestly interviews, priestly interrogations, talking about their personal matters. And then when it comes to my turn, everything I say, everything that's disclosed is heard by multiple [people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5238s) And the thing that really struck me listening to this is the formula, the recipe for it is exactly the same as what Bruce Hales does. And I can tell you why, because Brent Scott, who was one of my priests, he was from Oxbow in Canada, he told me that he learned to do priestly interrogations from Bruce Hales by being on [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5268s) joint calls.

So Bruce's tactic is when he does this kind of grilling and bullying of people, he has a bunch of other, you know, brethren leaders, brethren priests on the call so they can learn from his interrogation technique, basically how to intimidate and brainwash people. And you know, we learned this from the top. This is how Bruce does it. And I identified like [four,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5298s) four parts to the recipe, four ingredients to the recipe that are common to what Bruce Hales said to me and what Mick Strange said to this teenager that was being beaten up.

And the first thing, point one is, they intimidate you. They say, if you get up against us, we're going to crush you. And the [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5328s) it was, I mean, we heard what Mick Strange said multiple times. He said, if you get up against us, we will go to the ultimate ends to smash you. I forget his exact words, but he's very, very emphatic that if you want to pick a fight with us, you're going to be crushed. What Bruce Hales said to me, he said to me, he was alluding to boxing or wrestling and he's and I'd never made the least [suggestion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5358s) about getting up against him. I was just saying yes Mr. Hales, yes Mr. Hales like wishing it was over. He says you get up against me I'll knock you out in the first round. I'll knock you out in the first round. Do you hear?

 So wow, very similar wording. You know, he kind of implies that you want to pick a fight and says if you get up against me I'm just going to smash you.

And then the next, so that's item one, is that they say, if you get up against us, we're going to smash you. And they kind of emphasize how powerful and dominant they are.

So that's number one ingredient in the recipe, is intimidation. Number two ingredient is insults.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5412s)

This didn't have anything short of them. It was every sentence almost had some sort of an insult towards him. You're stupid, you're useless, you're naive.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5420s)

And it's repeated and it's repeated. It's just rammed down your throat. You're an utterly worthless piece of crap. Now we heard what Mick said. So what Bruce Hales said to me, he says; 

“You're a dope. Do hear me? You're just an immoral dope.”

 So again, it's the you know, the crude, the crude insults, the playground bully insults. So that's [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5450s) item number two in in Bruce Hales's interrogation recipe.

 Item number three is an interesting one, which is blaming and insulting the parents. Yeah. And you know, I've heard this from other interrogations and this is a Bruce Hales tactic. And obviously in in Mick Strange's case, he was saying, you know, your father, your father hasn't been able to persuade you that the brethren or hasn't taught you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5481s)

Yeah, hasn't taught you properly.

### **Richard Marsh**

Yeah. And of course it instantly brings a reaction and I think that's the intention because you know, I think children have a very deeply rooted instinct to defend their parents. Even a teenager who may spend most of his time saying how awful his parents are, when his parents are actually insulted, they will stand up and defend them. It's the family. It's the family honor, if you like. And this is, I believe this is [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5511s) direct attack, very strategic attack on family ties.

Your loyalty to the brethren has to be greater than your loyalty to the family. And it's exactly the opposite of what the brethren claim. They claim that family is at the heart of all that they do and all that they believe. Well, the fact is they always work on weakening those family ties and emphasizing that your loyalty to Bruce Hales, the CEO, has to become way ahead of any loyalty to [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5548s) members. So they always try and attack and weaken and your closest ties. And of course, for a teenager who's not married, his closest family links are to his parents.

So that is a Bruce Hales tactic, to insult your family and to kind of imply that not only are you a worthless piece of shit, but you come from a shitty family, you come from a bad family, there's nothing of any worth of value in you at all. And then finally the last part of the recipe is to dangle you over hell. And again Bruce Hales says to me, he says, you better pray [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5590s) don't go to hell.

And again this, you know, again from other accounts of interrogations, this is Bruce Hales practice. So there's one, two, three, four points. This is Bruce Hales recipe for kind of crushing and smashing up someone who he you know, he basically wants to bring into subjection or he wants to break.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5618s)

And you hear that a lot in that podcast. It was like, hit the deck, hit the deck, which I mean, you hear the teenager getting so frustrated with what does that mean?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5629s)

Boy, hit the deck, boy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5632s)

Yeah. And then it was Greg that I said, put your hackles down and just collapse, right. Yeah. Don't defend yourself. Well, they're sitting there telling this poor dude that they're going to go to the police, but yet he's not allowed to defend himself because he's got a defensive spirit is what they said. Yeah. Like, and that's exactly what he's getting frustrated with. He's frustrated the whole thing was like, how do I tell them the truth without being defensive? Because and so this was such a tactic that was used in our family [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5662s) sometimes three, four times a week. And it was so triggering for me. The very first time I heard this audio, oh, it threw me for a loop. And it is, it's one of those things why I just get so triggered by gaslighting men, people that don't sit down and truly listen to somebody who's saying something or bringing something up.

We were accused of so many things. So Maurice Hope's daughters, and we would have James and Ruth's daughters would sit there and watch every movement. And same with the Harry and Mary's kids. They would watch our entire movement and then we'd get priestly visits. But we weren't allowed to say that we didn't do it because exactly what you heard was what would happen. And then [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5706s) would attack my dad. And that's where I got so hurt. I would get stopped on my paper route. I'd have priestly visits from Maurice Hope one-on-one on the side of a road from him over what I was doing to my dad and how I was making my dad worthless. And I was going to take my dad to hell.

And I mean, when they instill this over and over and over, you start believing it. It hits you. It crushes your spirit. It literally crushes your spirit until you get to the point where you're like, you're done. You are just so [done.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5736s) And that's what happened to me at 16 when we had had such a priestly visit where I was like, I was taking my own life, right? I was like, Like there was no way that I wasn't there for my dad anymore. I felt that there was no way that I was going to endure any more of this abuse. On top of the abuse that I'd already endured was like, I'm out.

So this is pastoral care. What you listen to is pastoral care. Calling someone over and over stupid, dumb, [naive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5767s) idiot. And then you get to the end of the podcast where we have Randy and Greg trying to round everything up. And telling them over and over, they're reiterating everything and then say, no, you need to put this in your own words. You need to put this in your own words. Meanwhile, this poor dude has just had someone rammed down his throat that he's stupid.

Like, I don't think people understand. If you've never gone through these priestly visits, you'll never understand the absolute gymnastics your mind does. Like, I was so inside this teenager. I so related to it because it's literally the toxic tactics that have been used from day one over and over is how can we get you to surrender so that you chop off your head. You're not thinking anything and you're [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5818s) surrendering to whatever everybody above you is saying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5822s)

I mean, it's a recipe for suicide. It's a recipe to drive. 100%. It's insanely cruel. Yeah. I mean I made a few more notes when I was listening to this and how would you even describe Mick Strange? Arrogant, sadistic, cruel. I mean, he's enjoying this, isn't he? Mick's enjoying this. He's actually getting a pleasure out of the pain that he's inflicting on this kid. And like the haughty, sneering arrogance of a man. I mean, what a repulsive person Mick Strange is. And I just kind of thought, Mick Strange is like the poster boy. You know, he's the poster boy for the Bruce Hales administration. [He's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5874s) insanely rich. He's got this massive, massive business, probably the biggest brethren business in North America.

It's actually Greg Hales who is Bruce Hales' third son is a director of Allfasteners. So I imagine it's actually Greg Hales' business and Mick's just one of the top guys in there. So he's right in there. He's in business with one of Bruce Hales' sons which is like as high as you can get unless you're actually a Hales yourself.

And he was, you know, he grew up in Sydney. He was sent over to North America as part of Bruce Hales' kind of campaign to bring the USA under his control. USA has always been very resistant to the whole Hales brand. And so going back 20 years, Bruce Hales sent quite a lot of very arrogant young men to actually move to the USA and to different brethren [congregations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5939s) in the USA to take control of the country. And Mick Strange moved to Cleveland, which is where he is, where his house and his business is. And you know, he he basically is that represents the leadership class in in the USA. The leadership is is pretty much in the hands of Australians, Bruce Hales's Australians who've moved in and and run the place.

But you know, just [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=5969s) you, you know, insiders who are listening to this, Mick Strange is a role model for your children. Do you want your children to grow up and be like Mick Strange? With that sadistic, arrogant, haughty attitude? Is that your goal for your children? Is that what you'd like to see your children grow up like? That kind of character and personality? Because Mick Strange has patterned and modelled himself on Bruce Hales. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6000s) if you're going to toe the Brethren line and respect the whole Hales ecosystem, the Hales leadership, then you're going to have to pattern yourself after Mick Strange. I mean, can you think of anything less Christian, less loving, less attractive than Mick Strange?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6023s)

He gaslights the entire way, right? How his dad starts sticking up for his son and then Mick's like, he's not coming across in that spirit. He's sitting there, this poor teenager sitting there taking this abuse from him. And he refers to it many times after they hang up about how that wasn't done in the spirit of the Lord. That wasn't done in the spirit of Bruce Hales, that it was a witch hunt. And yet they're all telling, they're telling this teenager to all put that aside, put that aside, give that to the Lord, [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6053s) that to the Lord. Yet you got to understand what this teenager is just going through in his mind.

So Mick was allowed, Mick and Rod were allowed to give this priestly visit, call him all those names, not sit down and offer any kind of compassion, not listening to what he's doing. He knows what he has done is not illegal at all. I mean, they're obviously just very paranoid about whatever in UBT they were hiding. And I mean, now the ATO raids have happened. We're sitting on this whole other [side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6084s) of things. And we're like, well, what were you hiding, Mick? What didn't you want him to get a hold of, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6090s)

But it comes down to the absolute gaslighting maneuver of them allowing these priests to come in and do what they did. Nobody stopped them. I mean, the dad did try here and there, right? The dad did try and then at the very end he's told to just leave that with the Lord and that was probably the most triggering thing for me because that's what my sister told me. And I want to tell you insiders and to the ex-members that say, oh, you know [what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6120s) You just leave this with the Lord. The Lord's got it. Blah, blah, blah, blah. That's bullshit. We are in a physical body to take action and to stop shit that goes down.

If I had someone send me an audio of this of a niece or nephew of mine, you bet your ass I would stand up and I would fight for them. Because at some point, people need to stand up and start saying no. You don't just say the Lord's got it. No, what action do you have in [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6150s) power to maneuver and change the way things are going? The gaslighting has to stop. What Mick, Rod and I'm going to include Greg and Randy did in here was detrimental to the development of a teenager. I know this because I stood in that position and literally had created a suicide poem note that I was going to take my life because of the priestly visits I had had that didn't even have to do with the abuse that I [endured.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6181s)

It was the priestly visits on top of it when I knew Maurice Hope knew what I went through. Like at some point these priestly visits have to change. They have to change. You can't, do not allow your children, don't allow if things like this start going down, stop it. Stop it dead in its track. This is not pastoral care. This is absolutely the furthest thing from pastoral care.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6208s)

Yeah, and this is not an exceptional priestly visit. This is not unusual. This is a normal priestly visit with all the usual ingredients to the recipe. And I can promise you there's like 300 brethren congregations worldwide and and tonight, today there will be, I'm guessing at least 300 of these priestly interviews, priestly visits happening this very day and every day of the [week.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6238s) I mean, this this happens all the time, particularly to teenagers. I mean, when I was, when I was younger, this was much less common. You know, you might have a few priestly visits, but by the time my children were teenagers, this was happening all the time.

You know, the priest would just call around, no no announcement, they'd turn up, they'd knock on your door, oh, we need to have a talk to your daughter. And so your 14, 15 year old [daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6268s) would would meekly trot out the door, get in a car with a couple of middle-aged guys and they'd just drive off with her. And you know, to and that they would interrogate her typically in in their business premises which were all empty because it would be like after hours, it'd be late evening. So they'd take her off their business premises, interrogate the poor girl for an hour and then they'd drop her back at the house in tears. Yeah, we're done with her now. And then next week, same thing happens. This [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6298s) happening right now all around the world in every brethren congregation.

And I mean, the whole thing about Christianity is supposed to be that your pastors, your leaders, they love you. Did you really get the impression that Mick Strange loves this young man? Do you think Bruce Hales loves you? I mean, you people, you you brethren inside there, do you really believe that your leaders love you? Now, let me tell you, they despise you. They think you're the [lowest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6328s) of the low. I mean, ask yourself, does a pig farmer love his pigs? Because that's what you are. You're just pig farm. Oh, yeah, they love the money they can make from the pigs. But if a pig gets sick and it becomes a liability, they're just going to go out there and shoot it, chuck the body on the garbage heat. Like wake up, guys. These people do not love you. They're not Christians and this is not Christianity.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6353s)

Yeah, you haven't experienced what love is. And that was one of the things that I wanted to bring up is the brainwashing of we love you. But like this is where I hold, I hold Greg and Randy accountable because they were the local priests that were in that room. They should have stop that. But as you see very at the very end Greg, Greg says, I'm not up to his caliber, referring to Mick. And it shows you how the hierarchy is established, right? So they know that they are not above or even in the same lane as Rod and Mick.

But how is this teenager supposed to feel safe in these priests care when they don't, when they sit there allow, like to call a 18 year old, 19 year old over and over, tell him he's dumb, over and over, tell him he's stupid, that he's naive, he's an idiot, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6406s) that should have been stopped the first time that came out through their mouth. And Greg and Randy should have been responsible for that. They were the ones in that, they were the ones that were the priests holding that space there. They should have cut that off right away. That should not have been allowed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6420s)

We talk about hierarchy. This is exactly what the hierarchy is. You've got Bruce Hales at the top. You've got his his nasty little minions, his like personal bodyguard, which is people like Mick Strange that are strategically located all around the world. And and and then under that, you've got your local priests and they're terrified of the next level up. I mean, Greg and Greg and Randy, give them some credit. You know, I think they genuinely did, like they were genuinely [wanting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6450s) to help this guy, absolutely. But they were too terrified of the next level up. They couldn't contradict him because then they would get kicked out. So there's this fear all the way down the, all the way down the chain. Mick is terrified of Bruce Hales. The local priests are terrified of Mick. The teenager's dad is terrified of the local priest because they're the people who can kick him out on the garbage. And the poor kid at the bottom is is terrified of all of them. It's a pyramid of fear.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6482s)

He's trying to constantly tell him about everything, all the work he's been doing with his son, right? Yeah. And that totally remind, that remind me of our priest too, is like where the, you know, your parents are trying so hard to like make themselves look good because they need to look good in the eyes of the priest. And then so the priest come back and be like, well, you know, the parents are doing their job, but you know, it's just, it's just this child's issue, right? And it is, it's a sure thing. You really start to see. And I questioned myself while watching this again of like, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6513s) these parents actually, are they capable of fully caring and loving their children the way that we would have out here, right?

And I sat with it for a while and I was like, you know what, they actually aren't. They actually can't love their children the way that we would love our children, because that's not where that, that's not where their energy goes to. Their energy is always going above them. Right. It's the hierarchy system above them. And it's a sad situation, but you can really feel that. Like, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6544s) else are they able to just let go of their children? Right. So many parents have had to just let go of their children. Yes, it's going to hurt them. Yes, they're human. They still, they still cry. They still miss us. But for that parental light switch to be shut off, someone above them has to have a lot of power.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6562s)

A lot of power. Someone's pulled the fuse. Exactly. Yeah. And I mean, this is this is what actually happened. I mean, just to just to jump ahead a little bit, this young man who is anything but dumb, who is extremely capable, extremely intelligent and now has left the brethren. I mean, not surprisingly. And so his links, his parents have had to cut him off. His parents have had to pretend that he's dead and refuse to communicate with him because he's now an opposer. And so, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6592s) Mick Strange, Bruce Hales have pulled the fuse. That whole family relationship has been smashed and severed. And I mean, the young man has gone on to be highly successful. But what price can you put on that relationship that's just been unplugged? Yeah, it's just the same tragedy again and again, thousands and thousands of times over. Yeah, let's go into, let's dive.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6620s)

Into what they talk about with Mr. Hales in here. So they come right out and call, they say literally, they say that the UBT is Mr. Hales's business. So we've had the ATO tax rates happen.

### [**Priest**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6635s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6636s)

And we have this now in absolute black and white audio that people know that Mr. Hales's business is UBT. So have fun with that, Bruce Hales.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6647s)

I was inside. This is what was said. It's Bruce Hales's business. And Bruce Hales is the CEO. And I think actually on that audio, they refer to Bruce Hales as the CEO. And the thing that strikes me is when that ATO tax rate happened, the brethren spokesperson comes out and says, it's very sad that people get confused. I'm just putting it in my own words. UBT is just a business that's owned by brethren members. It doesn't actually belong to the [church.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6677s) But oh, when we get the inside story, it's different. Oh, this is Bruce Hales' business.

And just think about the context of this whole conversation. This is a business conversation between an employer and one of their employees about an alleged misuse of computer equipment. So Mick Strange, Rod Diplock, they are UBT directors. And then they're interviewing an [employee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6708s) who's allegedly done something wrong. So this is a business interview. Now, where else on the planet do you have a business interview where the employee is threatened with dangling in hellfire along with Pontius Pilate? And where else on the planet do you get a mainstream Christian church who kind of happens to also own the whole business to which every single member of that church has to [buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6738s) all their goods and services and IT?

And what you see here is there's absolutely no boundary or dividing line between the church, UBT as a business, and Bruce Hales' personal financial matters. It's all the same thing. Bruce Hales is the church. The UBT is the church. There's no boundary at all. Bruce Hales runs the Brethren basically as his own family business. Yeah. Under the guise of UBT.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6771s)

And we have it says right here. So this is the directors of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And here is Mick Strange, Rodney Diplock. They're both.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6780s)

Yeah. So they're right in the USA. They're right at the top of the pile. Mick Strange and Rod Diplock are the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in the USA. So this is like the highest level of influence. This isn't just some rogue guys in the church. This is what the church is. This is the very heart of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6801s)

And Mick Strange is also the director of the PBCC Charity Rapid Relief Team. So you have to understand that these people have their hands in everything. This is who, this is the face. This is the faces of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. And this is how they treat their flock.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6820s)

What's the RRT logo? Compassion in action. Compassion in action. Now, just listen to the Mick Strange and think “compassion in action.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6832s)

Yeah, not.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6833s)

Yeah. It's just so shocking, but it kind of speaks. It's kind of what can you say? The whole thing speaks for itself. I mean, you just listen to it and it gives you that sort of visceral understanding of what this, you know, what's really going on here. The other thing I want to say is that these guys have got multiple business connections for the Hales family. So take Allfasteners, which Mick Strange is running in the USA. That's Greg Hales' business. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6866s) premises is on Atkins Road.

And that actually adjoins the original Archway House business, which is Bruce Hales' business. I mean, this is where the Hales business empire is run from.

And Rod Diplock, he's got this business called ControlTek, which is all about cash handling, which must be a very useful business to be in if you're associated with the Hales. But he's also a director of Shivano Consulting, which is Gareth Hales' international property investment business. And we know from the recent ATO raids and the publicity about all the property that Greg [Hales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6911s) buys up. I think it was, what, $70 million worth of property the Hales family's purchased just in Australia alone. Well, Shivano Consulting is Gareth Hales' business. And it looks like they've been buying property in New York and San Francisco. And I mean, you know, it doesn't it doesn't take a big leap of imagination to imagine that all this money, these millions and millions of dollars, billions of [dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6941s) that pour into the Hales family coffers. Rod Diplock is, you know, helping them out by investing it strategically in in high end poverty across North America.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6955s)

So I wanted to, I wanted to bring up a point that was said in there. Actually Rod Diplock said it. He said, if you've done something dodgy, it should flow clearly out of you if you want to be right. So as these ATO raids happen, I just want to remind you, Mick Strange, Rod Diplock, Bruce Hales, Gareth Hales, Dean Hales, Charles Hales, that if you've done something dodgy, it should just flow right out of you.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6981s)

That would, that would be an amazon of outflowing, wouldn't it, for that long?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=6986s)

And I mean, the way that they they talk about how they keep on telling them, oh, you know, you don't understand the criminal system, Mick says that. And which is they clearly do not understand the criminal system because you know, I, I'm actually going to use this for our own advantage. They definitely believe in guilty until proven innocent. So for every sexual abuse survivor in there and out here, those people are guilty until proven innocent. So I would like a phone call from [someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7016s) from Maple Creek and I would like to sit down with Alan Drever because he's guilty until proven innocent. It's completely shown in this, this audio how someone can be thrown in jail and questions are asked later.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7030s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7031s)

It is through the bars. They've gotten this over and over. They've said it quite a few times in here, how this teenager would have been thrown in jail and questions would have been asked later. So I think all of us, we've had 109 podcasts of people coming forward of abuse that I think that this same template should be laid down on all the stuff that we've come forward with. And not just with us that have left, but also those of you inside there. So if you're having a priestly visit and you're bringing up your sexual abuse, make sure that you remind them of this audio [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7062s) remind them that no, you did say that that's how the criminal system works is that you're thrown in jail first and questions are asked later. So it's complete.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7070s)

Lies. And Strange knows perfectly well. I mean, I've been to the police complaining about people hacking my computer and the police say, you know, that's not a police matter. You know, you could try and sue them, but you know, it's nothing to do with us. You know, even if you've got all the evidence, the police are not going to do anything. And they're certainly not going to leave you sitting in prison while they investigate. So here's Mick Strange lying through his teeth and then getting all morally outraged. [You're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7101s) telling us lies. You're telling us lies. The guy is lying all the time. I mean, this is absolutely characteristic in the whole Hales administration is that they're all a bunch of liars. They lie constantly. They don't know how to do anything different.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7116s)

It was really mad. It was just so triggering. It was so triggering. It brought my 16 year old self came charging forward, hence a lot of the smart out, smart ass comments I'm making today that I'm, you know, very well warranted after listening to that. Could you imagine, one of the things that I sat there and I actually cried over was, could you imagine if they took this kind of care towards the people that came forward about those that have abused them sexually? Could you [imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7146s) if this kind of care was taken towards those that we have said, hey, like this is what happened to me?

### [**Priest**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7154s)

Yeah, but no, that doesn't happen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7157s)

Those are covered up. Those are put underneath the rug. Those are, you know, give that to God, leave it with the Lord. But yet they, there's this little tidbit of a sense that UBT could have been breached and they're like ready to kill and sacrifice this poor teenager, right? Yeah. It shows where they're, it shows where they they align themselves. Yeah. It is not with the children. It is not with the care and compassion they talk about. It is all about their money. It's all about their [pocketbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7187s) and it's all about their their clients and constituents of UBT.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7192s)

One thing I noticed that's very interesting is that is that the teenager says something about, he says, Mick, we all know how the Blackberries were, the brethren's phones, the Blackberries were set up to monitor the brethren's conversations. And Mick Strange doesn't deny it\! He says, oh no, I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about that. So it's true. He knows it's true. It's absolutely, it's absolutely shocking the shit that goes down in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7221s)

And I think the other thing, and this is I really want the therapist that's coming on next to talk about, is the way that they didn't allow him to think. He wasn't allowed to have thoughts. And they even said at the end, I can't remember if it was Randy or if it was Greg that he was at suspicions. Suspicions, suspicions are from the devil. I think it was like he was talking about his suspicions, like you're not, they're not from the Lord, right? And they really get after him for thinking thoughts that you know, the one that they did really get after him for was when they asked him about Bruce Hales and being being the elect vessel. And he's like, he used, he had doubts about that. And of course they jump on him and they talk about how he needs, he needs to hold those thoughts captive. You need to deal with those right away, right away. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7271s) could you imagine if someone went to a priest and said, so I'm going to relate this back to sexual abuse again.

If someone said, you know, Hey, this person is abusing me. This person did this to me. Could you imagine if they jumped on that same thing of like, look, we need to get a hold of Mr. Hales right now. This needs to be dealt with. We need to get a hold of the police. They were so apt to be getting ahold of the police very fast for all this stuff. but yet where are the police when we've had how many accounts and records [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7301s) sexual abuse take place? The police are not called. Like it's just.

It's I think I have to be more of a smart ass today, otherwise I'm just gonna cry because it's just heart-wrenching. It is so freaking heart-wrenching that they care more about their franchises. I mean, we even hear Greg say that about, you know, we've got to save our locality, we've got to save our franchise, than they do about the heart and care and compassion being shown towards these teenagers and kids.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7334s)

What you're saying is, if, say, a teenage girl had gone along to the priest and said, you know, this older brother sexually abused me, the priest would be, would say, no, we mustn't go to the police, we've got to cover all this up. And then they would be brainwashing the girl into thinking, well, this never really happened. You know, you've got to control your thoughts. You know, you mustn't think like that. That wasn't what he intended. But if it's a case of someone who has potentially [seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7366s) something they shouldn't have done about what UBT is doing, then, oh, we're getting on to the police. We're getting on to the authorities.

Is yeah, so they use, they use the brainwashing both ways. They use the brainwashing to try and terrorize someone to because they're petrified to protect the financial interest. But they'll equally use the brainwashing to cover up if one of those, you know, older male guys has screwed up. They'll brainwash the victim into believing that the, that it never happened and they've just got to cover it up and that you mustn't take or that they've talked to him and he's, he's come into the clear. Yeah, that's [it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7404s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7405s)

Yeah, right, like like that's, it's just, it's not the same. It's.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7408s)

Just we deal with this ourselves. We don't take this outside of the fellowship.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7412s)

Yeah. So again, I think I go back to what Richard was saying before is, is this the kind of environment you want your children raised in?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7421s)

And is Mick Strange the kind of person you want your son to be when he grows up? Yeah. No, he's the role model. He's he's the perfect poster boy, product of Bruce Hales's ministry.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7436s)

Like you just don't say what he said. Like he's, I just, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7441s)

I mean, it's childish. It's it's immature just to like resort to those kind of insults.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7447s)

Just at the very end where Greg tells, Greg tells the teenager to don't be shocking. He's like, don't try to be shocking. I'm like, are you kidding me? Can you go back to the very beginning of this priestly visit when Mick Strange is yelling at this guy that he's dumb? I'm like, and then you're, you're ending this with telling this guy not to be shocking when he's literally just trying to defend himself. I don't know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7473s)

I'm just, I'm I'm like impressed that the the young guy had the guts to stand up for this. I mean, he's got some, the guy's got some guts because if I'd been treated like this in my teens, I would have just been a wreck. I would have been a wreck. I'd probably have just kind of run from the room crying and I don't know what I would have done.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7494s)

I think it's really good to point out to those that are inside that the healing process starts when you get out. It doesn't happen in there. You have to get out. It does not start until you get out. And I want to read a, I actually contacted the person that had this priestly visit and I asked for his input since this. So he's left, it's made a life for himself. And so this is what he said. When I first escaped, I was consumed by anger towards the priest who intimidated and threatened me, an 18 year old, with jail. What angered me most was their lack of understanding about the very thing they were [accusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7534s) me of.

However, over time, that anger turned into pity. I had the rare opportunity to rebuild my entire identity and beliefs from the ground up, which has made me a better person today. I've been incredibly lucky to find success running my own business, to be in a loving relationship with my fiance, and to have an entirely new family who loves me unconditionally. To anyone still in there, I want you to know that there is hope. You have this, you have the [strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7565s) within you to break free of that mental prison they put you in and create a life filled with love, understanding, and personal growth. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. And it is worth it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7577s)

It is worth it. Think of yourself as a pioneer who's going ahead to make a safe landing place for them when eventually the whole thing collapses or when your family actually comes around and realizes just how horribly that they've been, they've been robbed and cheated by this system. Yeah. Someone's, there's got to be someone who breaks the cycle, who breaks the generational curse. Just have the courage to be that person.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7604s)

Yeah, stand up to them. Do not allow a priestly visit like you heard here happen to you. And if you are in one and this is happening, have the courage to stop it because that is not pastoral care.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7619s)

Yeah. You've got no obligation to listen to this kind of bullshit. They have no right to treat you like this. You've got no obligation to agree to a priestly visit. You can turn them away. You can shut the door on their face. You can turn them away and there's nothing they can do. And if they come back and harass you and beat on your door and try and get in, then you need to call the police, tell the police you are being harassed. Yeah. And the police will respond to that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7646s)

Yeah. And make sure you record. As you see, it made no difference in Mick and Rod's response. They didn't. They had no. They didn't care. They had. They did not care at all. So to those people who are inside getting priestly visits, record. To those people working for the PBCC, let them know you're recording. If you're being mistreated, record, record, record, record, record everything you can and let them know you're recording it. Don't hide it. Let them know you're recording it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7672s)

And if you're an employee of Allfasteners or an employee of ControlTek and you come across this video, share it with your co-workers so they know what the, what they're really working for and what your boss is really like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7690s)

Thank you so much everyone. Up next, we have someone that's going to weigh in about this recording and we will dive into how this affects us and what kind of therapies are available for religious trauma and PTSD, CPTSD that comes out of this. So stay tuned for that. Okay. Thanks Richard for joining.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7710s)

You're welcome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7712s)

We are back now with a very special guest. This is Shanelle. Shanelle is very well versed with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Shanelle very much understands what each and every one of us has gone through on a therapist point of view and has an incredibly long list of credentials that make her input on this recording very valuable. She has a Bachelor's of Arts in Psychology. She just completed her Master of Counseling in Counseling Psychology. She will be a registered provincial [psychologist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7742s) soon. She has worked with people with complex mental health diagnosis in a residential setting for roughly seven years. She's worked in schools facilitating mental health and suicide awareness presentations. She's had experience doing crisis calls. She has volunteered for the sexual assault helpline.

She's worked in program development with topics related to domestic violence, mental health wellness, healthy relationships, boundaries, etc. She conceptualized and wrote the content for a website called the Kids Health Hub. [She's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7772s) worked on the domestic abuse response team and going to the hospital for those in an emergency that were experiencing domestic violence at home. She ran a meditation group in a secondary housing for domestic violence victims. She has supported children and youth and their families and the support people while coming to provide a police statement. She has worked with people who have experienced abuse and trauma to help them process their experiences through TIR, which is known as Trauma Incident Reduction. So welcome, Shanelle. [Thank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7803s) you for joining us. Thank you for having me. So the million dollar question all us ex-members have is, what were your thoughts listening to that audio?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7815s)

I have to say it was very difficult to listen to. It…the first 18 minutes after that, I was like, I could see how someone would give false confessions to things just to make it stop because it, it was endless. It was relentless what they were doing to him and they, they wouldn't let him talk. They kept cutting him off and I could see how it was really elevating him and which was by design for what [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7845s) were doing and trying to achieve. But it was really, really difficult to listen to because you could hear lots of different type of abuse and tactics to control him and make him compliant to what they were wanting essentially.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7861s)

Yeah, I agree. What long-term effects would you expect an interview like this to have on the victim?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7871s)

This is all very individual based and what I would guess, so it could be different for different people. But I would see that this could impact attachment or relationships in the future. It would make it really hard to form healthy attachments with people and know what healthy attachments look like. This was a form of coercive control or they're very coercive throughout this entire thing. And that really impacts relationships and the abilities to build relationships even [after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7901s) someone's out of that situation. So it can radiate throughout that because of the prevalence of abuse, I'm going to assume that this is not just an isolated incident for this individual.

And so that can lead to things like PTSD or complex PTSD, depression, anxiety, substance use and abuse. It also can lead to them really struggling to build and foster relationships with other people and feeling secure within [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7931s) or trusting themselves or affecting their identity and their self-worth and their self-efficacy and just their general relationship with themselves and others.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7943s)

Yeah. It was so hard for me to listen to that audio because that's all of my priestly visits were like that, right? And I still, still struggle with authority and authority from men. Like it's the patriarchal system that just gets me. And people who have gone through priestly visits like that spot that type of control a mile away. Like it gets me against the wall and I'll fight back, right? Because I, you, you can sniff it a mile away when someone is [trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7973s) to be controlling, trying to assert their dominance and that patriarchal authority on someone's entire being.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=7983s)

Yeah. Absolutely. And I could see why I even had that reaction listening to that because it was a very male-dominated patriarchal type of situation or abuse that was happening. And in that, when people experience things like that, especially repeatedly and in childhood, they become hyper vigilant because of different parts of the brain that are impacted. So they become hyper vigilant and more aware of threats in their environment. So [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8013s) who've experienced that will be more attuned to noticing those things because their brain is tuned  to scan for threats constantly. And it also really impacts that fight or flight response.

So that means that people who experience things like that, they might notice like subtle shifts that other people don't notice. Like if someone's, there's a subtle flash across someone's face, they'll be like, oh, that person is mad. And maybe they're just like thinking about, whoa, I need to get groceries or something. But to them, they'll notice that and because of the experiences that they'll have, [they'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8043s) attribute that to something bad, something threatening because that's what it's been. It's been threatening. It's been to harm them and control them essentially.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8054s)

Yeah. What would you say was the most damaging aspect of that priestly visit?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8060s)

The whole thing. I, it's hard to pinpoint it, to be honest. I think it was, there's a lot of compounding factors in there. There's one being called stupid repeatedly and breaking him down so he has to be like, yeah, I am stupid. And the only way to get beyond that is to say that he's stupid. And it's hard not to believe that when there's these higher authority people saying that you're stupid. And so that really impacts self-worth, like how he sees himself. And so I think that [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8090s) and as I was saying, it reminded me of, there's this thing, it's called attack therapy. I'm using therapy in quotation marks because it's not real therapy. It was developed by someone who thought AA wasn't strong enough for people with addictions.

And it was for helping people, helping people with addictions overcome them. And in that, they would get the therapist and group members to attack the person, to break them down so they could build them back up to what they wanted. So they would sit around the circle and say, you're stupid, you're stupid, you're stupid. Similar to what they were doing to him in that video, they're trying to break them down so they can build them up in the image that they would like, which is compliant. And so that is a piece within [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8135s) coercion and control and tactics to make it he is complying to a robot essentially to what they want.

Another piece of it when I was listening to it was in the first part, it was very threatening. Like you, you could hear him become elevated and his fight or flight response would have kicked in. And then after the first two guys got off the phone and he was just sitting there with his dad and the other two, he said he was shaking. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8166s) that would have been his the adrenaline and cortisol working through his system. When we go through a fight or flight response spike and down, we need to complete it by going into a safe environment or fighting the thing off or fleeing whatever it was. He couldn't fight. They were cutting him off. He wasn't able to defend himself and, or even say what happened without being called defensive.

He wasn't able to flee. Like he couldn't leave and he had to deal with this situation. So he was [coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8196s) down and another way, like when you can't fight or flight those things, run away from those things, you need to come down in a safe space to know, okay, I completed that cycle. I completed that loop. And for him to come down into the safe space, and that safe space wasn't safe. That place was, they were calling him, there's, his dad told him there's a satanic part in him, and that there's something wrong with him. And so the safety aspect is these people telling him that there's something wrong with him, and that he's [bad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8226s)

He, there's like evilness about him and so that it just really indoctrinates him into that belief system and it is, really falls in line with that brainwashing steps of Stephen Hassan. So it's really hard to pinpoint what is the most damaging. He was all, a lot of it was really attacking to his self-worth and just his ability to be a free thinker because when people experience abuse, [uh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8256s) there's this thing that when you work with people who've experienced abuse called honoring the resistance. And so when you're abused or you experience violence, systemic violence within a relationship or within this cult, people will start to resist to assert their power or gain their power back in some capacity.

They might start doing subtle things to test that power. And so so they'll do things to like test it to be like, okay, I am [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8286s) my own person. I can do these things and to regain that power back. And so that's something that was popping into my mind is that honoring that resistance of he was trying to test it when he, I it felt like to me, I don't know if this is right or not, but when he was sending the message initially that he was testing it and testing and that that was a part of his resistance, which is like, if you were to work with someone like that, you're like, yeah, you're trying to regain your power because they took [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8316s) away from you. And that's completely understandable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8320s)

And it sounded like in there that he had had these doubts for a while, right? Like he had been questioning things that he'd been questioning Bruce Hales. So yeah, that really, I never looked at it like that. That's very interesting. And I agree with you. It like it's, I don't want all of this onus just to stay on Mick and Rod, Mick Strange and Rod Diplock, that the onus is still also on the father and those other two priests, right? They might not have seemed as horrible as Mick and Rod, but they still had a, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8350s) I said this in the in earlier with when I was recording the podcast with Richard, is that they still had a due diligence. They still could have stopped that at the very beginning. But because of their hierarchy, because they weren't above or in the same level as Rod and Mick, they couldn't stop it.

But he did again, he didn't have that safety still even after they were done with him. You know, like it was still all going there. It's like, hit the deck, you know, fall to your knees. If they wanted him in that [submissive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8381s) response, right? To the point where when he was like, well, why were they like, why pretty much was, why were they able to say what they were able to say? And yet they're like, oh, leave that with the Lord. That's not your issue. Meanwhile, yes, it is your issue. It's this guy was just completely beat up for them and now you're telling them it's not his issue. Like the manipulation and the brainwashing that happened to that poor guy even after he was being beat up by Mick and Rod.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8407s)

Absolutely. And I saw that when Mick and Rod were talking at him and berating him and just, it was horrible to listen to, but I heard his dad's voice to say, oh, this is provoking to keep doing this. And so it puts that seed in there that, oh, he's on my side. These people are on my side. So it creates this false sense of safety that these other three, the dad and the two other [priests,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8437s) they were there because they cared and they were standing up for him, but then they used it to continue the narrative of the cult and of what is expected of him. I think it was by design, whether it's like an internalized response that comes with how to react and act within the cult, but it's it was a very, very impactful tactic for them to do that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8465s)

Yeah, I agree. So we talked a little bit about the abuse that happened. What kind of abuse behavior would you identify in an interview like this?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8478s)

Well, I was looking through some of my content for violence and different types of abuse. And within this one course that I conceptualized, I think there's 10 types of abuse. And I found within that there's probably one, two, three, four, five types of abuse within that section. And you could tell it's cut off, so who knows what happened afterwards. Yeah. So there was an abusive [identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8508s) or cultural abuse. So it's using the culture within the church to harm him and attack him as a person and basically tell him he's not good enough or he's not worthy unless he hits the deck, which honestly, for me listening to that, how many times they said the deck was making me very frustrated because when he said, what does that even mean? Because they're just talking nonsense that it's hard to know. It's so confusing.

There's also a psychological, emotional, mental, however you want to call that or [qualify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8538s) it. And within that category, there is inflicting emotional pain. There's insulting, degrading, threatening, invalidating, belittling, guilting, blaming the person, threatening harm to him. There was very heavy-handed threats from Mick. Threatening to call the police. Intimidating the person. And forcing him to do things that he doesn't want to do. It seemed like they wanted him to admit to things that he didn't actually do. Like that was, it really seemed like they were pushing that narrative.

They're withholding like affection from him as well because it was like, if you do this, it's conditional. And it was minimizing what happened. They really minimized. Yeah, like that's their job. Of course they're gonna do that. And it's like, no, that's that's not okay. And within that, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8594s) also social abuse. So they even referenced it with the isolation. And isolation is is abusive. And they monitor social interactions. So they're monitoring, monitoring his social interactions with that his co-worker or whoever that other person was. And preventing him from seeing others. Like they're like, don't see the other worldly people. You can't talk to them. That is isolation. It's a very [common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8624s) tactic within cults as well.

And also withholding that information from them to like, oh no, you can't access other information from the world because it's satanic or however they want to qualify. And also spiritual or religious abuse. So they used values and beliefs and religion to justify their actions.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8652s)

Yeah, and that happened over and over and over.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8654s)

Yeah. It really did. And it was, that was the theme that you could hear through was really using religion and salvation and hell to get him to do what they wanted essentially and forcing him into a practice. Like you have to do this. This is what you have to do by 8 a.m.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8675s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8676s)

Yep. And it was late when they were doing this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8680s)

It was after midnight when finally those priests left and they wanted him to still stay up and do this. Yeah, talk about that tactic.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8687s)

And that's also a part of the coercion as well. And that's a really big part of being a part of like within cults is to control someone's behavior and manipulate the environment as well. And so that could go into not allowing them to sleep. And that's the part of the steps of brainwashing or mind control by Stephen Hassan. And they were in that part is called unfreezing. So that's breaking the person down. That's just completely breaking them down, not letting them sleep. That was very apparent throughout that whole thing. Honestly, the three steps, you can see that.

Changing, they have that indoctrination of like, this is what you have to do. This is what we do here. And they kept saying like, I did this in 1985, or whatever dates they were using and all of that. And then there was the rephrasing. They're trying to build him up in the an artificial version of himself to fit within their confines of what it means to be good. Yeah. And additionally, there was a lot of verbal abuses. The verbal abuse was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8758s)

Horrendous. And that's what they consider pastoral care. Like that is their pastoral care.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8764s)

Which is astounding. Like it's really just astounding to me that I struggle with words for that because it's just, it was horrific to listen to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8774s)

And it's considered normal. Like that's literally considered normal in there.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8777s)

And that's how people maintain power and control. And so within the verbal abuse, there was being condescending, there was elevated voices or yelling, there was name calling, there was insulting, there was ridiculing, there was acting sarcastic or passive aggressive, using words to manipulate him and shift things. And it was threatening him or using words to threaten him. And it was basically using words to be mean, cruel, and hurtful. And so all of these [tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8808s) were to maintain power and control. That is the basis of any abusive relationship is to maintain power and control. And that would be the same as cults is they need to have that power and control. They he needed to hit the deck. He needs to be submissive. He needed to do whatever it was so they could still maintain that power because they're above him in some capacity based on like how they were speaking to him. It was to maintain their power over him. And when he said he is a thinker, like he likes to think and question things and again, don't do that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8848s)

Yeah. That was hard. Like after you've left it but up for 30 years, right? And so when you start to learn how to think for yourself and like coming back and listening to that, you're like, you forget, you forget how they, yeah, you're not allowed to think in there. And that, but to see it on display, the way that they displayed it, you're not allowed to have those kinds of thoughts. I don't remember all the words that they used, but yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8869s)

And that's to maintain power because if you start to think, then you'll question. Yeah. And so, and that's the same with accessing mental health care. They try to isolate people to perpetuate their power. It's the same with parents who are abusive, they'll tell their kids, don't tell anyone what happens at school. When you go to school, don't tell them what happens at home. You can't say those things. And that's to maintain power because they don't want that person to go out and say what's happening in there because [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8899s) wrong. It's not okay. And so they need to maintain and control that narrative. So they'll say like, don't talk to anyone else. Don't talk to worldly people. Don't access mental health care. This is a “you” problem.

And so that maintains that control. So when they're saying like, don't access mental health care, it's because of you, you're mental. That is just them one, making it so they have that power and control. It is making them that person [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8930s) more, what is the word I'm looking for? Like listen to them more because they start to not trust themselves. It's like a form of gaslighting. And so they won't trust themselves in their narrative and they don't want them to reach out for help because they actually don't want people to be well and start thinking for themselves because then it's harder to control them. And to have that idea of, oh, I can't access mental health care because I'm mental or it means that I'm mental. It's like, no, that's them maintaining control. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8961s) that's the indoctrination.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8961s)

Yeah, this is what I come up against right now with those that are still inside, recent leavers trying to access or trying to, I guess, convince them that therapy is what they need. Because when in there you get told, it's a very widely used term is that, you know, you're mental, you're mental. It is for generations and generations. That's been the label they've given them, right, is that you're mental. And so we have these recent leavers or people who are on their way [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=8992s) and you suggest therapy, well, that triggers them because right away they put into that category, well, I've been told I'm mental. Well, therapy is just confirming that I'm mental.

And it's hard for them to differentiate that it's two separate issues. I've said this on another podcast. I brought this up was that those are two separate issues. It is really two separate issues that I wish I could help them uncouple it, right? I mean, in therapy, that's what we call it, right? It's it's a coupling that happens and [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9022s) needs to be uncoupled so that they realize that this was the damage that was done to you. This is an antidote that can help you get over this.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9033s)

Absolutely. And they'll create that belief or thought system. Like that's what they've done for generations to maintain their power. So then they indoctrinate people with the idea that they can't access mental health care because it makes them lesser than or it makes them crazy, mental. And so that is an indoctrinated thought and that is a tricky and challenging thing to challenge the thoughts that have been in essence implanted in you from [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9063s) within that system for so long. And so that's their way of maintaining that control. It's their perspective or their way to get it so they don't have to be questioned ever because if people were to get help or talk to someone, their therapist would probably like, oh my gosh, like this is what you're going through. Like that's not okay. And if you went back to them like, hey, my therapist told me this isn't okay, that's not gonna go well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9091s)

Yeah, yeah. And that's why the therapy therapists that they do get are they, they choose them, right? The the cult chooses them for them, right? Looking back on that audio, did you, was there anything positive that you could see in that interview or in that priestly visit?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9109s)

I heard his strength. I heard he, I, I heard he was, he was very strong and the whole time. Like, I think it would be easy to really and completely understandable for people like, okay, yeah, I did it. I did the things that you're accusing me of, but he maintained, I didn't do the things you're accusing me of. I lied about it. Yeah, but I didn't do those things. Yeah. But he was very strong in his convictions and [that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9139s) And he demonstrated his critical thinking and that he's been questioning these things and he's been kind of testing the water so that resistance because he's wanting to learn more. And it really spoke to his values and who he was as a person.

And that he was able to just really like, I don't understand. And like, essentially, he called them out and be like, this doesn't make any sense. Like, what are you saying? And they would just talk in circle nonsense. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9169s) I really heard his strengths and that is so good. Yeah. That is really true. Like to be there and be 19, he wasn't that, like that's remarkable. Yeah. And for him to have that critical thinking and to be wondering those things and to really navigate that and just hold strong in himself. That's what I really heard throughout is like, he was strong and he did what he had to do to get through that. Like he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9200s) calling him out like that wasn't okay and then they would just talk over him. But he was very intelligent as well. Like critical thinking and really questioning those things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9210s)

Yeah, yeah. Like in your opinion and in everything that you've, you've helped a lot of people, like how does someone get over, how do, how do we get over these types of priestly visits? And like, I know it's a million dollar question, but like for myself personally, I get so triggered by these men trying to control a conversation or not letting you speak your truth. You know, the men that are in there and even come out of there really hold these programs in them [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9240s) they don't see it. So like, how do we, how do you navigate it or how do you, how did these, again, another question I could say is, how do these men find a way to move past this very abusive training? And I'm gonna say, I'm not saying that all men that come out or all men in there are like this, but it is a huge issue. And like, I've had these issues even just recently in my own personal life and it takes me forever to get through the trigger. Like what in your expertise, like how do we, how do we move through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9271s) type of abuse that so many have suffered from?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9275s)

This is dependent based on the type of model or therapy that you conceptualize this with, which is a rather non-specific answer. So I'm sorry. So I'll talk to you through a couple of things. One thing that you can do is start practicing curiosity. And so noticing your triggers of like when that comes up, like, oh, this is what's triggering me or this is what's happening in my body. And [sitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9305s) with that curiosity and not judging. Like, okay, yeah, this is what's happening for me. And really taking notice. That's one of the first steps is like noticing those triggers and what happens so then you can really start to be like, okay, let's start to unpack these things.

Based on the therapeutic model, there's different ways to approach this. If you look at it from TIR or traumatic incident reduction, they would say get to the root of it and so process it and process [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9335s) concept of priestly visits, go through incidences and get to the core incident and process it until there's no feelings left because what happens when we experienced trauma, because that's what this was, it was trauma, it creates something like an activity loop that was open. So we were gonna, he was probably gonna go about his night, go to bed and be done with, like that was his day, but his activity loop was interrupted by this priestly visit. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9365s) so he wasn't able to like close that thing off because there's this trauma that happened. And so that remains open within his body.

And we hold trauma and emotions within our body. So right now, unless he's processed these things, that is open within him. So unless you process like that first priestly visit, that's still going to be active and open within your body. And you're going to feel that within your body. So from the traumatic incident reduction framework, it's really working through and processing those things [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9396s) getting to the root of it, which really speaks to like psychodynamic types of therapy. If you look at, in something like internal family systems, they would work with the parts because there's different parts of us. And so from that model, there are parts who manage things and they take over so you don't have to feel those really heavy emotions. They manage those things.

They actually adopt similar ways [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9426s) which you experience emotional emotions as a child. So if your parents or people around you like, no, we don't cry, we shove that away or we do these things, you can adopt those. There are a lot of times the parts will adopt those behaviors and turn that inward. So it's really working with those protectors and letting them know, okay, yeah, it is scary to feel those things, but let's feel those things and unburden that other part that has those heavy, that heaviness. So it depends on what works for the person and what they're interested in. [Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9456s) that really works well for trauma is also cognitive behavioral therapy.

And really looking at those thoughts and distortions in those thoughts as well. And practicing that curiosity again of like, okay, I'm having this thought come up. This isn't like, this is a distorted thought. This isn't, is a cognitive distortion and really looking at those that thought triangle, like here's my thoughts and beliefs and actions and looking through there. And also practicing [curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9491s) in the sense of listening to others. So the men who've been indoctrinated into these things and want to change, listening, listening is so important to be like, hey, people don't want to be treated like this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9506s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9506s)

That's, yeah. So how can people want to be treated? How do I want to be treated? And how do I want to treat myself and using compassion to really understand like you went through trauma. This is really hard. It's going to take time. It's going to really take that time to process those things. There's lots of different therapies that have been applied to trauma and have been helpful. Like DBT as well has been helpful, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9536s) is dialectical behavioral therapy. So it depends on the person's interest as well. And understanding a book that's really popular right now is called The Body Keeps The Score. And it talks about how we store trauma in our brain. So we often, we can talk through trauma, but there is limitations with that. In an article by Duros and Crowley, it's a peer-reviewed article, they talk about how talk therapy is limited and you can't process all of trauma through talk therapy and it has to come with a mind body approach. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9575s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9576s)

They really propose that you should integrate body practices within therapy as well to help the person process the trauma that's stored in the body. Yeah, because trauma comes with unfulfilled actions or reactions. So for maybe that person, he wanted to run out of the room, but he couldn't. And so that action is still stored within his body.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9599s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9600s)

And it's still going to be active in essence within his body because he couldn't complete that action.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9606s)

Yeah, yeah. I know my therapy changed my, it changed my life when I introduced somatic experience into my therapy, right? Like it is, it was just a whole different level of healing. It really allowed me to get into the the trauma stored in my body from all the sexual abuse for so long, right? It really, really does make a difference. And like I always tell, I've had tons of people reach out to me in the last couple months of like, sure, what kind of therapy do you do? What therapy is out there? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9636s) so I always tell people like, try it on like clothing, right? Like there's EMDR, there's TIR, there's somatic experience, there's things called TRE, it's trauma reduction exercises. There's just so many things out there that I always tell people when you're looking for a therapist, look for someone beyond just talk therapy. Look for someone who's got a modality and something else that helps unlock the trauma that's in the body.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9662s)

Absolutely. And there's so many different modalities to use. It's about finding one that works for you or connects with you because EMDR and ART, they're very similar, but they're not 100% the same. Like what is better for you kind of thing. It's also understanding that this is a natural reaction to a crazy situation. This is a natural reaction to an environment that was not okay. And so to be [compassionate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9693s) and kind with yourself within internal family systems, they say that even some health issues are protector parts or parts trying to protect that person or trying to have their feelings or their story to listen to. So if you, someone has like back pain, it might not just be that they pull the muscle, it might be that they have a part in there or trauma stored in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9719s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9720s)

And so that's why I think it's really important to tie in body work of some variety, whatever that modality is that fits for them. For some people, cognitive behavioral therapy is like, that works great for them and that's all talking and that's wonderful. But for other people to really help resolve, they need that melding of mind and body.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9740s)

Yeah, I agree. I agree. I have not worked through my the priestly visit triggers I get like I don't, I've had like an incident just recently that I was saying before that just threw me into like such trigger mode, such trigger mode. And it's, it's hard, but I guess for myself, the curiosity thing has always been at the forefront for me. It's always being curious of like, because it's so easy to judge ourselves, right? It's so easy to pounce on [ourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9770s) and be like, no, it's been 30 years that you've been out. But to me, I do look at those experiences as a magnet that bring deep trauma to the surface, right? And I know I'm in a deep, deep pocket of healing right now.

So it seems like everything's a trigger to me right now, but it is. If you can stay curious about yourself and being like, okay, this isn't necessarily about this person that may have did it to me. It's more about what is coming up in you. What is that's coming up in me? That still means I can place a boundary. And I did [place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9801s) a boundary, right? Those boundaries get laid, but at the same time, it is going back within the self and being like, okay, like what did this experience just dig up inside you? And sometimes it can be massive, right? It's huge and it takes you weeks to unravel it, which is where I'm at. It's taken me weeks to unravel this trigger, but I still again say therapy is so, so, so important for anyone coming out of a cult like the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9828s)

Absolutely. To do that by yourself is insurmountable. Yeah. Even if you have mental health training or have been a part of that, like that would be very difficult. There's a reason that therapy exists. It's because we can't get through everything alone and it's okay to ask for help and it's okay not to be okay. And there's people there to help and people there to listen. And therapy [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9859s) one of those things, like it does come with a stigma, especially from for people within the church because they've been told that it's not good. But again, that's their way to control and it's about choosing you and choosing yourself. Like, you know what, I deserve to feel okay. I deserve to be happy because 100% people deserve to feel okay and good within their own bodies and secure.

And so making choices to help them get to that [point,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9889s) like therapy or whatever that practice is for them. And within the church, choosing themselves was never an option. No, really.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9900s)

No, no.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9901s)

And that's super important. It's just like when you go on an airplane, they say, put your mask on first before you put your kids' masks on. And when you regard it in therapy, like take care of you and then you can help other people. And so you can be an effective leader or be helpful, be kind to others as well. Because within the church, you live for others, the upper people typically, but like if you want to look at it that way, you can turn that attention, okay, I need to [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9931s) me first so I can be helpful, kind or whatever it's going to be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9935s)

Yeah. Yeah, it sure makes a difference. Earlier Richard had talked about his recipe that they used here. What, what are your thoughts on what Richard's recipe was all about?

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9951s)

Yeah, they did that. They they really did those things because it really led with, do you want to fight? And it was so listening to that, but I was just, these guys need better listening skills because like, you're not being direct with us. He said literally, no, I didn't. But they just kept hearing, we will fight you. Do you understand? He's like, yeah, I understand. We will fight you. Do you understand? So yeah, that was very apparent. And they were really insulting and they, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=9981s) he was calling him stupid, stupid idiot, you know nothing, you're not smart, which I found very ironic actually, because they seem very illiterate about technology, but they were calling him a stupid idiot and that he didn't know anything, but they were revealing their own blind spots within their knowledge and like knowledge gaps and calling him the stupid one. Yeah, like, well, that's very ironic because.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10007s)

And then telling them that they didn't, he didn't know about, he didn't know about the criminal system and clearly they did not know about the criminal system either.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10015s)

Well, that part of me, I was just like, just tell them to go the cops. They'll see that they did nothing. Like you did nothing wrong. And I, that's one thing I was, I've read is that within cults, they can believe two things at once. Like lying is wrong, but we'll lie to get our way. Yeah. And we'll lie to get people in. And that was very apparent within that. There was a very dichotomous thing that was happening within that. They did bring his parents into it and he said, don't [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10046s) put this on my dad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10047s)

Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10047s)

He is very protective of his dad, which you could see that that love between him and his dad. And then later his dad told him there was something satanic within him. So it's really hard. And again, that goes back to the relationships that would be so hard, especially if he grew up within the cult. Yeah. It was, there is research to show that second and subsequent generation people who grew up in cults, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10077s) actually harder on them for their identity formation because they don't know their identity outside of the cult, whereas people who came into it, they have their identity to go back to. So it is really hard and it's really, it's really challenging to navigate to know those things because they haven't been able to explore who they really want because it goes back to that indoctrination. And the final step of dangle over, yeah, there is hell. They're like, do you want to go to hell?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10107s)

Yeah. And they even did at the very end with, you know, the two local priests made sure that they reiterated and wrapped it up with that.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10114s)

Yeah, it was very much like the good cop, bad cop, because they, Mick and Rod were definitely the bad cops. And then the other is that and the other two priests were just like, oh, come on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10127s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10128s)

And it was very confusing. I think this is also by design of how many people would talk at once because it was very overwhelming.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10137s)

Isn't it incredible? Like there was a whole chunk there where all four people were all talking at the same time and nobody stopped, whether it was two separate conversations going on, but I was just like, I couldn't, I thought it was an audio issue until I went back to the original audio and I'm like, no, this isn't an audio issue. This literally is everybody talking at the same time.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10158s)

Absolutely. Very overwhelming tactic of theirs. Like that's a really, that's a sensory overload and just to be like, hey, enough, enough, stop. Like I'll do what you want. Like you could tell that's what they wanted was him to just fold and do exactly what they wanted him to do, which was confusing to me because he said he would write it down in like the first like 10 minutes. Yeah, I'll write it all down. And then they were just like, just write it down. He's like, I've already said I would. And they're like, well, ask for help. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10188s) he's like, and then he asked for help, they're like, oh, just hit the deck.

It was like talking nonsense. They're just talking in circles to be confusing. And a lot of times within abuse, people change the narrative to make someone feel like they're on uneven ground so they don't know what's happening. So then you have to trust them to tell you what's happening because that it creates that uncertainty in your mind of like, I don't know what's going on. So then you have to reach out to someone like that to be like, okay, what's going on? Then they can tell you what's going on. Then you have their version [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10224s) reality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10224s)

Yeah. And they really, you could, you really felt them doing that with the same thing with them telling them that they loved each other, right? That, you know, I love you, I love you, man. And I, I'd actually forgotten about that that I remember that in our priestly visits, right? Where they're, and I talked about this previously when with Richard is that their conception of love is so distorted. It is so distorted, but it is the words that you hang on to while you're in there. But while they say they love me, so they must love me, right? But your [concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10255s) and your, the ability to understand really what love is, you don't have inside your body because you've never had it, right?

Like I had never experienced it in there until I had left. And then you're like, wow, like you just get overwhelmed by the, this is what actual caring feels like. This is what it feels like to have someone care for me. It's completely different than what it's in there, including their own parents, right? And you see that in there with his dad, right? At the end, his dad was on his ass. Like [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10285s) dad had chosen the priest's side. And that's what happens is they separate that familial bond that the parents are separated and they have to choose the side of the priest and go against their own side, their own, their own kids in order to be able to keep the peace and safety.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10303s)

It's not really, it really goes against our evolutionary ideals and like just how our brain has evolved to really take care of our, our people, like our family and to have that bond. It's really going against that natural instinct to protect your child. And that's at the sake of a sense of belonging within this church because if you don't belong within them, they're going to outcast you and then you [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10333s) nothing. Yeah. And that idea of love, I agree with you, like it's, it's very skewed. It's a very skewed definition of love and it's very conditional. And when you have conditional love, people will adapt traits that they think will get them that love, whether it's perfectionism, whether it's subservience, whatever has given them love, that's what they're going to do.

And that person who is giving the love, love, they'll keep that person uncertain so [they'll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10363s) keep striving harder. They'll show them glimmers of love so they keep coming and keep trying to please, keep trying to do those things. So that's another tactic of getting people to do what they want is that very, very conditional version of love, very conditional and skewed version.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10380s)

That's yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10380s)

It's, it would be really hard for attachment and like relationship building and even to love oneself. It's a very, very shame based and shame led life. It's very toxic shame. There's this counselor, his name is Bradshaw. I think it's John Bradshaw. He talks about toxic shame. And it is very shameful. And he believes that shame is the root of all addictions and things like that. And so they [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10411s) perpetuate shame to help you, help to get the version of you they want. Yeah. Subservient and questioning. Yeah. When you lead a shame-based life, you don't know how to love yourself because your parents didn't know how to love themselves and they couldn't teach you. And they are actively trying to tear you down. And so that inherent right to love yourself is taken away.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10438s)

So toxic. It's just like my heart is just shredding right now because it's just, there's so many things that I know I'll be healing for the rest of my life, but it makes me so sad for the families that get split up over this, right? Like it's, it's one thing to sit here and talk about it, it's another thing to live with it. And again, I'm just going to reiterate this that it is so, so important to try out therapies. Just [try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10468s) them out like you're going shopping for a new piece of clothing. It's a life force that you can't live without. It's lifeblood that we need in order to continue walking through this. Yeah.

### [**Shanelle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10480s)

Absolutely. And it helps people to identify the patterns and thought processes that were adapted for survival within there. Because we do the best we can with what we have and we try to survive. And so we have to adopt those things, like within those situations. So people have to adopt those thought patterns for safety in essence because when you start questioning it, you get things like these priestly visits, which are horrific, they're abusive, they're horrible. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10511s) I think it is really important to like identify like therapy is for everyone. It isn't, it doesn't confirm that you are mental or anything like that. It confirms that you were subjected to a really crazy set of circumstances that were unhealthy and toxic and therapy helps unwind it.

Yes, absolutely. And even for people who didn't experience like growing up in the cult or like something like that, [therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10541s) is great for them too. Like therapy, if you need help with anything like that, navigating relationships, learning new skills and helping to build that mental health that is so important. And I think it's really important to remember you are worthy of love, real love and to love yourself. And inherently you were born with that and they've taken that away from you when you're in the cult.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10563s)

Yeah, yeah. Wow, that's, we'll leave it on that. That is a beautiful statement to end this with. I really, really appreciate you Shanelle. We really appreciate you weighing in on this. I knew with all your religious trauma studies that you would be able to give a very thorough explanation about what was actually going on inside here. I really want to end this podcast with a song from Bruce [Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10594s) from Coventry, United Kingdom. And I just want everyone to really sit with these lyrics. He poured his heart and soul into this song. I have never had a song give me so much healing as listening to this song over the last couple days. Thank you so much Bruce.

I will put links to his social media of where this song is. I will add links to the articles that Shanelle has talked about, a link to the book, The Body Keeps the Score, links to Stephen [Hassan's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10625s) articles and his own website. And I just want to let everybody know that I will include a Dropbox link to just the audio of this priestly visit. And if you are in therapy for what you endured in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, you're welcome to take this link to your therapist and have them understand exactly what you endured in your priestly visits and dissect what parts of this priestly visit were similar to yours.

And it helps them understand what [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10655s) really went through versus them trying to grasp the concept of what it could be. I don't think a lot of therapists fully understand what we endured in our priestly visits until we have something like this that can give them an idea of what it is that we endured. So please look below for in the description of this podcast for a Dropbox link to just the audio of this that you can send to your therapist. And I will try and put as many of these into insider links that you may be able to download [without](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10685s) it showing up on any of your UBT devices. So thank you again Shanelle. We really, really appreciate it.

And thanks to everyone for supporting us through this chaotic time inside. We are here for you. We understand. I I feel you. We feel you. Oh, every day I wake up and that's all I think about is those of you that are really actively trying to leave. My suggestion for you to do is really make sure that you're looking into therapy to be one of the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10716s) foundations that you land on. It's needed. Until next time, everyone, much love to you all. Bye-bye.

### [**Bruce Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10736s)

Money and power ain't nothing without control.

 Complete submission is her only goal.

 A system set up on power, a power from above. 

They'll trick you into thinking that you're not good enough. 

Crimes unspeakable happening under the nose. 

They'll sweep it under the carpet. It's how it goes. 

So long as you still have money, a day can take a few. 

Gladly ignore the wicked deeds you do.

 And if you ain't got nothing, you got nothing left to lose.

 Still have your dignity, you can still choose. 

If you don't comply, they'll abandon you. 

No need to worry, it's just what they do. 

Now that I'm free, I've got nothing to lose.

 [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10841s) can just sit here, sing my freedom blues.

Now I'm free from the shackles and the chains.

 Eyes are open, free from the rain. 

I can walk, I'm almost running. High of my own mind. 

Make my own decisions. I'm free to decide.

 If you ain't got nothing, you got nothing left to lose. 

Still have your dignity, you can still choose.

 [If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aut0TdcfC4&t=10895s) you don't comply, they'll abandon you.

 No need to worry, it's just what they do. 

Now that I'm free, I've got nothing to lose.

 I can just sit here and sing my freedom.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
