### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=22s)

Happy Sunday, everybody. Sorry I've been a little MIA lately on the PBCC videos, but I'm back. I kind of just got a little off. I wasn't feeling it. You know, I don't know. But sometimes you get just that little oomph that kind of reinvigorates you. And aside from the fact that a number of you have been messaging me and things like that saying, hey, we want your videos again, which thank you, by the way. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=53s) do appreciate it, even if I ignored you for a while.

But right now, there is a five-part series that is happening. It's in the Fargo Forum, the Grand Forks Herald, the Jamestown Sun. Um so far just parts one and two have been published but this reported a really great job um on a piece about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church right in the area where I grew up like in Neche, Pembina, St. Vincent and it is really really in-depth and really good and it kind of just got me back in the mode again of hey [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=89s) time to start talking about this again it's not just going away.

And whether I talk about it or don't talk about it isn't going to change whether current brethren talk to me, look at me, wave at me, anything. So might as well keep talking about it. So anyways, I've been sharing a bit about this on my social media. If you have a subscription to any of those publications, you can read this article. If you don't have a subscription, I don't think it's super expensive, but I also get life is expensive, so I totally understand if you don't want to subscribe but I will keep trying to just share what I can on social media so you can pick it up on Facebook or something like that. [In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=129s) the meantime I'm going to start trying to get back on posting my videos a little more regularly but tell me what you want to hear because I think I have ideas about what to talk about and then I'm like yeah that's dumb and then I just don't post anything at all so input would be great. Message me, comment, something, tell me what you want to know.

I'll tell you what I know. I mean, as long as it's Plymouth Brethren related, I don't know anything about anything else.

Anyway, have a wonderful day. Enjoy not being in church all day like the Brethren are. Bye.

Good morning, friends. So I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and reached out. Thank you for your kind words and ideas. I've jotted them down, keeping track of them so I will get to them, I promise. But for today, for my PBCC topic, since the news stories are so out there right now, I decided to talk a little bit about how the Brethren feel about public [opinion,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=199s) publicity, I don't know what the word is. But anyways, the Brethren are really, really secretive to the point that like when I was young, it was very much like, yes, people will want to ask questions and will want to know about us, but they don't understand. So it's just best to not engage. It's best to not answer. And they very much believe that people that left the Brethren and spoke about the Brethren were extremely bad. Those were the really, really bad people, like going to the next [level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=234s) of hell.

So along these lines, I even, when I left the Brethren in the letter that I left my family, I had said, like, I'm leaving because I don't agree with the Brethren anymore. I don't believe in a lot of the practices that you're subscribing to. Um but like I still want a relationship with you, I still want a connection with you and like don't worry I won't say anything bad about the Brethren because at that point like I was [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=267s) so brainwashed that I couldn't really imagine a time where I would feel brave enough to speak out about the Brethren.

Obviously I've kind of gotten past that point, but that was genuinely how I felt.

And I think at this point I'm probably considered an apostate by the Brethren. That's the level that they label those of us that speak against them. But my family wasn't talking to or having anything to do with me anyways. It wasn't like I blew up a relationship with them to talk about it. And I figure at this point if just one thing I say resonates with someone that's [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=320s) stuck inside to the point that they start questioning things and possibly leave, then it's a hundred percent worth it.

Because the reality is it's all true. I wish it wasn't, but it is.

And along with that, with all these news stories that are out there right now, I can guarantee that within the Brethren, I can literally hear what is being said, you know, that the quote-unquote position is under attack, that the Brethren are facing extreme persecution and I'm sure they're even tying this to Revelation saying that like at the end times true believers will face extreme trials and that's what they're facing right now.

That's how they roll. So I just want to kind of I just wanted to explain that a little bit that to them like these news stories that are out right now the podcasts the publicity they're getting they're not liking this at all they want to push their RRT charity that's what they want publicity for but that's really not the whole story and I think everybody deserves to see the whole story. Um also one final note I just [wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=398s) to touch on in part three of the news story that just came out today. It referenced my young daughter and I am not aware that I have a young daughter so I just wanted to clarify that I do not have any children.

Perhaps the reporter was referring to my cat?

Probably. Anyway, just wanted to clear that up a little bit.

Hey everybody\! Almost forgot to do my video today so I thought I better do it really quick. So for my PBCC topic today, I don't know if this is really a PBCC thing. I mean it's kind of associated so I'll throw it in there but I just wanted to touch on I've had some people over the years when I'm talking about things related to the PBCC say to me when are you going to move on like you're not in there anymore it's time to let it go and move on [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=455s) I just wanted to kind of talk about that a little bit because truthfully I think I have moved on. I am married, I have a family,friends, a good job, a good circle, and I live a good life. But with that said, I can't pretend that the first 21 years of my life didn't happen because I tried that for the first 10 years after I left and the crash that followed and lots of therapy tells me that that's not maybe the way to handle it. So I am going to keep talking about it because the reality is too [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=496s) all of my family is still in there. With the exception of one aunt and one uncle, all of my family is still trapped in this cult, still brainwashed. And so I will not stop talking about this because I want to be very clear that as long as I'm talking, there is hope that someone is going to hear what I have to say. [Someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=527s) within that group is going to hear what I have to say, going to think about what I'm saying, and it's going to grow. And they're going to say, hey, I can have a life too. I can be free. I can think for myself.

So I don't really know that there's a moving on button. There's a moving forward button where you actually live a life. But moving on,

I don't really know. I don't really know what that looks like. And I don't know if I'll ever know what it looks like and and I think that's okay and I also think if you figured out how to move on from a huge chunk of your life that still has your family removed from you then I'm really happy for you truly but I haven't so I'm sorry I'm gonna keep talking about it I'm gonna keep talking about the Brethren and I'm gonna keep talking about their [issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=589s) and if you don't like it, that's 100% you're right. You don't have to watch these videos. You don't have to listen to me talk. I mean, I talk a lot, so that's going to be a challenge, but I just want to put that out there. So anyway, that's all I got for you today. I'll be better tomorrow. Maybe. Hopefully.

Good morning. For today's PBCC fact of the day, I'm going to talk about alcohol and the Brethren. So as I'm sure you're aware, the Brethren love their alcohol. It starts at a very young age. I was first offered alcohol in front of my parents, just very normal, when I was 13\. And by the time I was 17, 18, I was drinking alcohol every day to the point where I was [working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=639s) at that time. So I'd give my mom money and she bought me my very own bottle of port wine and blackberry brandy to make sure that I could have a mixed drink of those two every single night and I did for probably about well up until I left at age 21 I had at least one eight-ounce glass of blackberry brandy and port wine mixed every night on the weekends when you go out to someone's house for supper on a Sunday night it was very normal to be offered [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=669s) drink and my drink of choice was Canadian and Diet Coke and no problem to have two or three of those at age 17 or 18\.

So, um, yeah, I didn't really even realize that was weird until after I left the Brethren. That's how common it is. Um, and it's not healthy at all. Shocker. There have been a lot of issues with people dying from alcohol-related diseases. And then, of course, there's the vehicular accidents.

Tragic accidents relating to Brethren and their drinking. There's just one that happened a few months ago in Ohio. A 26-year-old Brethren man actually used to live in this area. I babysat him and his twin sister a lot when they were little.

And he was drinking, well I shouldn't say he was drinking, his blood alcohol limit was over the legal level and he got in an accident and he killed four people. And I wish I could say that was an isolated incident but it's not.

Alcohol is a huge issue and it's something they should be taking far more seriously but you know they would rather focus on calling out those of us that are telling the world their problems and telling you all how awful we are that's something to worry about a little more than a 16 year old with the drinking problem right anyway I think it's a two-sided issue I think part of it is people drink [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=778s) forget about their problems to pretend like everything's fine and it's not but they also drink because it is a peer pressure thing the Brethren are some of the most keeping up with the Joneses kind of people that you will ever know if one person does it the next person has to and alcohol was a very peer pressure thing you didn't drink you're a weirdo what's wrong with you if you didn't drink a lot [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=808s) a weirdo.

So yeah, not real great situation in my opinion.

One weird thing, and I don't know if this has changed, but at least when I was still in, clear alcohol was frowned upon. You were not supposed to have vodka, gin, or clear rum in your house. I think they can now. I mean, it's probably another corner the Lord turned, you know how those go? But it was like, when I was growing up, it was like you know wine and brandy canadian whiskey bourbon scotch oh gotta have the Johnny Walker on hand [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=847s) yeah very weird anyway there you go a little bit about alcohol good morning friends so today for my PBCC fact of the day i am going to talk about the white envelopes and if some of you are going what are we talking about with white envelopes there's recently been a series of articles in some newspapers and there was a few references [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=878s) white envelopes.

And this comes from on the first Saturday of every month unless the first Saturday falls on like the 7th, then it has to be the last Saturday of the previous month. I can't remember. There's a whole thing. But anyways, usually the first Saturday of the month, the Brethren have what is called care meeting. And it is usually held early in the morning, although, you know, the Lord might have turned a corner on that. It might be a little later now, but it used to be I was in the Brethren, it was at 6am. And it was the meeting where the Brethren [locally,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=923s) in each of their individual places, gave away what money they had collected. So on Sunday mornings at their Lord's Supper meeting, they have collections.

And everyone is expected to give money. Some of this money is used for expenses for like the meeting rooms like you know propane or electricity or things like that however there is whoever's in charge of the money for that place keeps track of it and says at the beginning of this care meeting we spent we had this much at the beginning of the month we got this much in we spent this much on this this this and this and we have this much ready to give away. And so once it is a known fact, how much is ready to give away, then people, and by people, I mean men, can suggest who and how much is given. And invariably, a significant chunk like larger than most is given to the great man currently, Bruce Hales.

So they growing up in the small community that I did we didn't have a ton of extra money to give away like we usually gave away about I would say 800 to a thousand dollars every month and the majority of the gifts we gave were $50 but to Bruce Hales it was like $200.

And this is usually a cash gift it is tucked in a white envelope and given to someone who will be traveling to a meeting because there's monthly meetings everywhere it will be given to the next person and the next person until eventually it makes its way to Bruce Hales and just imagine from the hundreds of Brethren localities around the world some of [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1067s) are a lot bigger and have a lot more money to give away. Just imagine how much money Bruce Hales gets in gifts every month. And of course, that money that they're giving away at their collections on Sunday morning, that's a gift. It's a charitable gift. And what's given to Bruce Hales is a gift. So it's very [nice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1097s) Thousands of dollars every month. So it's also usually other important men will get given gifts too. Like if you're higher up in the Brethren leadership, you might get $50 or something like that.

Generally speaking, women do not get gifts. My mom was one of the very, very, very few women that actually got gifts. And I'll talk about why she got gifts tomorrow.

Hi everyone. Getting back to yesterday's topic about PBCC care meetings, the white envelopes, the gift giving.

When I left here yesterday, I was talking about the fact that women rarely, if ever, get gifts from other localities. However, my mom did.

And the reason why is a little bit complicated, but I'm going to kind of go off topic for a hot second. So the great men have always had their meetings, whatever you want to call them, published in what is called ministry. And the Brethren are all required to buy it.

Usually it comes out like quickly in what is called white books. And they're these little paper booklets. booklets, but then it comes out a little more formally in specific ministry and it's color coded for each great man. So like, you know, John Darby's was this color,

Frederick Raven's was this color, James Taylor's was this color, etc. And of course, it's a handy little moneymaker for the Brethren because each set of ministry costs a small fortune for the average household so that works out well too but anyways all of this is to say that all meetings are recorded.

There's a tape recorder picking up every single thing so back in the day of Jim Symington from Neche being the leader, his meetings were recorded and immediately afterwards a tape was handed off to my mom and she was a very very fast typist and she would quickly transcribe the meeting and it would be sent over actually back up back up [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1257s) would be handed off to my grandpa Seed, Wilbert, he would edit it and it would be quickly sent off to the Bible and Gospel Trust in England to be published and off to the Saints it would go so every poor soul that missed out on the live version of hell got to read about it lucky them so anyways this was something that my mom did in the early morning hours it was I guess [happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1287s) when I was born but I don't really remember it because he died right after I was born. But like all of my siblings, early years, my mom would talk about she got up at 4:30 in the morning, she typed until 6:30 when the kids started waking up. And then she would do her thing all day long with the kids, the housework, everything else, go to meeting that night, come home, she'd type her about an hour, she'd go to bed, she'd get up at 4:30 in the morning and do it again.

And because she typed all of Jim Symington's meetings, not just his local ones. She typed them when he like traveled, everything. They all ended up in her hands. And this was considered a great service to the Brethren. And so she was considered very special because she did this great service. And so she did actually get gifts from other localities for her service. And in later years, [long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1347s) after Jim Symington had passed, like this was probably when I was 15, 16\. She was contacted. Some new recordings were found of meetings of like John Hales and other great men and they were found to have never been transcribed and like how sad we've been missing out on all this wonderful knowledge and so she started back up again. She was back to typing, transcribing, sending this off to [England](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1377s). And so she once again was special and started getting money again. It was never a lot, but I feel like, you know, $25 here and there from random places. So, I mean, it was something. I mean, that was all the payment she got for doing it. It wasn't like she got a paycheck or something silly like that. I mean, she's a woman. What else does she have to do?

Whatever. Anyway, the only other time that women sometimes got gifts is if they were what was called an assembly widow. And if you're saying, what is an assembly widow? It's because that's a weird term, and I'm aware of that. An assembly widow is a woman whose husband was either kicked out of the Brethren or chose to leave the Brethren. So the husband is still alive. She's [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1427s) technically a widow but she's a widow of the assembly because her husband isn't part of the assembly and so assembly widows were often given gifts I shouldn't say often it wasn't often but occasionally given gifts especially if they were fighting like a custody battle um like where the husband had left the Brethren and was then fighting for custody of the kids then gifts would be given to that woman to help [fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1458s) for custody to make sure that the kids stayed within the Brethren. So there you have it. That is the final story on Brethren and their gift giving and the white envelopes. There you go.

Good morning, everybody. So today for my PBCC Fact of the Day, I'm going to talk about something that's fairly near and dear to my heart. I want to thank all of you. I've been getting so many messages and comments, asking for different topics, and I have such a long list now, and I love it. And I promise I will get to what you've asked about, I promise. But for today, I want to talk about something the PBCC [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1504s) do, but yet they take full advantage of. So I today have just finished donating platelets. I donated blood on Wednesday. So I wasn't eligible to donate blood again, obviously, but I was able to donate platelets. I am also a registered organ donor. And these are things that I am very proud [of.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1534s) I had a dear friend who passed away almost four years ago from cancer.

And she needed platelets a lot while she was going through her treatment.

And it's something that you can't just buy those. Somebody has to donate those.

And the Brethren, unlike Jehovah's Witnesses, they are happy to take blood transfusions. They will take platelets, but they aren't going to donate. Ever. It's not a fear of needles, by the way, which I understand some people have that. Some people have a complete fear of blood. Some people have a medical condition that causes them from being unable to. I get it. There's a million reasons why you [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1592s) donate.

But for the majority of people, so top of the list that they can't donate isn't usually that their church tells them they can't.

They also will accept organs from other people. Except hearts.

I remember when I learned that the first time, I'd be like, Okay, so if your heart is bad, and someone worldly dies and their heart is a match and would work for you, you can't take it because their heart isn't pure. And so then you wouldn't be pure?

Got it. Makes total sense. So anyways, they will gladly take blood, platelets, organs, except the heart. But they aren't going to offer those up. Those are big things, life-saving things. And again, like I say, I understand there's a million reasons why people can't donate.

However, your church telling you you can't, just usually not one of them. Another little fun tidbit about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. There you have it.

Good morning everyone. So for today's video, I'm going to talk a little bit about the Brethren and public assistance, health insurance, etc, etc. It's kind of a multi-parter, I guess. So I've been asked a lot of times over the years, how do the Brethren manage to get like SNAP or EBT? This is a like food stamp program in the U.S. How do they manage to get fuel assistance, like [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1702s) to help pay for fuel oil or propane for heating their homes? How do they manage to get all these public assistance programs but yet they seem to have tons of money like is the church helping them hide their money how is this working and truthfully I don't have a ton of knowledge about this like my parents were never on any of these programs and I don't really remember them being a super common thing with that said it would not shock me at all if this is [happening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1733s) You know, I can totally see here on your taxes, like, show that you made this large charitable donation to their school or church or you name it, and so therefore it drops your adjusted gross income nicely, and so maybe you would qualify for these programs. That would not shock me at all.

The Brethren manipulating a public system for their benefit would be just right on course that would be typical so kind of along those same lines then ties in with health insurance and funny thing when I was probably like 13 14 I remember my parents applying for a program um at that time it was called Minnesota Care. It was obviously I lived in the state of Minnesota and [medical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1784s) assistance wasn't really a thing so much then it was just Minnesota Care, but my parents didn't qualify because they were over income. But my one sister did qualify because she was like 20 and filed her own taxes and it showed she didn't make enough. So she qualified. So she was on this program called Minnesota Care, which was like super cheap health insurance that paid for everything. And it was perfectly fine. She was on it for a year or two. But the funny funny thing [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1815s) it was at that particular point the Brethren were not supposed to have health insurance and yet it was like a common practice there was like my sister was far from the only person that was on this and it was like looking back on it I think hmm so you weren't allowed to like go out and purchase your own health insurance plan but yet you could be on this public assistance program hmm sure makes total sense to me so like when my niece and nephew were born like my brother [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1845s) sister-in-law paid for their births out of pocket 100 percent um not a dime came from any insurance and that was with any medical bill so like growing up I really didn't go to the doctor that often like we went for our like initial well child checks and stuff like that that was probably very cheap but I was actually born in Canada because for one thing it was quite close to where I live but for another thing with the exchange rate it was a lot cheaper. And that was pretty typical of a lot [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1875s) Brethren born in my area around my time.

Grew up in the U.S. I'm a U.S. citizen, but I was born in Canada. Weird. Anyways, right as I was leaving, health insurance was starting to become a little bit of a thing. Like the Lord turned a corner, you know, as he does. And health insurance suddenly was becoming like, oh, we should have this and obviously I think part of it was it wasn't a huge deal because in other countries they have health insurance like government provided but [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1910s) U.S. not so much and it was becoming obvious that like these medical bills are not sustainable like how how do you pay for a surgery or something like that like like it's an insane amount of money and so suddenly the Brethren figured out that hey we should get into the health insurance world and much like a lot of other things we'll sell this through our company you know the Universal Business Team or whoever [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1941s) it will be a program that we offer to the saints but of course we're going to make bank on it and if I remember right at the time it was like the most useless insurance no demand nobody had ever heard of it. It was stupid. 

I don't know if now they have like normal insurance. I don't know how that works. I'm sure they're still trying to figure out a way that it can be a moneymaker for their [schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=1971s) or their business organizations. I'm sure. But anyways, that is kind of the story with the Brethren and health insurance. That's why they would never accept it. if they did work for someone other than Brethren that offered health insurance they would not take it. So very weird but once again another handy little thing that the Lord turned a corner on. Now they can have health insurance. So nice.

Good morning everyone. So for today's PBCC video I have been asked a few times about why the Brethren use all these gift cards or gas cards and what the deal is with them. So this is actually a fundraiser for the school and they are generally called script cards. They come from a scrip company that's S-C-R-I-P. I'm not really sure who first figured out this was a fundraising program [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2026s) once one Brethren locality figured out it was a moneymaker they all jumped on board because that's how they roll. So how it would work is my brother actually was in charge of the script sales for our local area so he would contact this script company and order all these gift cards and it basically depended on the retailer what they would offer so this script company would say contact I'll say Old Navy and say what kind of a fundraising deal can you offer us? And Old Navy would say, we can do 5%.

So then the script company would buy these gift cards, say $100 gift cards, but they're buying it for only $95.

And they're going to sell that card to my brother on behalf of the Brethren for $95.

However, my brother is then going to turn around and sell it to the Brethren member for $100 and it's worth $100. So the Brethren member gets their full value but my brother only paid $95 for it so the school gets that $5 difference.

You might think oh well it's not that big a deal but over a lot of different households and a lot of different gift cards it could add up to hundreds of dollars very quickly. And so the gas cards where that came from was one of the script cards was Citgo and Citgo had a gas station in our area and I think it was two percent so like on every gallon of gas two percent was coming back to the Brethren which added up fairly quickly and I remember it [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2133s) a huge crisis when it suddenly wasn't going to be a Citgo station anymore it was just going to be like a privately owned place and I can't remember I know my brother went and talked to the manager and I can't remember if they sold them themselves giving the discount or if the other way they would do it is there was a Box Tops for Education credit card and of course this was after the Lord turned a corner on credit cards so they could have those.

And so you got one percent back of all your purchases went to the school of your choice if it was put on this Box Tops for Education card so like anywhere that didn't offer script cards but was, say, a popular place that the Brethren went to, my brother would use his Box Tops for Education card, go and buy all these gift cards, and then at least they got 1% of those sales.

And they were even smart enough to capitalize on the Brethren's alcohol addiction. He went to a local retailer in our area and managed to purchase gift certificates from them, and that gentleman probably made a killing. I think he gave 2%, so like if he bought a $100 gift certificate, it was costing $98. But I mean, we went through thousands and thousands of dollars and that particular owner of that [liquor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2217s) store was getting all of the Brethren's booze sales in that area. So lots of money for him. It ended up being a good deal for him. I don't know if this is quite as common as it was like 20 years ago. It was really a big thing for a while, but I don't know if it's still quite as big of a thing. But it was a good moneymaker for the Brethren for quite a while. And you know, it's all about the money.

Hey everybody. So for today's PBCC video, I am going to talk about a topic I was actually just chatting with a friend of mine about this morning. We were kind of talking about deaths and I was saying how like it's kind of hard for me to think about the fact that if one of my family members were to pass away it's unlikely that I would be notified

in a timely manner at least. I might find out but it might be a week or two down the road.

And that's kind of hard to think about um you know losing someone in a more permanent way than I've already lost them and not even being aware of it but anyways that kind of segged into funerals and I've done a video before on the weirdness of the Brethren funerals but apparently I missed a couple pieces because she had no idea.

So if you live in one Brethren locality and a family member lives in another Brethren locality and they pass away, you don't go to their funeral. So like for an example, say you're a Brethren girl, you get married and you move to Chicago because that's where your husband is from. And a few years down the road, your mom, dad, sibling, whoever back in Winnipeg passes away, you don't go to the funeral [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2334s) all. 

And so same thing for weddings. You generally don't attend a wedding if you're not from that locality. So like my sister that got married right before I left the Brethren, she would not have attended my other sister's wedding because my oldest sister was living in Seattle with her husband at the time, so she wouldn't have come to the wedding and that's just normal right I just think it's another control thing along those kind of lines

A[lso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2364s) there generally is not no I shouldn't say generally there is not sympathy cards I literally had no idea about sympathy cards until I left I remember like the first funeral I went to I didn't I didn't do anything with the sympathy card I didn't know I needed to and I was mortified and it still is something that I have to like really remember and think about because I've never heard of such a thing and like you didn't do wedding cards [either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2394s) you could do a wedding gift but like a wedding card no like there was no box for cards or something like that so anyway there you have it a little more info on the PBCC

 Good morning everyone so for today's PBCC video i am going to talk about their little grocery stores Campus & Co. So full disclosure, I am not the most knowledgeable person on this topic because these actually came about after I left they [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2424s) starting there was like little mini stores when I left but it was nothing like it is now. So Campus & Co is, and I know this will come as a shock to you, a fundraiser. Yeah, almost like everything's all about the money, isn't it?

I know, weird. Anyway, Campus & Co is a private grocery store. Only Brethren members can access it. The average community member cannot just go in there and shop. I think like the one in Neche has like a keypad on it.

You'll have to enter that to get in there I know that um like especially in these rural areas like where I am like this definitely impacts the local grocery stores because suddenly you have like you know 50 60 households that aren't buying nearly as many groceries from these little grocery stores because they have their own and I have heard I don't know if it's true but I've heard that it's also quite common for them to shop [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2490s) the local grocery stores and buy sale items in huge quantities and then they take them to their little store and resell them at the normal price. So they're making money but of course they're still hurting that small grocery store, which they're such good neighbors aren't they good people. 

Anyway I have also heard again I do not know if this is true I'm hoping that someone will chime in and fill in some more of the details um that some of them have liquor stores in them I'm really curious if they have liquor licenses for these I would love to know more on the liquor side of things I mean because again much like money alcohol is their second favorite thing [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2537s) don't know it's just weird so yes this is a money maker for them this is this is part of their deal and one more way to just kind of keep money in their pockets instead of going to someone else there you go that's all I know about campus and co so today is a PBCC twofer simply because I had a funny experience last night that I just had to share. So it's quite amusing to see how [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2568s) Brethren will almost all wave at my husband, who was never Brethren. But me, I'm a little more head than this. A little bit less likely to get waved at. And of course, Blake thinks it's hilarious because he's like, man, they're Sherlock friendlier when I don't have you in the passenger seat.

Obviously, we live in a small town. Everybody waves at everybody. It's a thing.

But last night was pretty hilarious because we were driving by a newly purchased, being renovated, whatever you want to call it, future Brethren McMansion. And lots of local Brethren are there regularly working on this project and I wanted to see how it was progressing because I'm a nosy jerk and that's what I do and so we drove by and we were in my husband's work truck and there was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2625s) one Brethren guy, actually a cousin of mine, he was right out near the street and so my husband you know was waiting just like he normally would and I actually had the window rolled down and so I was like not very far away and I was waving nicely because I'm a nice human and it was so funny because this Brethren guy puts up his hand to wave and it was like you could see the second that we made eye contact and he realized it was me [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2656s) hand went down so fast gone no and I said to Blake I was like do you suppose that like if they wave at me that that like there's an invisible connection so I'll pull them to hell with me and so that's why they can't wave at me I I don't know but anyways I mean if you don't laugh you'll cry right hey everybody so today for my PBCC video I don't know that this is really so much an informational [thing,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2686s) kind of.

So I'm not at my regular job today.

I'm at the business that my husband and I have and a salesman stopped in. You know, one of those guys that likes to sell you life insurance or things like that. And I've met him before. He's been in here once or twice.

But today when he stepped into my office, he happened to see I had one of the newspapers from the articles about the Brethren that were in the Fargo Forum he's like oh a cult hmm cults lots of rules and they change all the time i'm like wow he's like you know the Brethren or something how cool so I just said yeah I was actually in that particular cult but I'm free yay so okay cool sit down start [talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2736s) and he's like say he's like I feel like I've ever asked you this before but like I'm just gonna ask you again he's like you're in relation to Curt Seed and I said yeah he's my brother, actually, but he's still in the cult and that's why he doesn't talk to me and also probably won't admit that he knows me. He's like well actually that's true because he said about a month ago I was visiting with him and I said do you know Beth Seed and he said no.

I don't know if you remember a few months ago I shared like the Brethren take photo albums and there's pictures and underneath people's pictures it says who their kids are and who they married and whatever and underneath my parents my name wasn't listed and I think I said something along the lines of like yeah I literally am dead to them and I literally am dead to them. That's not a joke.

And I'm smiling because if I don't smile I'll probably cry because like, really? You can't even acknowledge me to a random sales guy who knows nothing about the freaking cult. You couldn't just say, oh yeah, she's my sister.

Couldn't do that?

Also I thought the Brethren were pure and wonderful and you just lied.

Happy Thursday friends.

Hi friends, so today for my PBCC video I am going to talk a little bit about how the Brethren seem to kind of think they're above the law or the rules don't always apply to them. So recently a young man in Australia was convicted because he was driving drunk in an accident that ended up killing his younger brother and cousin, I believe it was.

That's really sad. Yes, he did wrong. Yes, he deserves to be punished for it. But now he's not only going to prison, he's being withdrawn from, of course, because he can't be part of the Brethren. And so in one fell swoop, he's losing everything and everyone he's ever known and going to prison.

And yes, he made a very bad choice, but also he was just doing something that he's seen lots of Brethren members do over and over and over and over again.

I mean, he's 100% a product of his own upbringing, but because he had this accident, this terrible thing happened, two people lost their lives, and yes, he's facing the punishment he deserves. But he's also now not qualified, not worthy to be a member of the Brethren. So he's dealing with that on top of the guilt he's [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2933s) facing and going to prison.

I remember when I was young, a young man in England had hit a girl who I believe was biking or rollerblading or something on a side street and killed her. And I can remember having special prayer meetings to pray that he would not be convicted because yes, you cannot be Brethren and be in prison. And the Lord did not turn a corner in that case. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2968s) guy was convicted of hitting and killing this little girl, um, because it turns out that there are consequences for our actions, even though the Brethren don't really feel that way. I knew of one very close-by situation where, um, a young man was driving way, way, way, way too fast, and I was actually told by an attorney that the father came [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=2998s) the room and said, deputies and everyone present, you know, what do we need to do to make this go away?

Yeah, that attitude is just not real great. I also recently learned of my nephew, apparently has a golf membership, thinking golf, which, side note, made me really giggle because golfing used to be terrible and you certainly couldn't have memberships to somewhere.

So I think that's funny. But also he was golfing at a time when people under 21 weren't supposed to be on the course. When he was told to leave, he left the spot where he was, but he just went to another spot on the course. And when he was told to leave again because he could not be out there at that time he's like you're not making me feel welcome here and the person talking to him said you're not welcome here.

You aren't supposed to be here right now but they genuinely don't think that rules apply to them. And that did not always be the case, I don't think. Because I feel like I was raised to be pretty respectful of my elders and pretty respectful of people in authority. And somewhere along the line in the last 10-20 years, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3092s) has just really gone out the window for a lot of people. It's like they just feel like they are better than that. And they can make their own rules, thank you very much. And it's like, no, no, you really can't. Like, laws still apply to you. Rules still apply to you. And throwing money at things isn't necessarily going to make them go away.

So I think there's some rude awakenings coming for some of them.

Anyway, there you have it. Hey, everybody. So, a fun tactic that I've noticed that the PBCC seem to be using is if someone questions them on anything or they get pushback on something they want to do or are doing, suddenly they're facing discrimination.

I say this because I'm thinking of, I just heard about my nephew who was on a local golf course and he was out there during ladies night, which for anyone who doesn't know, after 7:30 p.m. only ladies over age 21 can be on the course. I don't know that that's the thing everywhere but it's pretty common where I live.

And when he was told he couldn't be out there his response was I'm not feeling very welcomed here. Yeah you're not. You and any other 19-year-old male. Would not be welcome. This is not about you being Brethren, so shut up.

But I'm also referencing it about this. See above my head? I'm not good at the green screen thing, so I'm not going to try and point, but church member and application proponent Bill Wallace told the meeting, I can't ride a broomstick and I don't own a cauldron while claiming that it was religious discrimination that was behind much of the opposition to the development. The development in question is a new church, grocery store, child care center being built in an Australian neighborhood. You might think, [well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3217s) what's wrong with the church, grocery store, and child care center? Oh no.

It's the PBCC so of course the general public can't use any of those things. And most of the people complaining about it were saying, hey this is not going to be inclusive to the majority of our neighborhood pretty much none of us will benefit from this so why would we want this here this is useless to us which I think is fair not really feeling the discrimination thing I'm [thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3252s) that this is much more about like hey we actually can't benefit from this so why should we want you here.

But no, it's discrimination. So that'll be the next thing. Anything against them, more persecution, more discrimination. They suffer.

Hey everybody, so for today's video on the PBCC, I'm going to talk about the fact that when you're in the PBCC, you get to live at home until you get married.

Mm-hmm yep so you're 35 years old and you haven't found Mr. or Mrs. Right, you're still going home to mommy and daddy's every night lucky you.

I can't imagine that sounds terrible every time I see some of these poor people I'm just like Ugh.

I mean, it sounds awful. So yeah,

Guys that aren't married will buy houses. So they're ready. Even if they don't have like a future wife, they're buying a house. So, like in the small town where I live, currently I think there's like five houses that are owned by unmarried Brethren guys.

Who, as far as I know, aren't even planning to get married.

And they have these nice, beautiful, big homes.

The weird thing is it seems like sometimes some of them can like spend some time there like maybe a night or two a week they're allowed to but then you see them back at dad and mom's it's very strange and I don't understand i'm like oh did you get permission to go and watch tv at your own house you don't have to watch tv at dad and mom's tonight you get to have a [sleepover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3391s) with yourself at your own house that you've owned for a few years i don't know it's hinky isn't it.

Maybe it's not, maybe it's great uh it sounds terrible but in the meantime I just think it's really kind of not great in like these small towns because here we have like five houses. There are nice, lovely homes that could be housing families that are sending kids to the public school or any number of other things supporting the town in some way. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3433s) instead they're tied up sitting there empty with no one living in them at all.

And like one of them that I'm thinking of like it was a really nice house and the guy that's owned it like he's owned it now for a number of years I'm like there's like a board over a window in the garage and like he's letting the shrubs get all overgrown and it's just like, such good neighbors.

Good morning.

So for my PBCC video, I'm going to do a quick follow-up on yesterday's video about Brethren living at home until they get married. So one weird quirk that I didn't even think of when I was doing my video and then someone brought it up to me in a message later.

So yes when you are single you must live at home with your parents unless if you get married and your spouse dies then it's perfectly okay for you to live on your own whether you have kids or not then you can live on your own whether you're a guy or a girl it's okay I guess once you've been married doesn't matter for how long but then you're qualified to live on your own I guess.

It's very confusing.

I haven't found a spot in the bible where it talks about all these rules specifically but I'm clearly missing it because like here I am not still in the Brethren so I think it's the part where Bruce Hales just has control and say over everything, which, spoiler alert, does not exist.

I think it's so random the things that they do but anyways there you go.

Okay, so I guess I'm gonna do two PBCC videos today because I have to rant.

I just saw a thing where like two or three young Brethren guys in New Zealand were arrested for animal cruelty.

And I don't know, I feel like animal cruelty is like next level psychopath.

Like, what is wrong with you? Not okay.

Zero stars do not recommend but they like think nothing of it like it's no big deal and I'm like I've talked before about the fact that they don't allow pets in the PBCC you're not allowed to have pets and it's like animals mean nothing to them.

I knew of several Brethren individuals that would think nothing of literally trying to hit a dog or a cat that was running across the road why why would you go out of your way to try and hurt an animal like I would nearly kill myself swerving to avoid a squirrel and I don't even like squirrels.

You'll get withdrawn from probably for associating with me but you want to hit someone's dog or cat, no problem. No big.

I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

Like, are there no standards?

They pretend there's standards, but their standards are seriously skewed.

Good people indeed.

Okay, I think I'm done ranting for today. Bye now. So for my PBCC video today, I kind of struggle with which topic to pick, and this is kind of off the beaten path of what I've been talking about, but I was thinking about it last night, so I decided today was the day to dive into education a little bit deeper.

So Brethren and education has like many things changed a lot over the last couple decades. So we used to be able to attend public school like 100 years ago when I started school I was able to go to kindergarten first and second grade in public school but then we had like a one-room school that kindergarten through eighth went through. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3728s) had one teacher. It was tied to a public school, but only Brethren kids went there. And then after eighth grade, I was homeschooled.

And this was for a lot of kids in my generation.

And I was, I think, one of the lucky ones because my mom actually took it seriously and she taught us. Like, we didn't get every ride. No, no, we had to do the schoolwork. It was annoying, to be honest, but now I'm kind of thankful to have an actual education. But now, now, things are different.

We welcome OneSchool Global.

Doesn't it just sound, brethren?

By the way, side note, they're really into LinkedIn. That's like their social media, and I just giggle every single Brethren profile I run across. There's like some key terms they use, like streamline is one of them and I'm like oh did the same person like come up with the same script for all of you guys because like come on be original can we come up with some different words no no they are all going to streamline your things all your things all of the things they're streamlining but anyways [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3812s) so OneSchool Global is literally their like worldwide school system and they hire teachers, worldly teachers, because like none of their people are actually qualified because they're not allowed to go to university, which I'll touch on their quote-unquote university in a little bit because that gets me a little hot.

This might have to be a two-parter if I'm gonna get into that. But anyways, OneSchool Global. I don't know about all the campuses but I know about the one like right here where I am and I swear it's like they cannot keep a teacher for more than a couple years and I have heard from so many of these teachers that like first year oh yeah you know wonderful sunshine and rainbows and the second year it was like I can't do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3865s) I can't work for them like the kids don't have any respect,

which I talked about the other day I don't get that like that's a new thing I swear I think I don't know um but like there's just so little respect for women that's really hard to accept and it's just sad like it's really fallen apart and um like these schools they're literally not allowed to have non-Brethren kids in these schools. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3902s) learned from an administrator that there's an actual script that they have to read if people ask for their kids to attend school and they aren't Brethren.

And like the kids wear uniforms that cost a small fortune. And yeah, I would just like to know exactly how much these kids are actually getting out of this education. Maybe it's a lot but I feel bad for all the teachers that go there thinking like this is going to be a normal teaching job. It's not, sadly, like it is not.

Yeah okay so tomorrow I'm going to talk about their quote-unquote university because that one just gets me wild. Good morning, so for today's PBCC video I promise to talk about universities.

So this is just one that makes me shake my head. I mean they all kind of do but oh so if we back way way up I feel like in the like 50s 60s they actually were allowed to attend university and by they I mean men. I don't think I ever heard of any women but there was some that actually had like an accounting degree or doctors and they were legit they actually had their degrees but somewhere along the line the Lord turned a [corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=3986s) and they could no longer go to university however now they claim they have their own degrees.

So UBT, which is their Universal Business Team, or as I like to call it, the scam where they make Brethren businesses buy all this information from them to supposedly make their businesses better. Basically, it's where they learn that term streamlining that they love to use everywhere, left, right, and center, they're streamlining it all. Um they now offer and by offer I mean push people to go for an [ABM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4034s) degree, Advanced Business Method. It costs like 16 to 20,000 dollars to get this degree but it only takes like I don't know.

I forget how many months I read somewhere how many months but it's like way shorter and they basically come out of it feeling like they have 20 years of experience and they're only like their second year into working and I mean they basically have a Harvard level education with this MBA that's actually an ABM that let's be real. Sadly if they walked into any legitimate business in the world and handed them this piece of paper they would be laughed right out of the building. This is not [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4079s) legitimate thing.

And I'm like, you are literally actually telling these poor suckers that this paper is worth something. And I actually saw where someone that was in had messaged this lady that was out that was saying like, hey, you know, we do have this degree and it's like amazing and like yeah I did it while I was working full time and I mean like yeah I did have to put in like 50 hour weeks [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4111s) try and get this done but like now I am set and like it's amazing and I'm just genuinely trying to correct misinformation.

You poor sad deluded fool it's not real it's not a thing it's just another way to get your money and it's not worth the paper it's printed on. So then, one final piece to this rant.

Sometimes I like to go wandering around LinkedIn, or as I like to call it, the Brethren's Facebook.

For anyone who doesn't know, LinkedIn is basically like a network for professionals, And I have to laugh, there's like Brethren women on there that their profession is homemaker. Okay, cool. Not really what LinkedIn is for, but I get it. That's how you like connect and learn things. Because it's basically like Facebook for business.

But I went hunting around, looking at different Brethren's profiles. And I found one of my cousins. And he lists on there, under his education, mathematics from the University of North Dakota.

Excuse me while I just go bang my head against a wall because if he has a mathematics degree from the University of North Dakota then I have an accounting degree from the University of North Dakota.

Just because you took courses from the North Dakota Division of Independent Study, which is yes associated with the University of North Dakota, does not mean you have a degree. Those were high school level classes and you don't have a degree from the University of North Dakota.

But it looks good on paper, doesn't it?

And so like when you're going to sell your jobs and you tell your client, look me up on LinkedIn. They're like, wow, this person really knows their stuff. They have a degree. Like.

Yeah.

I love it.

Okay, that's what I have. I might have more to share later, but that's what I got for now.

Hey everyone. So, quick little PBCC blurb. Not really a topic, but I'm throwing it out there anyway.

So, obviously you hear me on social media a lot talking about the Brethren, and I just want to clarify. I'm sure that it seems like they still consume my every waking thought.

Because 90% of what I post on social media is about the Brethren.

But, and I know this will come as a shock to you, not everything on social media is the whole picture. I promise I allocate a very very small percent of my day a very small percent of my brain to the Brethren, and the main reason why I do post as much as I do is because I'm really hoping that it reaches [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4318s) that are still in the cult I know that they're watching a lot of us and I just really want it to sink in with them that there's a way out but I really don't like to allow the Brethren to occupy a lot of my time or a lot of my brain because I went through a phase where I did spend a lot of time spiraling down a rabbit hole going after different things, different practices, [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4348s) people. And I learned very quickly that it will make me a very angry, bitter person. And I didn't escape a religious cult to be an angry, bitter person.

So I just wanted to put that out there. Yes, I'm sorry. A lot of what you're going to see me posting is stuff about the PBCC but that is a tiny little piece of the whole picture and the whole picture is pretty darn good so I just wanted to throw that out there.

Hey everyone so for today's PBCC video I am going to talk about the Brethren practice of shutting up or withdrawing from, which is essentially their practice of shunning, if you will. So in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, if you do something to like break the rules, you will get usually to start with shut up or confined. It [basically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4418s) means you aren't allowed to attend church, but you plan on coming back. Like they plan on allowing you back, restoring you is what they call it. And it basically means like, yes, you did something wrong, but after a certain amount of time, you will have had time to think about your actions and you're going to feel very bad and you're going to apologize and you're going to come back. And usually when people are shut up or [confined,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4449s) it doesn't last super long.

When they're withdrawn from, a little more serious. They may or may not be planning to come back, and they may or may not be allowed to come back. Like me, I'm withdrawn from, and I'm not sure what it would take for the brotherhood to welcome me back. I am 100% certain that there will never come a day when I want to go back, but I am probably not real welcome anyways because at this point I have [performed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4482s) the ultimate sin which is speaking out against the cult. How dare I?

Yeah here I am. Oops.

Anyways it's a horrible practice in my opinion. Like for example when I was eight my parents were confined. Not really sure what they did that was wrong, but they were confined. And so me and my siblings were sent to live with other Brethren. It's quite common. Sometimes an entire family will be shut up, the children will stay with them, but then they can't have any contact with like grandpa, grandma, cousins that are still in the Brethren. It's this awful kind of like in-between place where you're not in the [Brethren,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4524s) as in you can't have contact with any Brethren, but you're not out either. So you're not really supposed to have contact with anyone that's not in the Brethren either.

It's a really lonely position.

And so when my parents were confined, at the time that it happened, my grandpa spoke very harshly about this. He did not want my dad to be confined. And my grandpa actually ended up getting withdrawn from over this. So in one fell swoop, I lost my grandpa and grandma and my dad and mom. Um, and I'm not sure why, but my dad and mom were confined for actually three years and three months, which is a heck of a long time when you're eight years old and almost 12 by the time they were restored.

Um, yeah, it's a messed up practice that really, um, takes a huge toll on families.

And that part of my life forever changed me. I mean, there's not even a question, the things that happened during that time, like you don't, you don't get over those things. Um, it's a pretty sick practice.

Icky. Like a lot of cult things.

Anyway, that's what I have for you today. Cults. They suck. All the time.

Good morning. So today for my PBCC video, I thought I would talk a little bit about when communication with my family changed after I left the Brethren. So, some of you know, some of you maybe don't know, I have been out of the Brethren for almost 17 years now, which is wild.

When I think back to those early days, like 17 years sounds unattainable. So it's pretty amazing.

Okay, I'm done. I'm done being emotional about that part of it. Okay, so it's been almost 17 years that I've been free.

But when I first left the Brethren, initially, I had given my parents a cell phone number they could reach me at, and I was being absolutely inundated with phone calls. And voicemails, I've said before that the little voice that says you have one new voicemail is 100% a trigger for me. Because in those days it was relentless. My voicemail was full all the time, Brethren, all over the [world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4705s)

It was awful.

And so I don't remember exactly what point. some of those early days are a little bit of a blur but I don't think it was more than about a couple weeks and I was like I can't I can't live like this.

And so I changed my number and I gave the new number to my mom and told her, you cannot share this with anyone outside of my immediate family if I get a phone call from anyone outside of my immediate family will not be doing that nope and she was okay with that but she asked if we could stay in contact she wanted to make sure I was like alive and well basically yep okay so for the first number of years we talked twice a week and by talked I mean like I would call first thing [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=4766s) the morning hello how are you good have a good day that was the sum total there was no information shared to anything like that. It wasn't a big conversation. And that went on for quite a while. And then it went to once a week. Every Monday morning, I would call. Hello, how are you? Have a good day. Talk to you next week. Bye. Okay.

If she wasn't home, I just left a message that I was checking in.

And then it was around 2019, 2020\.

I started kind of having a breakdown.

Because I hadn't really dealt with the fact that I left the Brethren. I kind of tried to pretend like that part of my life didn't even exist. And for anyone who has done that, you know, it only lasts so long.

And I started going to therapy, started kind of processing things. And I started seeing things a little more clearly.

And I started questioning my mom a little bit more, pushing back a little bit.

And that was when it all started to fall apart in the communication.

By the end of August of 2020, August 26th to be exact was when I got an email from my parents saying they could no longer communicate with me because it was obvious that I was in such opposition to the Brethren's position.

Um side note I really hadn't changed my views at all the only difference was I had started pointing out the flaws in a lot of their beliefs. And the minute that happened, they couldn't communicate with me anymore.

So to me, it was a pretty clear sign that we can talk to you. It's okay.

But if you question us, we're done.

So now, I don't really have any contact with my family. Very, very minimal. I still send cards on Mother's Day, Father's Day, my dad and mom's birthdays.

It's hit and miss whether they acknowledge them at all. They don't send them to me.

So that's that's how excommunication worked for me and it was weird too for all those initial years when I wasn't pushing back I wasn't confined apparently I found out later I guess I could have just strolled back in at any time but then when I started questioning things I was very quickly confined and then withdrawn from.

Funny how that works.

Yeah.

Don't question the Brethren. That was the message I got. In case you haven't noticed, I haven't stopped. So I don't plan to anytime soon. I will keep shoving it in their face every chance I get that your belief system is messed up and so so twisted but anyway there you go. 

Good morning everyone so for today's PBCC video [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5001s) gonna try and lighten it up a little bit I feel like my videos lately have been a little gloomy and so I'm like yeah gotta try and find something more good. So I have been asked a ton of times over the years, is there anything you miss about being in the PBCC?

And it's taken me forever to answer this question because I had to really think about it. And truthfully, everything I could come up with that I missed about the Brethren was actually that I miss things about my family. I miss my family, I miss my mom's cooking, I miss hanging out with my sister, you know, things like that. But as far as the actual PBCC, and did I miss anything about that, I've really struggled to come up with anything. Which is probably a good thing, because it's a cult, and I shouldn't miss it. like I don't miss going to meeting every night I don't miss being told what I can wear how to do my hair where I can live the list goes on and on [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5073s) I thought for a long time is there anything I do miss and I finally came up with one thing one so during the Brethren meetings they do not have any musical instruments at all, but they sing hymns usually a couple times on the Sunday main meeting three times. 

And so where I lived, the group of Brethren that would get together on Sunday was like five, six hundred people. And the singing [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5103s) pretty awesome. I have to say, when you have like five or six hundred voices singing holy holy holy it's pretty cool like that many voices raised in worship it it was it was cool it was like I say I think the only thing I miss so there you have it that's what i got for you today so [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5134s) more quick PBCC thing I have had so many people comment, message, things like that Say, you're so strong, you're so brave.

And I just want to clarify something I am not strong or brave.

I am just doing the best I can. Making the best decisions. And there are so many people out there that are so much stronger and braver than me. People that have lost their moms, dads, children, siblings. For real.

Mine are still alive.

And so I have hope. And as much as it hurts because I grieve them oddly every day, I also still have hope.

Until the day I die or they die, that hope is going to stay alive that someday they will get out of this cult.

So really I'm not strong or brave compared to so many other people out there that are so much stronger and so much braver than me I appreciate you guys saying that but I just wanted to clarify that I’m not I have been blessed with so many people in my life that have pulled me through some really rough times when I assure you there was nothing strong or brave about me. So really I'm just a girl being pulled along by a [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5235s) of other awesome people holding on to hope. That's me.

Nothing strong, nothing brave. I promise.

Good morning. So today for my PBCC video I'm going to talk about how I knew that I had been kicked out of the Brethren, confined, withdrawn from the good stuff. So as I've mentioned before, this did not happen until I'd been out of the Brethren for quite a while, like about 10 years, maybe even a little longer, probably more like 12\. So, it was in 2020, after I started questioning the Brethren a little bit more.

And one day in the fall of 2020, I got a message from my mom, could I call her? Sure. We weren't that far out from the time when I still was calling them regularly, but they had cut off contact with me at this point.

But I called and my mom answered me you know hello how are you.

And then she said dad is here and he would like to talk to you and I'm like oh okay cool happy to talk to my dad and so he came on the phone and he said that I'm just letting you know that the Brethren have decided to confine you. You are now shut up.

Cool.

I'm not in the Brethren, so that term really doesn't mean anything to me, but I got it.

I'm now officially on the bad list. Not the bad-est list, but I'm getting there.

So, it's fine, life goes on, and in January of 2022, which was about a year and a half after they had confined me I got an email from my dad one morning it was before I went to work and it said that can you give me a call.

So I called him and he answered and he said I just have to ask you are you happy with the path you're on and I said yes and he said you no longer seem to want to walk with the Brethren. I'm like oh I gave it away the last you know 13 years give or take.

Yeah I'm not wanting to walk with the Brethren you are right and he said well because of your position against the Brethren we have decided to withdraw from you and I said okay and then I just said to him I said you know that term doesn't mean a thing to me I'm not in the Brethren and so it doesn't mean anything that's your term but okay thank you for letting me know and then after I hung up with him I thought hmm I'd like to know a little more so I emailed him and said can I just ask what is the basis for the Brethren withdrawing from me and he said it's 2nd Timothy chapter 2 and I said okay is there a specific verse or [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdkxJpQGr4M&t=5434s) the whole thing and he responded 2nd Timothy 2 verses 19 until the end of the chapter is our charter 2nd Timothy 2 there's a reference to withdrawing from evil and so I am evil according to the Brethren and my family. I mean I didn't know they could sit on the judgment seat.

But who am I? I'm just an evil girl.

So anyways, that is how I knew and since then I don't have a lot of contact with my family at all.

Just an evil girl out here doing evil things like being married to a worldly guy and having a worldly job and worldly friends and doing worldly things.

Terrible. Anyway, there you go.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
