## Summary

Richard Marsh takes us through his role in the Klondike Papers and leads us into a heated discussion on politics and the PBCC. The PBCC will not allow its members to vote, and claim to have no interest in politics. Indeed, as a registered charity, they  cannot legally engage in political campaigns. We peel back the veneer of lies to show how the PBCC  has become by far the most influential cult in Canadian politics, using its members to give targeted donations to political causes on demand, and how they were intimately connected with Stephen Harper's election campaigns. We also give you a heads up on Jesse Brown's new podcast series "Ratf*cker" which will be a fruitful romp through the legendary "Klondike papers" leading on to the even darker crimes committed in Maple Creek.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. With me today, we've got Cheryl, Richard, and Carman again. Hi, everyone. Hey.

So, Richard, do you want to dive into some really deep stuff right away? Like the Klondike Papers? I know there's people waiting to hear about these Klondike Papers.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=24s)

Yeah, for sure. Well, the Klondike Papers is basically David Wallace's archives for the last four to five years. And by archives, I mean it's the entire contents of three or four email accounts he was running, his Twitter message feed, his Facebook message feed, and his text messages on several phones. Who is David Wallace? David Wallace is the private investigator [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=54s) was hired by the Brethren to hunt me down. He's also a political operative, or he was, he's kind of retired now.

He worked for the conservative or a number of right-wing groups in Alberta in particular, basically doing dirty tricks to try and drag down and discredit opposing politicians and city councillors on behalf of some right-wing politicians there.

So because David was working with the right-wing politicians in Alberta, he became acquainted with Gerald Chipeur, or rather I should say, Gerald Chipeur had heard about the amazing things David could do. Gerald Chipeur is the long-time counsel or attorney for the PBCC in Canada. He's handled a whole bunch of their [cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=120s), and so Gerald Chipeur then recommended David Wallace to the Brethren as being an ideal guy to do some dirty tricks on me.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=135s)

And they were hunting you because you had dirt on them, basically. You had a lot of dirt on them.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=143s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So Gerald Chipeur gets in touch with David Wallace. David Wallace is introduced to Rod Diplock, Brad Mitchell, and Mick Strange.

Who else was on the team? Those are probably the main kind of characters. And this was all, amazingly enough, this was all done on UBT Zoom calls and UBT emails. So this isn't just, you know, Brad Mitchell pursuing a personal vendetta. This is UBT business. This is church business.

And the whole thing was facilitated by, I forget her name now, a sister who's like a top UBT secretary, Suzanne Railton. Suzanne Railton, I remember that name. Yeah, she's from down in the US somewhere, originally from Brighton I think, or Hastings in the UK. You know, they're all big names in the Brethren.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=210s)

Brad Mitchell was the one that's running Klondike Papers, that's kind of orchestrating hiring someone to find you, is that correct?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=219s)

Yeah, Brad Mitchell is the founder and president of Klondike Lubricants, which is where we got the name Klondike Papers from, because a lot of his emails were from a Klondike Lubricants email address. I mean, the guy's got a whole bunch of hacks. He's using UBT emails. He's using Klondike Lubricant emails. He's using Ox Tools emails. And Ox Tools, of course, is Dean Hales's business, huge global Brethren business.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=248s)

So Brad Mitchell is clearly connected right to the Hales at the top.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=252s)

Yeah. And Brad Mitchell refers in the Klondike Papers to getting instructions from Global.

Now, I don't know what Global is, whether that's a term for a number of Brethren organizations called Global. They've got a global organizing group, which is referenced a number of times. There's UBT Global, or Global might just be a reference to Bruce Hales because he is kind of a globular shape. So that would be quite a good reference.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=281s)

And so did I read somewhere that they made the payments to David Wallace from Klondike Lubricants?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=287s)

No, well, it turns out they made the payments through Tilsonberg Tube, which is Keith Prince out of Tillsonburg.

And then they paid Gerald Chipeur, or rather Gerald Chipeur paid David Wallace through a guy called Alan Hallman, who is Jason Kenney's right-hand man, where Jason Kenney is, or, well, he's just finished actually, but he was the Premier of Alberta for many years. So the payments were going through these political channels and they were being put through businesses on the other side of the continent.

Obviously trying to keep a kind of a firewall in the paper trail between what's obviously the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and these kind of dirty backstreet operators who were trying to hunt me down. I mean, even Chipeur didn't want to be associated with David Wallace. He goes through back channels to make the payment.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=350s)

Now, let me ask you this, Richard. Do you think that some of these politicians and some of these figures that are operating up at these higher levels, do you think that they know that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church hides sexual abuse of children?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=368s)

Hard to say. In Australia, I think they're pretty well aware of that because there were some very, very high-profile cases exposed by Michael Bachelard. But I think in Canada, it's unlikely they would understand that. I don't think there have been any very publicized Canadian cases until Cheryl came forward and you came forward. And of course, we know there's a whole lot more in the wings.

But yeah, this is really the point, is to make politicians aware that if they're approached by members of the PBCC or their businesses, we are watching and we will call you out. Because no public servant, no one who's on the taxpayer's dollar, should be having anything to do with these people. You know, they shouldn't be touching them with a barge pole.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=417s)

Yeah, and I think that's important for the viewers to know why we're doing this and why we keep exposing this. And why we're bringing up what we're going to bring up today from way back when is because of the exposure. People inside the PBCC need to understand what's been happening. The politicians need to understand what they've gotten involved into.

So the reason why we keep coming back to all this past stuff and the videos and stuff that we're going to show you today is because we need to bring it to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=447s) present so everybody can understand what's at stake here. Because if we keep on continuing, like, okay, well, the past is the past, and we're just going to leave it there. None of this truth gets excavated to be able to show the politicians the church that they're involved in. And those people that are within the church need to understand what they're being hidden from, that's really happening with these higher elite people that are part of the church.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=474s)

100%. It does. Politicians need to run from them very, very fast. But to get back, Richard, can you tell the listeners too, again, just to finish off that Klondike Papers, how close they got to you and how close David Wallace got and how you convinced him?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=494s)

Well, this is very interesting because, so cutting a long story short, David Wallace was hired on a very fat retainer to hunt me down. David became, I mean, David is a political dirty tricks guy. And so he's out there to smear people's reputations, to dig dirt on people and put it in public for obvious political reasons.

But what David isn't is he's not a murderer. He doesn't like physical violence.

And it's one thing where you've got a battle between two ugly politicians. You've got a scumbag on one side, a dirty rat on the other. Who cares who wins the election, right? But what David felt uncomfortable about is he was being hired, not to kind of dig dirt on some big dirty politician. It's being hard to hunt down this guy. And of course the first thing a private investigator does when they're given a name to find is do some background research.

So David [does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=561s) some background research for me, finds out what this Marsh guy is all about. He was told I was a criminal with an arrest warrant out for me. Of course what he finds out is I'm an ex-cult member and a whistleblower and someone who speaks out against the church. And then he does some further investigation. He contacts Nathan Jacobson, who's a sort of a big, you know, he's a billionaire and a really international ex-Mossad [billionaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=592s) businessman. Well, he's not Israeli, but he was in the Israeli defense forces, an old client and friend of David's.

Anyway, Nathan Jacobson has contacts in the police, so says, ask the police, you know, we've got this criminal we're looking for, what does the record say? The police say, no criminal record, the guy doesn't exist, there's no arrest warrant for this guy, you won't find any trace of him.

So Nathan Jacobson confronts Gerald Chipeur with this fact, says, "Gerald, you've been lying to me. What are you really after this guy for?" And it pretty much comes out that it's basically the Brethren desperate to silence me because I've got so much dirt on them.

Nathan and David decide, look, there's absolutely no way we're going to hand this guy over to the Brethren.

And so they then decide, having dug a bit further into Brethren history and what these people are like, they then decide they're going to kind of rescue me and help me to escape from this bunch.

So David phones a contact of mine, a guy called Dr. Kirat Singh, who I met originally when he was a customer.

I've known him for about 15 years. He's an excellent guy, very quietly spoken, very intellectual Sikh professor of physics.

And so David Wallace phones Kirat Singh and says, "Tell Richard to get out of Toronto, get out of the province, go and hide somewhere because these guys are fanning out, they're coming after him. And, you know, I'm fearing for his life. I don't want to do this. They've hired me to find him. But it's essential they don't lay hands on this guy."

Kirat recorded this conversation. And I then sent the tapes and was helped by some other ex-Brethren to kind of turn it into a YouTube video, with some background information and some images and so on. Basically just most of the recording of David Wallace's phone call and some extra bits of information, put that online, it went viral to a degree in certain circles, and then that got picked up on by a CityTV producer, who then contacted me, which led to the whole Breaking Brethren documentary being produced. It was picked up by James DiFiore. And, you know, that's really how the whole present kind of movement [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=761s).

And then of course Cheryl sees this and she speaks to James and you know the whole thing snowballs because basically there's such a weight of scandal and pain and trauma inside the Brethren in North America that's been building up and building up. It only took one small hole in the balloon for it to all start flooding out, which is why the Brethren are now trying to build a Noah's Ark or something to escape from it.

So I went public with the video, media starts taking interest, David got a whole load of grief from the Brethren, there was like people sneaking around his house, his house was broken into, they were trying to steal his computer, they were trying to hack his computer. They were doing everything they could because the Brethren realized, and Chipeur realizes, that there's a danger that [David's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=824s) going to hand over all his communications he had.

So I told David from day one, I said to him, "Listen, David, the Brethren are going to try and hack your computer, and if they fail, they're going to try and break into your house." Both those things happened inside a week of me telling him that.

And then even in the Klondike Papers, there's a message from Alan Hallman to David Wallace saying, "The Brethren want to buy your old computer and they'll give you a new one."

Anyway, this had the opposite effect of what they intended because what David did, he was so furious that the Brethren thought he was so stupid and so furious from them trying to break into his house and hack his computer. He said, "Right, well, I'm going to give you everything. I'm just going to give you everything." He's kind of an impulsive guy. When he's made his mind up, when someone's annoyed him, there's no half measures. So he literally, he sent me his phones. I should have got them. Let me show you. These two cracked up old cell [phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=888s), and he gave me all the access to his email accounts, access to his Twitter account, everything.

And this wasn't filtered. This also contained, about 70% of it was actually his kind of personal stuff, family photos, letters to his girlfriend, you know. So it was a huge, huge dossier of all kinds [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=918s) information in all kinds of different formats. Fortunately, at that time, I was kind of between jobs. I wasn't working full time. I had some time on my hands. And I spent two months, much to my wife's annoyance, just ploughing through all this stuff. Every single email, I had to go through it all, through it all, and kind of weeding out the personal stuff, deduplicating it, and converting it all into PDF format.

So all the emails are converted to PDFs. All the text [messages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=948s) are converted to PDFs. And then there were 20 or 30 long audio recordings, because David had a recorder on his phone, so long, long audio recordings with all these people he'd worked with. Those all had to be transcribed. That was probably the biggest part of the job, was just listening to hours of audio, and typing them out, turning them into PDFs.

And then the beauty of PDF is you can OCR it, you can make it searchable. So I assembled [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=979s) of this data into one massive, I think it was 6,500-page PDF, and did an OCR search on it. So the whole, you know, the computer reads the whole thing. And then you can type in any keyword, and it'll pull up all the references. So now, if you take the Klondike Papers document, and you type in Rod Diplock, it will pop up 300 references of Rod Diplock, Alan Hallman, or any other name.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1006s)

And let's show the listeners that. Do you have a clip for us today, Cheryl, about these guys and how closely related they are to politics?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1019s)

Yeah, so we do, we have the clip of Stephen Harper's acceptance speech.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1026s)

That's right. Now so the listeners understand, we're not kidding around when we say the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have connections to high levels of government. And what we question is, do these people of the government realize that they're connected to a terrible, terrible cult? And let's look at how connected they are. Go on, Cheryl, tell us what we're seeing here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1051s)

Okay, so this is the video, just after, right at Stephen Harper's victory speech. So we'll just play this. This was Chuck Truan.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1067s)

An American.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1069s)

Roy Taylor.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1070s)

Canadian.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1072s)

Brad Mitchell, Ron Barnes, and Ralph Mooney.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1085s)

All top members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and I think one of them at least was American.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1092s)

Yeah, Chuck Truan's Detroit, yeah. 

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1103s)

You know what, we do need a disclaimer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1106s)

You know what, that actually was going straight into the Breaking Brethren VeraCity documentary, is what happened there. Another good documentary.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1115s)

And you know...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1116s)

I know people have challenged, have taken this video to people inside and said like, "Hey, do you know about this?" and the response back was they do know about it and they've been told that those five people were there to let Stephen Harper know that they were there to support him and his changes he was going to make and to offer his prayers to him.

I'm like, and people are buying that? I think it's super [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1146s) for anybody who's inside who's watching this to be able to really wrap your mind around when you understand the Klondike Papers, and we understand what happened with Richard, and then you see something like this. And then we have other stuff that we're going to show you, but you've got to realize that five people don't need to show up at the front row of this to offer his support and prayers. And I want to reiterate that over and over again, that that just doesn't add up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1174s)

Let me give you a little more... So I don't know. Good, go on, Carmen.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1181s)

No, go ahead. I was just going to say, and you notice in that, Chuck Truan is from the States. So what is Chuck Truan doing at a Canadian election event? You know, just a really interesting fact to note there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1195s)

Yeah. And the way I came across this video is, I was contacted by an ex-member who wants to remain anonymous at the moment, and he was actually watching live TV of this Stephen Harper's victory speech, which was going on in a convention centre in Calgary. This is like the very night of the election. They've just finished counting the votes. This is late at night. He's watching this [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1226s) the cameras panned in on Stephen Harper saying his stuff.

And then when Stephen Harper finishes the main part of his speech, he walks over to the edge of the stage and he shakes hands with these guys. And this ex-brother was astonished to see that there was, and it was actually zoomed in on the original video, there's Stephen Harper shaking hands with Chuck Truan, [American](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1257s) citizen. It's the first person he shook hands with after accepting that victory nomination. The first guy he shakes hand with is Chuck Truan.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1268s)

That begs the question, how much money did Chuck Truan give to be sitting in that seat?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1276s)

Exactly. And then Stephen Harper goes on to shake I think three or four out of the five. So Stephen Harper's standing on the edge of the stage. These five Brethren members stood up, so they were kind of, you know, the stage is like waist-high to them. Stephen Harper's leaning over, shaking their hands in turn, and then Stephen Harper goes back to the podium and Stephen Harper's family walks in, his wife and kids. So anyway, this was on public Canadian television.

### 

The guy then emails in, within the next day or two, he emails in to CBC or whatever the Canadian broadcaster was and says, "Do you realize that this is actually like an American citizen he's shaking hands with?" and so on, sort of explains these are the Brethren, thinking that the broadcast would make some news of this and ask some questions.

But no, what happens is when they publish that particular clip [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1337s) their channel and on YouTube, the segment with Stephen Harper shaking his hands with the Brethren is deleted out. So in fact, if you watch that video on CBC now, you see Stephen Harper finish his speech. He starts walking to the edge of the stage. Then the camera cuts away to Laureen Harper and the kids walking in. And when the camera gets back to Stephen Harper, he's back at the podium. So someone raised the alarm and [political](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1367s) pressure was put on the broadcaster to take out the segment in which he's shaking hands with the Brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1374s)

And this is why I say you've got to put your pieces together, right? They weren't just there to offer their support and prayers.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1383s)

No. And do these politicians realize that these are the same guys that are so racist, their group/little church that they belong to, will not allow interracial marriage?

Like that's how backwards they are. They do not believe that homosexuality is a thing. It's just a choice. They will not allow any homosexuality, any homosexuals in their entire church. Absolutely.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1410s)

And if they find that someone is, they'll try and chemically castrate them with drugs.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1417s)

That's a fact. There's recorded stories of them prescribing, illegally prescribing medical castration drugs to people inside this church. And one case was literally just because the person came out as homosexual.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1434s)

Yeah, I mean, Craig Hoyle is his name and he's actually got, I think he's actually got a documentary on him. Yeah, there's a documentary on him.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1445s)

The Brethren doctor who administered it was kicked out of the Medical Association, wasn't allowed to practice because it was malpractice to misuse his ability to give a prescription in that way. And you can actually find the hearing online before the Australian Medical Association, in which he admits to giving this guy these drugs and he gets kicked out.

But this is Canada, this is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and you do not get into the front row of the Prime Minister's acceptance speech. I mean, they didn't just turn up on the night, you know, with a Tim Hortons in their hands and say, "Hey, mind if we come in?" You know, this is an invitation-only event. And to get right on the front row. How much did you give? Exactly. That puts you in a very, very elite class of political sponsors.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1503s)

Yeah. And that kind of brings us into something else that we want to talk about and share. Do you want me to share that? The elections donations that the Brethren have offered?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1518s)

Oh yes, let's see. So let's remember for a second here that they do not allow their members to vote. They do not allow their members to vote, but this is what you can do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1535s)

So this is an advertising report, election advertising report. So we're just going to, we're not going to go through all this. And I know Carmen has a lot of information on this, but we're going to just go into Maple Creek.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1553s)

You better read those names out because they're pretty small.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1557s)

They're small. Yeah. So we've got Specoy Acounting. I don't know who that belongs to.

There's Roger Drever, Dale Bowyer, Harry Drever, Marion Drever.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1569s)

I can do his voice, hold on. Harry Drever\! No, I can't do it. I can't do it. He has the weirdest voice I've ever heard in my life. Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1582s)

That's what. Marion Drever, Hazel Brown, Bruce Drever, Briarside Supply Company.

Morris Hope, of course he's on there.

Mid-Country Laminating, Mary Boyer, that's it for Maple Creek.

Yeah. And I mean, I think this is what people need to be inquiring about is like, if there is such a dead set against voting, I just don't understand how it is okay. And I know that there's been documentary of people inside being like, we can't say who people are helping associate themselves with politicians. And, you know, we don't have a rule that they can't offer them money. But what is the logistics that if you can't vote, if you are not allowed to vote, what is the difference if you're going to give your money to certain politicians?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1645s)

Well, and just how many years ago, I remember when my little one brought home a UNICEF box from school. And she asked if she could collect some money, even from around the house, and put it in that box. And she went to one of the elders in Winnipeg and asked, because at that point we were in Winnipeg, she said, "Can I put some money in this box and take it back to school?" And they said, "Absolutely not, we do not mix our money with other people's money and then give it [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1675s) a contribution." Excuse me, is Brethren money better than other people's money or why can it not be mixed? And is this not the same money?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1684s)

I don't know, that is insanity.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1690s)

This is just one little area of all the lists of the Brethren that have donated in here. This is just the Maple Creek area.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1697s)

Of course, there's a huge hypocrisy here because this was just at the same time as the Brethren were campaigning against gay marriage right across Canada. Huge efforts, and they were using all kinds of fake names and using their middle names and so on.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1715s)

Do you remember the prayer meetings around gay marriage? Oh yeah, yeah. That the prayer would not be passed? Yeah. Huge prayer meetings asking the brothers, "Please pray harder, pray harder." Uh-oh, looks like it didn't work. Do they accept that it didn't work and that their prayers were not answered and that the bill went through just fine? No, they didn't pray hard enough. We didn't donate enough money.

Why do they need to donate money to their political [causes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1746s)? That is in complete contradiction of their power of prayer. I mean, if they're the chosen people, one Brethren prayer should be worth like 10,000 Dalai Lama prayers, right? It should be insanely powerful. But they don't even believe in the power of their own prayers. So now they got to donate money.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1765s)

Just to make sure it happens, you know. But there's a huge irony here, because here's Morris Hope and Harry Drever giving large sums of money to try and prevent gay marriage because they think gay people are terribly immoral and it'll lead to a breakdown in the moral order in Canada. At the same time, they're covering up horrific cases of child abuse in their own Maple Creek congregation. So how do they rationalize that in their own heads, please?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1800s)

It's just so disheartening. When you sit back and look at the whole humanitarian part of this, it's just so disheartening that we have just a congregation that has such distorted morals.

And how many thousands of people are okay with this kind of happening? Let's give all this money into political parties, but yet we're not taking care of the families that are ripped apart. We're not taking care of the innocent teenagers that are thrown out onto the streets. I guess my plea is just like, you guys have got to wake up and look at the realistic black and white abuse that's happening.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1850s)

Oh, they can't see the forest for the trees that are right in front of them. You know, how they're going to swallow this abuse pill, I just don't know. You guys, and I'm talking to Brethren members in there, you guys have covered up terrible, terrible crimes for years. And we're going to keep talking and we're going to keep telling you about them until you are fucking dying for us to shut up. We're going to bring more [guests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1880s) on and we're going to hear their stories. We're going to hear about sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse, how excommunicating is one of the evils that you promote in that church, right?

This separation that is just the ego telling you that you are better than and different than other human beings. And you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1910s), one day, one day if there is extraterrestrial life out there and we get visited, I will bet every dollar I have that the first words out of their mouth if they learn how to speak English will not be, "Is Bruce Hales here?" You know, there's infinite life throughout the universe. We have no idea, and it's just right, the possibilities are unimaginable. And the thought that they are these special people, well if you're [special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1941s), then be special and tell the truth. You know what I mean? Like, how many people in there know deep down, they feel themselves like, something's not right about what I'm doing?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1955s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1956s)

Well, we're the people that are telling you from the outside, you won't see any of us rush back, okay? Nobody out here is going to tell you that you're going to be rich and that crazy success, man. And I feel bad because the Brethren seem to be so obsessed with money now and the rest of the world is kind of coming to this realization that, oh, material things are not everything in life. And the Brethren are [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=1986s) far behind the rest of society, so many years back, that they're still thinking that if I get the biggest house, Jesus is going to maybe put me in the VIP section on the plane up to heaven. Like that is just their ego.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2003s)

The irony is they're more worldly than the world is. I mean, all our lives we've been brought up, "the world, worldliness, you mustn't be worldly," and now they're far more worldly than your average citizen. And then take somebody like Maple Creek, it's this very small community. And it's kind of split in two, there's the ordinary folk of Maple Creek, and then there's this exclusive little band of people who won't eat with them, won't associate with them, won't put their money in the same money [box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2034s).

And the reason is that that little band of people is withdrawing from iniquity, they're separating from evil. And if they broke down that wall of separation, then you know they might get contaminated. And then we find out that inside that little exclusive area of wonderful purity, there's pedophiles operating. The worst and the wickedest things are going on in the sacred area. It's not the ordinary folk of Maple [Creek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2064s). So what sense does that kind of wall of separation make? The fact is the wall of separation has been protecting the ordinary people of Maple Creek from the wickedness in the Brethren.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2079s)

And I think it's important to note too, for how many years they preached, they said, "We don't vote, we don't vote, we don't have anything to do with politics." And you look at that sheet that Cheryl put up, and there's 11 people on there that have donated from Maple Creek in that particular year. That's almost 10% of their local meeting has donated in secret.

And if you went in there and asked other people that aren't on that list if the Brethren participate in politics, they would [almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2109s) uncertainly, they would almost certainly say, "We don't have anything to do with politics." So 10% of them are making donations and hiding it. You know, and amazing when you type it in, it's publicly available information. It's all out there.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2128s)

So they don't even stick to their own rules. You know, they bend them because the Lord takes a corner and it's so utterly convenient. But when you look at other cults, you're like, oh my goodness, they're so similar. They want to bring us back into a time where abortions are illegal, gay marriage is gone, and Bruce Hales just, you know, everybody bows and scrapes to him. Well, I'm telling you, [Putin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2158s) doesn't call Bruce Hales and ask him advice, okay? Xi Jinping does not call him.

He said recently, Bruce Hales said recently that he spends the majority of his time on the matters of China and Russia. Well, I'm going to let you in on a surprising little fact. They don't think about him at all. Not even a little bit. There's not one of them that thinks, "What would Bruce Hales think?" Because they don't know who the fuck he is. Because it's 50,000 people and it's on the map.

That's my rant for today.

And it's, oh, it makes me laugh. They had us putting up signs for Harper. They were, you know, pushing so hard for that bill to not pass, and it did. Thank goodness, right? And it's just hate. They don't preach any more love or this "love and we're just simple, humble Christians." Even John Hales, right? Back in the day, I remember when he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2235s) still a leader, I was really young and hearing, you know, it's about being the simple, humble Christian, right? No big houses, no sports cars, nothing. Being humble.

And I remember being on a business meeting with my dad once and him telling this business consultant he had hired. And the consultant's like, "Oh, I know how to build your business into like a massive business." And my dad's like, "I don't even want to become a $20 million business." You know, now they're a $60 million a year business and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2266s) like, well what happened? When did the simple Christian disappear? And now it's, if you make money, then you're higher up and now we can force politics. Well, we're going to wake those politicians up. We're going to tell them about what's actually happened. They're going to hear Richard's story, Cheryl's story, Carmen's story, my story, and more people on here. And nobody wants to be friends [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2296s) people who hide pedophiles.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2299s)

Which brings us on actually to another little clip or video, which is that a Canadian podcast, in fact, the top Canadian podcaster and top independent news site in Canada called Canadaland, is producing an excellent, an excellent new podcast, which is called Ratfucker, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2331s) is basically about David Wallace, or at least it starts off being about David Wallace, and it goes on to tell parts of my story and parts of Cheryl's story, and is going to be a very, very fascinating expose of the whole PBCC.

And this video is Jesse Brown actually being interviewed by a very popular American TV channel talking about his new podcast, which is appropriately enough, I think it's being launched on Halloween.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2371s)

So this is just the last kind of few minutes as he starts talking about the PBCC. We're not going to listen to the whole thing, but we'll listen to the last few minutes of it here.

### [**Canadaland Interview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2381s)

“I'm in New York State. It goes on and on. He's just pouring this stuff out. And we keep asking, why? Why are you telling us this? You're not just implicating all of these people who are going to be pretty upset with you, but you're implicating yourself. And the reason he gave us is really where the story just opened up into a whole maze of new plot twists.

What he told us was that he had been hired through his conservative connections in Alberta, in Calgary, he had been connected to a [fundamentalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2411s) Christian sect with extensive business interests and extensive connections to politicians. And this Christian sect, they are called the Plymouth Brethren. They are functional in the UK and Australia. You can read all kinds of investigations and news stories about the Plymouth Brethren. They do have lots of connections to government. They have received millions and millions of dollars in controversial COVID contracts. And they do have a lot of political influence in circles.

And [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2442s) David Wallace told us is that they had hired him to track down a former member of their group who had left this religious group and was basically turned into a whistleblower. And that when he succeeded in finding this guy, Wallace became very suspicious about what was going to be done with this guy. And what he claims is he had essentially a crisis of conscience, that he got to the crossroads and [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2472s) increasingly suspicious that this was not your typical dirty tricks job, that this might be moving into darker territory. And he felt he might be personally implicated. He might be getting set up for liability. And he also claims that he was very concerned about what was going to happen to this ex-member of this fundamentalist Christian group.

So a lot of our work in the series is investigating those claims and saying, is it accurate that David Wallace finally found his conscience or are there other [motivations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2502s) driving him? Okay, and real quick, Klondike Papers, what are they? Well, the Klondike Papers, really, we wouldn't have pursued this or been able to confirm any of this without them. These are David Wallace's files. These are 6,400 pages of emails and text messages and metadata. And it's just astonishing to go through this and to see that the types of people he was communicating with. He was communicating with some fairly high-level political figures, not just in Canada but around the world.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2532s) it's often very difficult to get the context of what he's talking about. There's a lot of uses of aliases, but really it was this treasure trove of tips. And our job was to first of all, is this doctored? Are these documents fraudulent? Can we verify that they're real? And then if they are real, what are the stories that they tell? Now we were doing our work, which is slow, methodical work of journalism, picking specific stories. It spans years and trying to report them out, getting people to verify them.

Meanwhile, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2563s) was a rumor and word of these Klondike Papers spilled onto the internet and a hashtag \#KlondikePapers hit millions of people in Canada very quickly. A lot of people were commenting on the Klondike Papers who had never seen them or read them. And I think it's safe to say that it became something of a conspiracy theory. And people were jumping to a lot of conclusions, and making the darkest inferences and conclusions from these papers, but without really knowing whether they're true or not. 

All right, fine, you win. We got to watch or listen to it. 

It's a super interesting story. The podcasting network is Canada Land. That's where you find, of course, anywhere where there's a podcast. And this particular podcast is called Ratfucker: Confessions of a Dirty Tricks Operative. All right, Jesse Brown, thank you so much for joining us.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2617s)

Yeah, that's going to be a very, very good podcast.

I know when I did my interview with them, it was very lengthy and very in-depth.

Yeah, they were really combing through everything. It's going to be very good when it comes out. And I think it's just super important that we keep exposing this stuff over and over. And it's not that we keep rehashing stuff, it has to be exposed until accountability happens. And I sat with myself last night with the whole word accountability. What does accountability mean? Right? I mean, we could do a [whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2660s) separate podcast just on that. Because my version of accountability seems to be very different than the PBCC's.

And I think that those of us that are victims of the PBCC need to have our level of accountability and our definition of accountability vocalized over and over and over until the PBCC understand what accountability really [means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2691s). Accountability has to happen. This is, again to reiterate, it is not about retaliation. This is not about us not letting the past go. Believe me, I let that past go when I left Medicine Hat. I first lived in Maple Creek, then moved to Medicine Hat, left Medicine Hat, left that world behind me. I never kept in contact with any of you. I never kept in contact with any ex-members other than a few of them.

I rebuilt my life.

It's learning how to be responsible and to stop enabling what's happening. Because every one of us that stays quiet, that keeps this stuff stuffed and doesn't allow themselves to rehash the past because it hurts too much, you're enabling them. And I know that sounds harsh coming out of my mouth, but it truly is that. Those that keep quiet enable this power to get [larger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2748s) and larger and larger.

When I left, right? Yes, I had gone through a horrific, horrific deal, but it has grown politically and financially so strong because so many people have stayed quiet. If we can get this movement growing and we have to keep exposing the past, we have to keep exposing what's happened. Otherwise, that accountability is not going to happen. And they just keep on growing bigger and bigger and bigger. I mean, we're now dealing with [multi-billionaires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2778s) that they just dish out their money wherever it's needed. And we know we live in a world where money buys you things, right?

There's no denying that.

But at some point, if enough of us speak our truth, bring our story forward and hold them to accountability, hopefully morals overrule all the money of the world. That's what has to happen.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2814s)

A Holocaust survivor put it unforgettably. He said that all it takes for evil to prevail is for good people to keep silent.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2825s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2826s)

Yep. Yeah. I got a funny story, you know, something funny and light for the ending. I'm six, seven years old, driving home from church, middle of winter, Montreal. And my uncle Gordon McKinnon is driving in the vehicle, and we're in his truck. It's I think it was an old Ford F-150, two-wheel drive because why? Because Gord McKinnon had once [heard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2856s) I think JT Taylor or something say something about four-wheel drives were worldly, so he thought absolutely no four-wheel drives were allowed in the Brethren.

Now in front of me was my dad in a pickup truck that had four-wheel drive. And we came racing up, my dad was driving a lot faster, to a stoplight and my dad slammed on the brakes and kind of slid into the intersection a little bit, but it was clear and then he just takes off. My uncle just laughs and goes, "See, [four-wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2887s) drive doesn't help you stop." And then we tried to leave the intersection and it took us 10 minutes because the wheels were just spinning and spinning and spinning. But I remember thinking, I said, "What was wrong, what's wrong with four-wheel drive, Uncle Gordon?" And he tells me, and I remember all the way home trying to think, power goes to two wheels, Jesus is okay. Power goes to four wheels, Jesus not okay.

You know, just as a kid trying to figure out like how many wheels, why does four wheels make Jesus mad but two wheels makes him happy?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2926s)

And now they all drive Range Rovers. Yeah, exactly. Jesus turned the corner again. He turns so fast he's going in circles. It's called donuts, I think.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2944s)

Yeah.

What else should we cover today? We want people to come on, you know. Let's line up some guests and we're going to get into some stories about how it was leaving, the nights we left, you know, build up what it was like a couple days after leaving, how about that?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=2970s)

Yeah, I think it's good. I know mine was hilarious leaving. I remember me and Sarah, we left home and I had my contact solution stuffed inside my grad coat and all my clothes had been pushed out the window the night before, picked up by a cousin who was drunk and left them beside his truck and drove away so I never ever got my clothes. And yeah, you know, we spent our first night on a floor of an [apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3000s) building.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3001s)

At what, 13 years old?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3004s)

No, I was 17\. She was younger, she was 15\. Yeah, oh my goodness, yeah, I was 17\. But it was, there's just so much that leads up to that leaving, that decision and the planning that you have. And I mean, I left with like $300 thinking I was going to be able to take some time off and you're just not prepared for what happens when you meet that real world and realize, well, that $300 is not going very far because rent was $300.

But yeah, I do. I think it's important that we all get out and start telling our stories. And I just want to kind of go over some resources that we list at the end of our podcast. And so everybody can get ahold of us on info.getalife@proton.me.

We have a YouTube channel. That's Get-A-Life.

We have documentaries that are very, very important to watch. If nobody's watched the Veracity Breaking Brethren one, that's a super good one that's just been recently out. Lane had one done back in 2015, was it, called The Devil's Trap. Very, very good documentary that kind of shows what it's like when you first leave and the emotional roller coaster and the partying and, you know, that going back home and then kind of succumbing to the tracts being handed out and it [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3088s) me in tears.

There's also some really good books. There's *Behind the Exclusive Brethren* by Michael Bachelard. It's a very excellent book. And podcasts. So James DiFiore was the very kind soul who opened up the can of worms for us here in Canada. We want to very much thank him for taking the bandaid off and allowing so many of us to come forward and tell our stories. So check out his Blackballed podcast. And then there's also all the lists of all the [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3122s). If you Google on YouTube, "PBCC podcast," you'll get the list of all of the podcasts that have been done.

And it's also important, we offer the Mental Health Support Canada helpline there for anyone that's struggling to make sure you reach out.

And hopefully we can see some of you on here and start this movement going via this podcast and maybe get some healing in another layer. That's our hope.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3152s)

Anything else you guys want to add? If your healing involves rock and roll, then rock on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3164s)

Okay, well I think that ends it for today and we will catch you guys next time. Take care everyone.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQj2ABL50kU&t=3171s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
