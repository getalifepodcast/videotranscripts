## Summary

How do you pick yourself up when you lose the family you love? Stephen Gear had to do just that when the left the control of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC) in order to preserve his mental well-being. Many who have left this group will empathise with the deep sadness having to make that choice brings. Stephen shares how he found kindness outside the brethren when he needed it most. He describes how he tried to return to the brethren and was prevented from doing so by one person. Did that person have an ulterior motive for keeping Stephen from the family he loved?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3s)

Good evening everybody. Welcome to the Get A Life podcast here in the UK. I'm here with my friends Anne and Ross and Gilli and our special guest with us here today is Stephen. Good evening Stephen.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=21s)

Good evening. How are you doing? Yeah I'm good thank you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=24s)

I'm good. Okay, so Stephen, you left the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church about 13 years ago, is that correct?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=34s)

That's right, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=35s)

So maybe we just start at the very beginning and you tell us why you left and what happened and a little bit about your story.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=43s)

Well, I don't think we've got time tonight. Yeah I, I actually struggled with it even as a teenager really. When I was 16 I asked, I didn't ask my father, I said to him on the way back from the meeting one evening when we were all together as a family in the car and I said um, I really, I'm sorry to say it but I really don't think it's for me. I don't really have that much interest in the religious side of things. And my dad scared me into staying and he looked in the rearview mirror and he leaned forward and he said if you leave you may never return.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=91s)

Wow and you were 16 at that point.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=96s)

Yeah and how, how right was. When I did leave I'll never go back.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=104s)

How did that make you feel at 16 years old? That's quite strong isn't it?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=110s)

Yeah I mean I was frightened to death and it was a bit ridiculous of me to even consider leaving at 16 when I didn't really have anything behind me and certainly no experience to be able to leave you know there was nothing for me on the outside world and and so I stayed and thought I can, I can do this and but clearly I couldn't.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=140s)

Yeah, yeah. So presumably you're still at school at that point. 	

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=145s)

Yeah, yeah I was yeah. And latterly it was probably two years before I finally left that I was really struggling with life inside as it were and obviously I was married then with two lovely children and I never left for the bright lights of the outside world. I left because I couldn't cope with life inside and [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=180s) you know, I still say to this day if somebody had said to me on the 8th of February 2010, tomorrow you're going to leave and you're never going to go back, I would have said that's absolutely ridiculous. There's no way I can't leave because I knew what would happen. And then, unfortunately, you know, I've been struggling for two years and speaking quite openly about how...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=217s)

So we just lost a bit of the vocals there. You got to the point you say you were speaking quite openly about how and then I think it froze.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=225s)

Yeah I was speaking quite openly in the religion about how I wasn't coping very well and so I was considered a high-risk leaver for quite some time before I eventually left even though I was not thinking of leaving at all. I, you know it wasn't an option really for me. Um and then we went through the whole process or went through the whole process of them sending me to a psychiatrist saying that they thought that I was bipolar and I should go and get checked up. And I said, I don't think I'm bipolar, but thanks anyway. And they said, no, you really need to go. We're going to send you to Dr. Blacker at the Priory in Bristol.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=276s)

That was the same. Yeah, that you saw, wasn't it, Ross? Yeah. How did you get on with Dr. Blacker?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=283s)

Well, there's a story that I've never told.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=286s)

Go on, then.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=290s)

I went, I said to them before, I said look if you really want me to go I'll go but I really don't think I have bipolar and it turned out I didn't actually. And Dr Blacker actually wrote in his report and I read it but I didn't keep it unfortunately. It said I can, at the end of the report there was loads of writing and it said at the end I can categorically state that Stephen is sane. I guess not many people get that accreditation, do they?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=325s)

I can't believe you threw that accreditation away, it could come in useful.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=331s)

I didn't throw it away, I was never given it to keep. I was allowed to read it and it said something about ,while Stephen has a lot of material, I can categorically state Stephen is sane. And I had two one-hour sessions with him about a week apart and I went into the first session thinking yeah I got this I'm just going to be honest and within minutes my brain was fried and he was asking me [thousands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=361s) of questions jumping along my timeline of my life from when I was a little child to what happened last week to what happened when I was 12 and then 18 and then back to three again and then up to two months ago whatever and I can, I mean that's why they do it I guess, that I was completely fried and I was just saying I didn't even know what I was saying by the end it was just all coming out and uh bearing in mind that this guy was being paid [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=392s) huge amount of money to almost exclusively see brethren patients all day every single day I think it was £500 an hour.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=402s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=404s)

Yeah and he'd been doing that for several years by the time I went. So considering what was on the line with him by the end of the second session and he was dressed all in a white suit and he was quite old and frail he jumped up at the end of the second hour session and strode across the room, opened the door with a flourish and said, Stephen, you're free to leave. And my brain was just in a fog. I couldn't even really realise what was going on. I just heard him say it and I turned round and I went, oh, great. And I got up and literally kind of stumbled across his office and slouched out past him, stood there at the door. And he was, I'll never forget it. He was stood there with his hand on top of the door like that and there was this long corridor leading from [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=458s) door and as I walked down the long corridor I was just in an absolute daze and somewhere out of the fog I heard “Steven, Steven, Steven.” and I stopped and I turned around and realized it was him calling me, and I turned around and I said “What?” and he looked at me nodded his head and he said you've got to leave the brethren.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=486s)

Wow that's exactly what he said to me.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=491s)

Really? Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=492s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=492s)

And I just and I just looked at him and I just said, I can't, I can't. And I stumbled off and went downstairs to where my sister was going to pick me up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=503s)

So just to put this into context for people who don't perhaps, you know, outside the Brethren who listen to this, at this point you were married with two children and presumably your livelihood was dependent on the Brethren?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=515s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=516s)

Yeah, and your housing or was that independent of the Brethren?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=521s)

Well no, my house was, I bought my house when I was 21 but I had to put my wife on the mortgage when we got married.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=527s)

Yeah, so it was jointly owned by you. So the consequences, the thought of leaving the Brethren is basically that you would lose your wife, your children, your extended family. That's what you knew would happen if you left. That's presumably...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=541s)

It was a lot more than that. I would lose my wife, my children, my family, all of my friends, everyone that I knew because you're not going to be in contact with people outside other than for business, and my house, and my cars, and my job. Everything, the world as I knew it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=560s)

Yeah, would come crumbling. And how old were you at this point?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=564s)

32 at the point of going to Dr Blacker and 33 when I left a few months later, I think it was about five months later. Yeah. And yeah, it was horrendous and things got worse and worse. And when they couldn't pin bipolar on me, they said to me, we think you've got a real problem. You need to go on antidepressants.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=587s)

So when you say they is that the brethren elders or is it your family or who is the...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=594s)

Yeah the the priests the elders the...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=597s)

Priests, the elders okay who would be visiting you to try and help you and I put help.. yeah okay.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=604s)

And so um again I said to them, I don't think I've got a problem I just think that I'm deeply unhappy. And they said you need to go on antidepressants and if you don't accept that you need to go on antidepressants you've got a much bigger problem than what we thought you had.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=626s)

So just to pause it there these priests had no medical training whatsoever they had no training in psychology or diagnosing disease.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=635s)

I'm not so sure about that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=637s)

Right…

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=639s)

 I think they've all got very, very good training in psychology.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=642s)

Well, maybe they have, but not the traditional training in psychology, a very unique training. I think you could be right there, Stephen. And then they are suggesting that what's going to sort you out is antidepressants?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=655s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=656s)

And how common do you think that is in the Brethren? I don't know. I think you'd have some experience with this, wouldn't you?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=663s)

Well, I don't know. I don't know how many people were forced to take antidepressants like I was, but I know that a lot of them were on them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=673s)

Yeah, many of us were on them because like you, we didn't think we had an option to leave and we were trying to cope somehow.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=685s)

Yeah, but I didn't even want the antidepressants. And I said to them, I said, I don't want to go on antidepressants because I've heard it's really difficult to get off of them. Um but if you're telling me that's what I've got to do and there's going to be a problem if I don't then I guess I'll have to be submissive and go on the antidepressants. And so not only did they put me on antidepressants but they told, I was going to say [forced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=715s) but they didn't, well I don't know if or not but they told my wife she had to physically give me the tablets every day and stand there in front of me to watch to make sure that I took them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=728s)

So how did they get hold of the antidepressants or did they send you to the doctor? I mean this is actually quite worrying because it's an aspect I hadn't heard of before so so they actually gave you the antidepressants.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=743s)

Well my wife got them somehow and after taking them for I don't recall a period of time maybe a month, they said that I obviously still wasn't happy and they said that well you just need to you only started on a very low dose you should increase the dose. And when that day came it was very shortly after that they told me I had to increase the dose and I knew what was what the end goal was going to be and that I was just going to end up a cabbage. 

I would either, I would either end up in an asylum or dead,  because I, I hated my life in the religion and I couldn't cope. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=804s) was literally down to you know minute by minute hour by hour just just trying to breathe and get through hating my life, loving my kids and my wife of course but um and on that day I don't know what happened, like I said, the day before if somebody had asked me I'd have said no way would I leave or could I leave or did I want to leave. 

And then the next day somebody got married, Laura Freeman got [married](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=834s), and I came home, I can't remember if it was a morning wedding anyway it was an unusual day so there wasn't really, it wasn't church in the evening and I came home and I was just driving round around Gloucester. I just didn't want to go home and I think subconsciously it started to dawn on me, and by the time I, and then I rang Fred who was the 67 year old bloke that used to work [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=864s) my uncle that I got on really well and still stayed in touch with.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=867s)

And he's non-brethren just to, he was outside yeah yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=872s)

He's never been anything to do the brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=874s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=874s)

I rang him and I just said Fred it's over I just can't do this anymore. And I said I'm still in my work clothes and he said go home and get changed and come around and either talk about it or don't talk about it is entirely up to you. And so I did go home and it must have been quite late by this time because the kids were already in bed and my wife was in the kitchen downstairs and I went upstairs and got changed and I can't even, can't imagine what state my brain was in when I got a Tesco carrier bag and put three pairs of boxers and three pairs of socks and one t-shirt in it as if as if that was gonna help me and I knotted the top, opened the window and threw it out onto the front lawn and then I went into the ensuite and leant my head against the mirror and I remember [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=942s) I used to get searing pains across here like somebody had put a cheese wire into my head, the pain was incredibly intense and I realized then, and really only then, that this was it. 

It was the end of the line as you may say. And I found myself climbing through and sitting [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=972s) the edge of the window and the cool breeze in my face. And I never forget thinking this is what suicide feels like because I was departing one life and going into another, but I never hesitated or thought about it and I didn't walk through the front door because I couldn't without causing a massive drama. Because as soon as she had heard the front door, the door handle, because remember everyone was on high alert for a long period of time before I finally left at least a year and any time the door handle went she would have shot straight through and grabbed my arm and said where are you going? What are you doing? and [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1024s) I said I'm this is it I'm leaving there would have been lots of tears and I'm sure there were tears afterwards as well but um I just didn't, I wasn't doing it for attention, I wasn't doing it to try to make somebody feel sorry for me I just wanted to go quietly without any fuss you know.

The cry for help had I'd been telling anyone that wanted to listen for the past two years and nobody really [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1054s) don't know whether they really understood or whether they cared or what happened but I didn't get the help that I needed and I jumped out the window and got in one of the cars and drove around to see Fred and never went back.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1068s)

Wow and dare I ask what happened they found you'd gone.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1076s)

I have no idea. No no I have never… 

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1081s)

You've never gone back you've never never.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1084s)

Oh I tried, I tried um because uh they did allow me, obviously they're trying to get hold of me and I just turned my phones off and everything and I just didn't want to know um and it was maybe a couple of weeks, I literally can't remember um eventually I was in contact with them and they allowed me to go back the house and to see the children a few times and I hoped that was how it was going to be and I remember [playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1120s) with the Scalectrics with the children and my wife was crying and I thought well what why can't we do this, I love, and I said to my wife I said I didn't leave the religion… sorry I didn't leave you I left the religion.

And that's why I'm still single today because I still love her. Nobody will ever replace her. And obviously it kills me every day not being able to see my kids. But I was very naive in thinking that this could continue ,that I could see the kids and play Skalectrics with them and take them to the park and live a separate life.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1173s)

I think we do think that, don't we? And there's that hope in us. And if they give us any little olive branch, we hang on to it thinking this is going to be okay, it's going to be okay. And then they just drop you again, you know. And I think it's, yeah, it's all a ploy to try and get us to go back.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1192s)

Absolutely and and I would have I would have stayed I would have even, I would have continued to live in that house with them with as long as I didn't have to do anything to do with the religion.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1208s)

This is where as I know it's been said before the manner in which they practice separation is so wrong and you know we get accused of being against the brethren against their principles of separation I don't think any of us are of us particularly are we probably all attempt to keep separate from evil but what happens is the bottom line is because one member of the family decide that that church is not for them for whatever reason the family mustn't know them and that's the bottom line [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1238s) harm we're trying to address isn't it? You know they talk about being a mainstream church if one member of the family goes to Church of England and the rest the family don't, the family doesn't fall apart they live as a family, they respect that that one member goes to church and maybe the other partner doesn't and it's that that they're missing isn't it? It's that harm they're causing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1257s)

And I find that it's sort of ironic because the whole reason that we're doing what we're doing is for that very reason and just that reason. The more we seem to highlight that the more they seem to turn against us you know it's just they don't get it that it's that.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1276s)

Yeah yeah and then I think they let me see the children like three times or something and I was quite upbeat you know this is this is cool this is really lovely I'm still getting to see my kids and maybe something can be worked out and then of course all of a sudden out of nowhere they said the kids don't want to see you anymore.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1303s)

Yeah and how how old were your children at that time?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1308s)

Ten and eight.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1309s)

So ten and eight year olds have the ability to understand they don't want to see their daddy. I'm sorry they don't do they? They don't, they haven't got the emotional maturity to know what's going on bless them.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1321s)

Well maybe they do when they've been told so many bad things about me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1326s)

Yes that's exactly the point.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1329s)

I will never know what they were, I will never know what they were told about me but and one thing’s for sure I didn't leave for the bright lights of this world. I was scared stiff about what was out here. I just left because I knew that I wasn't going to survive in there or I would end up in an asylum which is neither of those options are helpful to my children either.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1360s)

I think you're probably echoing what a lot of ex-members feel that the bottom line was you left because if not your mental health would have deteriorated to such a state that you don't know what you would have done and I don't think you're alone in saying that I know I'm sure you felt like that at times Anne and Gilli you were quite frank about how you felt at times and um lost as well and I think it is.. so that's the bottom line it's that choice between [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1391s) on with it or literally spiraling into a mental abyss as you say you don't know where you'd end up.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1397s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1399s)

But at that point when you're at that point of leaving you do almost feel a bit crazy don't you.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1405s)

My,  listen my mental health was in absolute shreds yeah what can you imagine why would I put three pairs of boxers and three pairs of socks and one t-shirt in a Tesco bag my brain my brain was just not functioning.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1422s)

Yeah yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1424s)

Can I ask Stephen was the conversation ever had with your wife about whether you'd leave as a family or…

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1434s)

Never. I never ever asked her to leave and I never tried to influence her to leave because I knew that she wouldn't be able to survive in the outside world. We were shut up in 2006 for 10 or 12 weeks and she was just in bits every day missing her dad and mum.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1464s)

Yeah yeah that's tough.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1466s)

And then a year after I left and this is the bit the children probably don't know well I'm sure they don't, a year after I left my I was really struggling in the outside world and I was not integrating with society well at all.

I really couldn't cope and it it definitely wasn't ever from a financial situation um I just couldn't cope with the whole the way that the world was and the way that people were and I think I probably ran into some not very nice people and that kind of thing um I mean I wasn't [keeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1509s) company with bad people it was just my experience of the people that I met through other people I guess.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1517s)

Yeah and also when you first leave you're very trusting of everybody as well aren't you because you're taught to you know you live in a sphere where everybody everybody knows each other and therefore you you know trust everybody so you tend to take that into the outside world when you first leave. Yeah, that's what I've learned.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1541s)

Yeah, very true.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1543s)

The upbringing we all had, it leaves you, it doesn't equip you for just a basic knowledge of people in life. So when you do leave, it's not a case of getting in with wrong people or right people or good people or bad people. You don't have that knowledge of how people can be because the only community you've ever mixed with people have all been the same or have been tried to be the same haven't they so you don't have that diversity of different characters and that's what can make you feel so at sea [isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1573s) it? You don't know quite how to handle this influx of um that's hitting you.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1578s)

Yeah and like Ross said not only um trustworthy or trusting people but also completely naive.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1587s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1589s)

Unbelievable. Looking back on how naive I was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1592s)

I think we all cringe at that one.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1598s)

Yeah. Sorry, you're going to say, Stephen, a year after you left.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1602s)

Yes. So, yeah. So a year after I left, I wasn't coping with life out here. And I did something that basically, I wanted to go back, and I said that I wanted to go back and I can't remember what I did. I posted something on Facebook because I wanted to do something that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1633s) outside world would see, that they knew that I'd gone back and that I couldn't reverse it. So I couldn't go back into the world, if that makes sense.

So I had to continue that journey to get back in because I was so worried about being able to do this cat and mouse journey of them playing with you psychologically, and all the hoops you have to jump through and being held in [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1663s) vacuum for an unknown period of time where you're not allowed to live in the outside world, you have to live in a house somewhere that they put you in and basically just do your job and stay at home on your own for an unknown period of time. 

And sometimes that can run into two or three years and I knew that I wasn't strong enough to be able to do that and I would just be a mess and I'll be back in exactly the same, [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1693s) in square one, basically same place where it started and so I posted this on Facebook to basically shut down my life in the outside world and I drove to Gloucester and knocked on the door of my parents house and my dad came to the door and could see that it was me through the frosted glass and he wouldn't open the door. 

And I said I said please just let me in, just let me come and stay with you I'm done with this world and he, well [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1723s) wasn't actually him, it was my mother screaming from the background “You need to get clear of your sins.” She was screaming at the top of her voice like a  banshee and it was it was a terrible time. Anyway they wouldn't let me in and then my mum screamed through the window that “I've called the police and I've called the… and I've called the priests.” 

And as soon as she said that I knew that probably the priests would turn up before the police and they would [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1754s) doubt push my buttons and I haven't had a fight since I was 16 years old with my brother. I'm the least aggressive person in the world and yet I knew that they would push me over the edge and I'd probably end up hitting them which is what they want me to do so that I'm then in a big ton of trouble. 

So I jumped in my car and left and and then I was back in touch with the priests and I don't want to name his name so I'm not sure how I can carry on to telling [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1784s) story. Anyway one one of my priests in particular I was in more contact with like on the phone and that kind of thing and three times over the period of several months, three times I tried really hard to go back and every time I went back or tried to go back um he kept on blocking me and basically ridiculing me and it was never when anyone else was there or listening.

And they got me [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1814s) go to one of their premises and I sat there for three and a half hours and told them every little sin I've done since I was born and some of the stuff which I'd never said and I was crying my eyes out for three and a half hours, and then a couple of weeks later I was on the phone to this one priest, and he said to me the problem with you Steven is you don't go deep enough, you read your sins like a shopping list. And I said what are you talking about I was crying my eyes out as a grown man for three and a half hours, telling, going over every single little thing I'd ever done wrong and now you're saying I read them out like a shopping list? What do you want from me? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1868s) they said we have to smash your own will into a million pieces so that you never ever ever do what you want to do ever again.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1883s)

I'm speechless yeah and that's I just...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1891s)

And so I mean I was I I I pretty much gave up for I can't remember a couple of weeks or a couple of months and then I got back in touch with him again and said look I really want to I really do want to come back I'm missing my kids so much um please just tell me what I need to do and I'll do it and I was on the phone to this same priest so I won't mention his name and he laughed at me [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1921s) the phone he literally... you don't want to come back. And I said, and I quote, word for word, because I remember it like it was five minutes ago. I said his name and then I said, I want nothing more than to be back among the brethren. And he laughed at me again and said, you don't want to come back. And it was seven years later that I found out why.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1957s)

Ah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1958s)

His son married my ex-wife.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1964s)

I just, I don't know how you take that Stephen, I really don't. You think that was the design all along?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=1974s)

Well, my ex-wife's youngest sister also left the Brethren about seven years later and she contacted me and said I'd really like to meet you for a coffee I've got some things I think you need to hear and she sat me down and said ever since practically the day you left his son was courting the affections of my sister, your ex[\-wife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2004s) and that same priest, my ex-wife's now father-in-law even came to the courtroom to see my divorce go through to make sure it went through. He was sat at the back of the court and in court I stood up and I said; “Your honor I do not want to get divorced, reconciliation is the only thing on my mind and in my heart.” And the judge said “ I'm sorry Mr Gear it's far too late for that.” And he was sat at the back of the court watching it go through and get it rubber stumped.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2050s)

So this is probably a really silly question but I want the answer how do you cope with that how does that make you feel.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2058s)

Chuck it in the box and throw away the key.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2062s)

Yeah yeah you don't want to open that box too often do you no no. I mean that is you know that I think the point about that it's this this is happening in somewhere that is professed to be a caring compassionate Christian community and it's not. What happened is bad enough Stephen it happened I'm not belittling it by saying it happens this thing things can happen in life yeah that are pretty bad but when it [happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2092s) in a community that wants that external portrayal of being a caring compassionate community and yet underneath they're carrying on like anybody else in this world they're taught to hate aren't they and it's that that you...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2106s)

Yes but you know I I do actually still believe 99.9 percent of the members of the brethren are really decent people but...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2119s)

I don't disagree yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2121s)

But unfortunately, the few people that are in power are an absolute nightmare. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2130s)

And not being made to be accountable in any shape or form. I think that's the, you know, they, as you say, you mentioned this priest who obviously seemed to have ulterior designs on what he was doing with your life in such a devastating way. Accountable to nobody, I assume. Nobody was checking on him.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2150s)

Well I did, I did hear that he actually got a priestly visit himself because of the amount of time and attention he was giving my ex-wife.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2162s)

Now this is getting even darker, I mean it's just devastating though isn't it? We laugh but it's not funny it's devastating absolutely devastating um and then so that's sort of uh seven years after you left that happened.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2184s)

Yeah and weirdly enough, weirdly enough um whenever I bump into any brethren at exhibitions for business which I do quite often in my industry and most of them look at me like with a fleeting glance of absolute horror as if I'm a murderer, and for years and years and years up until probably about a year ago [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2215s) I would, I'm constantly scanning the pavements when I'm in public for brethren without realizing it so that I can avoid them because I don't want to be looked at like I'm a the plague.

And every single time any of them actually went out of their way to speak to me, which was quite a bit risky on their part and they would always do the whole patronizing oh you know, there's always time, they would always play the card of superiority, of like it’s such a shame you know, you could be in a much better place than this… [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2264s) it only occurred to me a year ago. I'm actually not gonna be.

 I can't remember whether I was scared or ashamed of the situation or I just didn't like being treated like a piece of stuff on the floor.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2281s)

But...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2282s)

And I thought I'm not I'm no longer going to allow them to speak to me in this way and if they do want to come up and speak to me I'm gonna absolutely, and I've done this several times and it is great therapy, and if they make the transition to come into my personal space to talk to me, you know within about three steps away you know that they're going to come to talk to you and as soon as [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2312s) do before they start speaking I always, I'm always polite and and nice to them, but I always say to them really nice to see you, I feel so sorry for you guys trapped in there. If only you knew what it was like, if the tables were turned you would never stay. Yeah yeah and they're in shock horror they're like what are you bitter? No I'm not, I'm not in the slightest bit bitter.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2345s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2346s)

You know I'm not angry if anybody should be bitter against the brethren it should be me having my wife and children taken away from me preventing, preventing me not not twice but three times preventing me from going back just so that his son could marry my ex-wife is absolutely horrendous um but I'm not bitter against the brethren um that [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2376s) it's it's much more fun to turn the tables and feel sorry for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2380s)

Yeah and I think that's a really key point actually. I think when you leave we all know that those of us have left have a stigma attached to us and we all know that nothing good about us will be said amongst the brethren which is really hurtful when it's to your children and so on. It's being said but doing what you've done it empowers you. It takes that control away from them doesn't it? It's saying you know I'm okay and actually yeah I don't like the way you behave towards me but I'm okay [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2410s) doing okay and my mental health is sure better yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2414s)

Yeah it's interesting I mean my mental health I've never taken antidepressants since the day that I left them and my mental health is the strongest it's ever been and I'm in a really good place in life and somebody said to me that you're so lucky you know you've got a great business and you're doing great and you've such a, you go to all these amazing places do this amazing stuff and you're here there and everywhere you have an amazing life [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2446s) I looked at them and they were very very close friends so you know I felt like I could and I said but I will never be happy.

And they sort of laughed and said oh much what’s more? And I said no it's not about that at all while my kids are prevented or while I'm prevented from seeing my children I can never be happy not truly happy and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2477s) not it wasn't, I wasn't talking about anything to do with materialistic things which of course they were and and I think that sort of made them sit up and and realize really that you know, it's not all about money and life, which I'm very fortunate to enjoy a nice life, but it's not that, my children mean so much more to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2501s)

Yeah you would empathise with that Anne wouldn't you?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2503s)

Yeah I was just gonna say that somebody said tha,t I thought was good, that it's a deep sadness that we carry with us but it doesn't mean that we're not happy in our lives, but we just carry that that'll never go away. You know that isn't, you don't move on from the loss of your children, your loved ones you don't, but you learn to live with it don't you…

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2532s)

Exactly exactly.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2533s)

…sadness that...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2534s)

Yeah that is you're absolutely spot on that's exactly what it is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2538s)

Yeah it's that expression isn't it one of the hardest things to grieve is to grieve someone who's actually still alive yeah. Yeah yeah because in theory they could be in your life there's no, the the barriers for them not being… and not the fact they've passed away are they, they're there, they're alive there.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2556s)

Yeah yeah yeah go on.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2560s)

Sorry I do always try and turn that around to say well where there's life there is hope yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2566s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2566s)

Um yeah you know  I never give up hope. Never give up.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2570s)

You see, you see, I can't, I can't and haven't allowed myself to hope I cannot, I cannot live my life every day thinking oh they didn't leave today they might leave tomorrow it would just eat me alive.

I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm never gonna see them again but obviously I do hope underneath.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2597s)

Yeah yeah I mean I don't, yeah I don't think about it every day or anything but I just have this this hope within me yeah that that like, that I just yeah one day… I mean if it doesn't happen it might be my grandchildren, it might be my great grandchildren I don't know but there's just always that that bit of hope in me. I think, I suppose we're all different how we cope with that aren't we, and that is something that that keeps me going.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2626s)

It's an interesting yeah it's an interesting one because like like you said you carry it for forever for our entire lives um but time is a great healer and I'm not suggesting that the thoughts of my children will ever be healed until if they ever do leave.

But only just recently and literally in the last three or four months I found myself daydreaming [while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2656s) I'm driving or something and just thinking, imagine if I suddenly got a phone call and my son or my daughter said that they'd left, wherever I was in the world I would drop what I had or what I was doing and I would get on a plane or get in a car and get to them as quickly as I could. And imagine the afterwards… Imagine them coming to work for me in my business and living with me or [near](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2686s) me. It would just be, you know, it's only in the last three months I've started to allow myself these thoughts, which I never have done before.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2696s)

So in the 13 years that you've left, you said you saw your children two or three times in those early days.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2704s)

Yeah, that was in the first few months.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2706s)

Yeah have you had any contact whatsoever or any...

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2712s)

Nothing no so and yeah I'm not too sure how much to say but and last year I decided that I wanted to send them a substantial amount of money and and I contacted my brother by email and I said I would like to send my children some money and I didn't say how much I was going to send them and I said it's a substantial amount of money um and it I'm not talking [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2749s) £100 um and I also put in my email also I will not accept sending the money to a third-party account. I will only send it to their bank account in their name. 

And I waited probably two weeks without any reply because obviously it had to go all the way up to the top and then come all the way back down again and after about two weeks I got an email back and it didn't say, “Hello Steven,” it didn't even say “Steven” at the top. The only thing the email said was please see below bank account details as requested the name, sort code, account number for both my children [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2795s) there was no sign off at the bottom.

It was as cold as you possibly could be and so I  went to send them some money and obviously like most people got the banking app on my phone so I went into the banking app because I was I was out, I wasn't at home I can't remember where I was but I went into the app and put in their new new payee details [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2826s) went to send them the money, and it wouldn't let me send it through the app because it was too much, and it said you've exceeded your daily allowance and the daily allowance was £1,000.

And so I thought I'm gonna have to wait until I get home and then go on my laptop and do it through my laptop, and then I suddenly had a genius idea.

I'm gonna send them £500 each for weeks. I had 19 letters or spaces as the reference for the payment and I was putting my email address in there, I was writing little messages that led on to the next day that led on to the next day.

 I haven't I have no idea where they live, no phone contact details, no email contact details, no way of getting in touch with them but this was my only little connection [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2887s) I could make through these 19 letters on the payments and I only sent the payments Monday to Friday and this went on for weeks, and they must have thought is this ever gonna end?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2898s)

Yeah yeah did you ever get an acknowledgement of the gift you've given them.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2905s)

No never no.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2907s)

No yeah it's tough my children I tried to give my children some when I sold the house but they wouldn't even accept it.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2915s)

Why do you think that was?I mean it's not... They love money\!

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2922s)

I was just going to say... I'm so.. thought my money was unclean.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2928s)

It wasn't pure.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2930s)

Yeah, the money is for God, isn't it? 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2933s)

So, you would havethought... Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, that's incredible. They wouldn't even accept it. Yeah. Yeah. So, after you left the Brethren, just to backtrack slightly um did you at that point lose your work because most people as we know work for the brethren and as Gilli explained and Ross explained when they left they lost their work what happened to you from a work front?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2957s)

I absolutely have no recollection I know that I stayed with Fred for three days and three nights and then he said obviously and I always felt compelled this is going to make me sound bad so maybe I shouldn't say that, but I always felt compelled when telling the story to make sure people knew that Fred had a wife, just in case they thought that I was gay which I'm obviously I'm not and uh...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2985s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2987s)

was coming coming from such a homophobic background um that was and I'm not...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2992s)

Understand that.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=2993s)

Yeah I'm I'm not homophobic anymore but and I'm still very straight let's say that anyway and so yeah, the three days I was with Fred and his wife and I was sleeping on the sofa and eventually, they only got a one-bed council flat and he said, “I'm sorry we can't put you up forever you know you're gonna need to move off.” And then I went on the website and I hit [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3023s) emergency red button in the right hand top corner that used to be and then I think...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3030s)

Is that the Wikipeebia one or Peebs.net?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3034s)

Peebs.net I think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3035s)

So the precursor to Wikipeebia, yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3038s)

Yeah and so then I went I don't know whether I went straight but I went to stay with a couple that used to be brethren, uh Ghinns... um Mark and Deb is it yeah yeah yeah and uh they looked after me really really well um and I stayed there for two weeks and after that I, the whole that whole period of time is such a black hole I can't really remember what happened, um I just kind of existed really and somehow survived and I'm here to tell the tale.

But um yeah [eventually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3085s) I then went into business with, it was a very bad bad decision but the only the only option I had really went into business with a guy that I used to buy second-hand cars from when I was in the brethren and actually he used to supply quite a lot of brethren with their vehicles. 

And  we started a business together 50/50 he put the money in and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3115s) did all the work which was what we agreed and after five years we were um making a lot of money and sadly he decided that he wanted to keep it all for himself so he kicked me out of the business and I lost everything in 2015 again for the second time in my life, and then I [moved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3147s) to Spain for some sunshine and happiness.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3150s)

Yeah I remember that yeah yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3154s)

Again because because of my mental health at that time in 2015 like I couldn't really see a way back from losing absolutely everything for a second time only five years later and I was devastated, and I knew it was cheap in Spain and I was kind of scrambling around, still in the still in the hygiene industry um [scrambling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3185s) around being a bit part consultant and trying to, well designing various products for various companies and they paid me for 11 months that I was in Spain. 

Yeah. Um and and I lived like a king because you don't need to earn much to have a good living. And then one of my ex-competitors from the first business that I got kicked out of, he was a competitor of mine, again, never anything to do with the brethren, he contacted me and said, I haven't heard from you in a long time. Where are you and what are you doing? And I said, I'm not in the industry anymore, the hygiene industry. I said, I've left and I'm living in Spain. And actually I was working on a campsite in Spain as an entertainment manager organizing all the shows.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3241s)

Right.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3243s)

And I was also playing in two bands while I was in Spain one rock and roll band I played keyboard in, and an acoustic band I played guitar and so he said to me well I've got some money to invest, what do you think about starting a business together and I thought here we go again. Yeah same thing all over again but I took the offer because it was a better situation than what I was in at that time and I thought do you know what, again he's going to put the money in I'm going to do the work and at least this time I'm going to go into this expecting to lose everything.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3291s)

And actually I don't care because my the money that we'd agreed I was going to draw out of the business from day one was considerably more than what I was being paid on the campsite.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3305s)

So...so you had a living....

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3307s)

Yeah so I had a living and I thought actually do you know what even if this all goes pear-shaped again because I'm bound to get taken advantage of again, I'm bound to lose everything all over again and history is going to um repeat itself, at least I'll go into this expecting that to happen and not have anything to lose in that respect, you know what I mean. And uh...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3331s)

Is that the business you work in now?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3334s)

It's the business that I own 100% now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3338s)

Oh wow fantastic fantastic that's brilliant yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3343s)

Yeah and that second business partner was absolutely amazing and w we never argued we were in business together for four years so it's just to me just coming up five years I've had the business now and um uh I bought him out a year ago.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3362s)

Wow.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3363s)

Yeah I've owned the company 100% for almost a year now and it is unbelievable. You know every day I wake up and I just can't believe, I mean you know we've done quite well for ourselves I suppose you could say, and we've we've had some we have had some good times and uh made some decent money and he was very happy because the original investment that he put into the business was a lot, it was a lot more [than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3393s) the first guy put into the first business and and during the four years we were together we actually paid him back all of his money and four times his original investment.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3408s)

Wow fantastic.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3410s)

And obviously the the other three the other three times we were both taking dividends because we were both 50/50 in the business and so the other three multiples of his original investment I was also getting as my, as my dividend so it was uh finding myself in a situation financially that I've never been in my life and...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3430s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3430s)

Amazing and um I'm actually going to China with him in two weeks time.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3437s)

Oh wow.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3438s)

Fantastic.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3439s)

We're not going to the same factories because he's still in the hygiene industry but he has his other business in hand dryers um yeah and I'm going to see my factories and he's to see his factories but we're gonna you know, meet up and go for dinner and um we're going there together and we're coming home together and we still go for beers you know once a month or once every six weeks and it's amazing that good people do exist out here, yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3466s)

They do and that's exactly what I was going to say about that that that story you've just recounted so often we know people in are told there's nothing out here it's you know it you'll never make it and I think actually what you've told us is an absolute testament that you can hit rock bottom but you can go back up and I think that's a big message to get across isn't it? I mean you know we've all been yeah we've all been there.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3494s)

Rock bottom twice, rock bottom twice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3497s)

Yeah yeah and I think that's something that comes out in a lot of people's stories that they're now telling on these podcasts is they've got to that absolute low point, real you know beyond low but they're here telling their story and they've turned it round and that can happen to anybody.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3516s)

Yeah I've had some I've had some really bizarre things happen to me well in the last 13 years. I don't know what why they keep happening to me but for instance when I got kicked out of the business the second time around, um just before I got kicked out and there's no need for me to go into the whys and how he [legally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3547s) managed to manipulate the situation and he legally was allowed to kick me out by something he had hidden in the annual accounts that I didn't pick up on, um anyway I knew something wasn't right about three or four months before he kicked me out and and I just could tell something was wrong. We're making all this money and we were doing so well and I was so happy [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3577s) there was just something that gut feeling I knew something wasn't right so I went to Janine Wiltshire's, one of her house parties that she used to have. 

And while I was there one time, she'd invited her new next door neighbours. And that was a guy called Owen Rothwell. Again, they're nothing to do with the brethren. So Owen and Sarah Rothwell were at the party because they lived next door to Janine. And I was chatting to Owen and I immediately hit it off with him. And just got on so well with him and saw them pretty much every time I went to one of these parties at Janine's and it was only by the like [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3623s) time I'd met him or something I just had formed such a good friendship with him that I felt able to express to him about my concerns about my business partner and he said to me, well it definitely sounds like you need some help but I’m not the person to do it. Let me talk to my best friend and Tim Kearns who is also my boss at H.R. Owen, the largest Ferrari dealership in the [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3653s).

And then Owen rang me a few days later and said, oh I spoke with him and Tim said for you to come and pop in to see him at the Knightsbridge Ferrari garage.

Really kind of you but wharton  earth would he be interested in what's going on in my world? Oh don't worry it's not it's not like that it's not [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3683s) that just go and see him he's a really nice guy.

So I did and I sat there in his office in Ferrari garage in Knightsbridge for three hours or two and half hours and uh told him everything and at the end he said;

“ It's a fascinating story Stephen, I think that you're right to worry. From what you said I think your business partner is definitely up to no good” and he said “...but I think you need more of a numbers man [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3713s) I'm not a numbers man um but I do know a guy that is.” I'm just thinking it's ridiculous so he says, “I'm having a beer tomorrow night with Adrian Martin he's our our financial director and sits on the board.” I'm like come on this is absolutely ridiculous why is he going to be bothered about me and he went, “No it's not like that it's not like that.”  and three days later I get a call Adrian Martin wants to meet you. So what are you doing this weekend? I said no nothing happy to meet and they said, Owen said to me, “Tim wants you to go to the uh Ferrari track day at Silverstone because Adrian Martin's going to be there.”  so I get to the track day get led up and I've got a parking space reserved for me and all this and I'm totally out of my depth here and I get led up to the VIP, go through VIP out onto the balcony that overlooks the start finish line of the [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3774s) the racetrack and there at the end of the balcony is Adrian Martin and his wife, and he, I don't know how old he is probably late 60s now he would be early 70s and he looks like everybody's favorite granddad.

 He's such a lovely demeanor and he only spoke to me for about three minutes. And what I found out later is he just wanted to look me in the eye see if I was sincere and um then he said to me anyway we're here to enjoy the cars today, here's my card, next time you're in London give me a call and um we'll have a chat. So I called him, went to his place and followed the instructions and got there, it's the penthouse suite right next door to Tate Modern Gallery on Southbank. The apartment must have been worth about £10 million and I go up to the top floor and it's plate glass window from floor to ceiling and you look out over the whole of London you can’t even see the Thames.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3842s)

Oh we froze at the wrong moment. Just getting into that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3848s)

You froze there sorry that's all right carry on we couldn't see out of the Thames I was well into the yeah I got the imagery there…

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3858s)

 Yeah so you could see right over London and you couldn't even see the Thames because the Thames was so far below and we were so close to the Thames.

Anyway and he chatted to me for like three hours and went over everything and he said I want to help you and I said that's really kind of you but why I have nothing I've got no money because all my money's in the business. I can never, I can't afford to pay you anything and he said to me Stephen, it's not about money [sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3888s) good people do good things for good people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3891s)

Hmm.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3892s)

And that still makes the hair on the back of my neck go up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3896s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3896s)

Yeah and he was a um a chartered accountant by trade and a founding partner in London's biggest accountancy company for most of his life and he was also financial director sat on the board of the Big Yellow Storage company, financial director sat on the board of HRO in the world's biggest Ferrari dealership um and also financial director sat on the board of a £2 [billion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3926s) pound construction company.

So I'm just completely, I'm still in awe by the way but um absolutely me and such a lovely guy so so decent, and anyway so I was like okay, it's really kind of you thanks and so he started ringing me and emailing me and texting me and I was replying to him and telling him over a course of a few weeks or months, and then he said right I've got enough [background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3957s) from you now, I'm going to ring your business partner and ask him without provoking him if I can come in and have a chat with him, that I'm just helping you and I'd like to help your business, and it was very shortly after that that he kicked me out because he knew he wouldn't be able to manipulate Adrian. strong ally.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3985s)

He was a strong ally.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=3986s)

Yeah, and someone that knew what he was talking about. And when I got kicked out of the business on the 10th of December 2014, I rang Adrian in tears and said, he's done it. He's handed me a letter and claims that I owe him a lot of money, which I didn't. But legally I did because he'd hidden it in the accounts and I hadn't seen it. And Adrian rang me back and said,;

“Hi, Stephen. Sorry, I was in the middle of a board meeting with the Big Yellow Storage Company. Soon as I heard your voicemail, I told them I had an urgent matter to attend to. And I'm in my car and I'm on my way to Cirencester to come and see you and talk to you.” 

Leaves a massive board meeting to come and talk to me and we then went to a court case that dragged on for 15 months, it was horrendous in the High Court in London and every single day from Monday to Friday Adrian Martin either rang me or emailed me or sent me a text every single day. This guy is working in businesses worth billions and he's [messaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4062s) me or calling me every single day for 15 months for no money.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4069s)

How big of a comparison is that to the man at the top of a cult.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4076s)

How much care did he show you compared to the priest that was supposed to be looking after you so many years ago? And I think that the message to anyone inside who's listening for the one bad person you met in business Steven who did the dirty on you or whatever or left you high and dry you've met how many that wanted to help you. I mean that's three you mentioned just in that story.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4101s)

Oh yeah there's so many good people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4105s)

Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4106s)

And but it didn't stop them so Adrian actually advised me, I think rightly so, he said don't get another job in the industry while the court case was going on because it will affect you, it will affect your court case. And so I went seven months without having a job when I've never been out of work for a day in my entire life and work has always been my passion and I was just [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4137s) home doing nothing going around the bend and of course getting deeper and deeper into debt and I said to him Adrian I can't even pay my rent next month I I'm up to the limits of my overdraft I'm, I've got to work.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4158s)

And he said, he said, don't worry, Stephen. You'll be able to pay your rent next. I don't even know whether I should say how much he put in my bank. It was, let's just say, lots of tens of thousands. Way more than I needed to pay my rent um and I just cried I just couldn't believe it. 

And then at the same time I was playing tennis for Cirencester in the Gloucestershire County League at the time and had done for like the last three or four years up until that point. And um I became very very close friends with the three guys that were in my tennis team and one of them they knew what I was going through because I was in a mess and one of them came around to my apartment, sent me a text and said oh are you are you in can I call in for a cup of tea, I just wondered how you how you were?

And of course I was not in a very good place and I said, sure yeah come in and put maybe a cup of tea and he's driving [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4240s) a 20 year old VW Passat in a scruffy anorak.

Lovely lovely guy and funnily enoughthis guy knew my father because he used to do the um plumbing work at my dad's business many years ago and and he said, I just wanted to make sure you're okay because I'm really worried about you Steven, and I said, hey I'm fine I said, I'm not sure, I said, no I'm not fine actually I've got to the end of my job, this was this was but a couple [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4270s) days before Adrian put the money in my account, and and he said, so but you're still not working.

 I said, no because Adrian's advised me not to work and yet I've got to the end of my overdraft and I don't have a clue what I'm gonna do. I suppose they're gonna evict me. And he reached into his pocket and he, I don't even know if I'm allowed to say this even but he reached his pocket and he took £5,000 cash out of that pocket £5,000. 

And he said he said it's entirely up to you, you can take one you can take both or you can take none of them, not neither of them and I said, because I didn't know about the Adrian money thing I said, well I don't know how long I'm going to need it for so if you don't mind I'd like to take both. And he said to me I will never ever ask you for it back, I will never chase you, I will never charge you interest and I don't want you to sign any paperwork. He said all I ask is that you pay me back when you can. And it took me quite a few years and you know what I paid both of them back every single penny and it gave me so much pleasure to do so.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4351s)

Yeah yeah yeah and that's a prime example isn't it that brethren will teach you that you know everybody out here if they do something for you they want something in return and it's just not the case at all.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4364s)

Yeah yeah I think it's illustrated, what you've told us has illustrated that beautifully it's um people genuinely want to help and when you're in a position to repay that help, you needed that help at that point in time, yeah when you got into a position to repay you could gladly do so but they never asked for it, they didn't expect it they didn't make you sign to do it there was no conditions attached to it nothing.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4388s)

Exactly, exactly and the same was with Adrian and when I realized and I said to him like that's just that's so kind of you, thank you so much, and he also never asked me to sign any paperwork, never ever charged me interest on the money there was no ulterior motive and he never ever chased me to pay him back, although with him it was slightly different because the amount [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4418s) so much bigger. I did pay him a monthly payment over the several years so that it was slowly chipping down.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4429s)

 Yeah so it just dropped a little bit, yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4430s)

Yeah and then of course we did, we made a lot of money in uh 2020 and 2021 and I was able to pay it all back in a lump sum but that's...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4443s)

Fantastic.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4443s)

Yeah. Sorry Steve I was just going to say in contrast to that um I was in the Priory by the brethren and lend me the money and they wanted paying back ASAP, no questions asked. And, you know, it just shows the total, you know, difference between people out here and people in there.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4465s)

Yeah, and yet they tell you that everyone out here is horrendous and evil.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4470s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4474s)

I always affectionately refer to Adrian Martin as my angel in a Ferrari.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4481s)

That's lovely yeah yeah angels in Ferrari are good eh? Well Stephen thank you so much for coming on and sharing your story with us, we really do appreciate it and I think it's um you're a true testament to resilience, you really are. There is just one thing you're still here and you're still smiling and we won't keep you much longer but there was just one thing I wanted to ask you because obviously you've still got that hole in your heart where your kids are and [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4512s) on. If by any remote chance your kids ever saw this podcast what would you want to say to them?

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4524s)

It's a tough one isn't it? Very tough one. I would just want to say to them that I still love them so much it hurts and it hurts me every single day and I will never ever stop loving them and I hope one day that they will be back in touch.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4552s)

I think we all think that.

### [**Stephen Gear**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJ72PbrKhk&t=4553s)

Yeah I again I would never want anybody to do anything that they don't want to do so like with my ex-wife I never tried to influence her to leave and I never never asked her to leave and  I wouldn't say the same thing if my children contacted me, I wouldn't try to influence them or or even help them to leave. I would just be very thankful for a phone call to be able to speak to them and to tell them how much I loved them.

Yeah, and I think that summarises the feelings of all of us really. We're not there to pull people out the brethren, we're not there to say get out of that place, if they want to stay there that's fine, but we are here to say, stop tearing people's hearts apart by dividing families. I think that's it isn't it?

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
