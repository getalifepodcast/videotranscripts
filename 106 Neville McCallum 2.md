## Summary

If Part 1 of Neville and Pip's story didn't shock you, part 2 will. Neville dives into his mom's heart-wrenching story and how disposable she was to the Exclusive Brethren. Neville walks through the abuse of alcohol in the cult and his conversations he has had with others on this topic. We go through more letters that leave you rocked to the core, especially for the younger generations who didn't know what all was happening in the 1960s.
I think it's safe to say that this cult has diseased roots of power, greed, and alcoholism that stem way back. How do those inside watch these podcasts and not get up and walk out? How do we help them see that their faith will follow them and help them through all changes needed to rebuild their lives? If you are looking for stability in your Christian faith, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is anything but that! If you want to be tied to a money hungry business man and his minions, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church will take over your mind, money and life to line their pockets- all under the disguise of Christianity.
If you are looking to be free of the chaos you are experiencing, there is a life beyond the PBCC cage where you will fully understand what family and faith truly are. Neville provides ample letters, his book, and 4 hours of history that we all needed to understand these roots of the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

Coming up in part two of Pip and Neville's podcast.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=62s)

Yeah. So they know when the cookie is really crumbling, but they wanted to know all her sexual activity before marriage up to that date. At two o'clock in the morning, they were still there getting turned on by all this crap.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3DNW53TlwEWcU%26t%3D78s)

I hope every insider that reads this book realizes what a hellhole they are in, treating people like that. To me, that is the lowest point of abuse that you can give to somebody who is disabled, and then you're doing what you like. It's just, it's just horrific, absolutely horrific.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=99s)

That's what the bullies do, yeah. They pick on the weak and the vulnerable. Yeah, that's what Hales is doing. I thought, that's so sad. That's the potential of the whole church in those young teenagers, and all they're being taught to do is to drink whiskey because they're not allowed to do anything else.

The street just filled with racing cars, racing and tires squealing up to us, confronting us. And he said, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=129s) three or four or five officers standing on the footpath doing surveillance on this house. And he said, so we got in our cars and we drove away. And I said to him, what, you're the police and you buckled to these criminals? And he said, we feared mass violence.

So I said, tell me what's causing it. And I couldn't believe what he said. Oh, he said, it's these jolly breaks [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=160s) 20 people walk in and she's got to do all the meals and the catering. And he just flew off about the breaks. I said, well, you know where you start, you don't have any more visitors.

The priestly area really is a huge one. We all know that. I mean, I got a call from a young woman in Christchurch and she said, I'm being visited without my husband because he's staying in, but I'm not sure what to do. So I'm on my own. She said, and I've got these perverted little beggars around in my home at two o'clock in the morning trying [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=199s) find out my sexual activities to date. You couldn't read about it.

So I know he's a little bigot. So I wrote him a letter, found out his address, and told him if he ever visited that home again, I was going to come around to his home and deal with him. She never ever got another visit. Wow. Yeah. So they know when the cookie's really crumbling, but they wanted to know all her sexual activity before marriage up to that date. At two [o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=235s)'clock in the morning, they were still there getting turned on by all this crap.

They are just evil to the core. And the person that we just had through the sound lost eight children and his half a million. He attended a priestly meeting for his son where he had got a little bit too friendly with a young lady in a haystack or something, and they wanted to know all the sexual [positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=265s) that they used. And he was so disgusted, he just got up and walked out. I said, you shouldn't have done that. You should have picked up your son and taken him out and given the other two a good boot in the backside. I said, that is totally off the charts.

Then I talked to somebody in Sydney, one of the Gages when he was a priest, and he said they did exactly the same thing. They got a young couple and they screwed every position that they used out of them in detail. And then two of the priests went to the same home to sleep that night. The person that told me didn't, he went to his own home, but the two priests, one of them might have been living out of town, so he stayed in.

And in the morning, one priest said to the other priest, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=326s) their wives were there, he said, the noise coming out of your bedroom last night, what, did you have an argument or something? He said, no, we were trying all those positions that we hadn't heard of before. And he was telling me with tears dripping off his cheeks, he said, that's how wicked we were. So that came straight from the horse's mouth. That's what goes on, but the brethren are never told that.

Brethren are never told that.

So, and that's why my story on the aphrodisiac stag, when we get to that one, is quite a, that's quite a funny one. They could all into this sexual thing. They hounded me on, as I say in the book, on how did Pip and I, and finally I just had to almost swear at him. And I just said straight out, if you think I've been a filthy bastard or whatever before we got married, and you think that's the [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=388s) of person I am, I said, why don't you just tell me then? Because we didn't, we were completely clear.

And then he bowed down, he was a priest that does all the somersaults, he just about did a forward roll onto the floor. Oh no Neville, no Neville, I would never think of, never think of you like that. Oh shut up then. And it was never ever spoken of again. But it took up three priestly visits just on that sexual tripe. They were just getting off on it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=415s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=416s)

Yeah, it's serious. That side of it is serious.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=420s)

And that still goes on today. Like, you hear a lot of it. I had some horror stories land on my lap a couple of days ago, and it's just heart-wrenching, heart-wrenching what they put people through inside there.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=432s)

They love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=435s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=435s)

They love it. The other one we had, which was a pretty serious one, was in a house in Auckland where an Indian family was being really, really dealt to. And there were three children in the family. The wife had died, so the husband was caring for the children, come out from India. And the brethren had set them up in Auckland, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=465s) he rang me. I didn't know him. He rang me and said that they were having trouble, things were being stolen out of their house.

And I said, well, what do you mean? What's been stolen out of your house? And he said, well, they just walked in here and picked up my computer and just walked out with it. And he said, I contested it and tried to get it. They wouldn't give it back to me. And they took it away and had it for a week or two weeks or whatever it was. Must have downloaded the whole thing probably and then brought it back to him. I said, well, you can't [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=496s) up with that. That's criminal. These guys need to go to jail. Oh, well, he said, there's other things they're saying. They're just absolutely beating us into the ground.

So I don't know whether he asked me to come up or ask for help or whatever, and I said, well, look, I'll come to Auckland and see you then. So I grabbed Leon Jansen and we went up there. And as we got out of the car, he said, you're being watched. He said, there's a camera up on the roof of the house next door and it shines straight in my lounge and kitchen. They can see everything that goes on in my house. And so as I walked past, I saw [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=538s) camera, so I just gave them a good wave. We went inside.

And he pulled all the curtains. I said, what are you pulling all the curtains for? Oh, he said, well, I don't want them to see what we're doing in here. And there's others over the fence there, they're brethren too. I don't want them to see that you're here, really. So he pulled all the curtains and he said, I'm frightened somebody's gonna come and have a go at me or whatever. And I thought, oh, you know, maybe he's an Indian and he's overreacting.

But we were sitting there discussing it, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=574s) all of a sudden I see a shape coming along in front of the curtains. And I just said to Rom, look out, somebody's coming. And he just leapt up, get out of here, go, get out. And he was almost yelling. Well, we up and disappeared out of the room and down the hall, and this house I'd never been in before, jumped into a room that happened to be his office and slammed the door shut. And then we listened, we could hear what was happening.

And this young guy came in and he just tore strips off him. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=605s) said, you got people, who have you got in here? And Rom said, I don't have to tell you who I've got in here. Rom was withdrawn from, he didn't tell him anything. And the yelling and shouting started and he was pleading with this guy to get out. And he said, no, I'm not getting out. He said, where have you hidden them? I'm going to go and get them. Where have you hidden these guys?

And I'm looking at Leon, and Leon's a bit bigger than me. I said, hey, we're in for a fight. Well, I was used to that with all the poaching we have at the sound. I've had 30 people through court. I know what it is to have to fight. And I said, we're going to have to deal with it. This is going to go violent. So I said to Leon, you get on the floor and lean up against the door and I'll hold the door up here. But I said, if he's strong enough to come in, it's only going to take one punch and he'll be on the carpet.

So I stood there holding the door with effort, ready for the next one, while Leon's down on the floor sweating with fright because he'd never been in a brawl in his life. And he tried, he came to the door, then he turned around and he walked away. And I heard him go and shut the door. So we came out and I thought, this is going to be interesting. We came out into the lounge and Rom just sat there, [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=684s) on his left, and he just sat there just looking at the floor, not saying a word, not moving, as if he'd been comatized.

And I thought, oh, perhaps the guy's hit him or something. So I said to Rom, did he know we were here? And he said, well, look at your four shoes on the floor and your cup of tea each on the little table. He said, of course they knew two of you were here. Well, that was obvious. We'd disappeared, but all our evidence hadn't. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=715s) so I said to him, I didn't say anymore because I could tell there was a problem. So I thought, I'll let Leon make the first move.

So he turned to Rom and he said, who was it, Rom? And Rom never answered him. And I thought, this is because the Indians talk, you know, very quick and they're very quick off the mark with their voices. And I thought something's wrong. So Leon asked him again, he said, who was it, Rom? And he just looked at the floor and he said, it was your own son. And it [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=745s) to be Leon's own son who he loved, who was still in fellowship. He's the only one in his family left in fellowship.

And I looked at Leon straight away and I literally saw, this is not exaggerating, I literally saw the colors fade out of his cheeks with shock when he realized that that person that was after him, and I was going to break his jaw, was his own son visiting Auckland. And he married the girl who was a next-door neighbor to the Indian's house. So he was at that house and somebody must have called and said, hey, Rom's got crooks in there, go and deal with it.

And he happened to be the closest young man who would be prepared to get into a brawl. But I just thank the Lord he never opened that door because it would have been all over. Because when I listened out in the lounge, I knew he was capable of being violent, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=803s) we would have had to react that way to protect ourselves.

So while I, when I left, I said to Rom, well, how are we going to stop these people invading your house? That guy had no right to crash into his house. And I said, I know what I'll do. Do you want to see these priests back in your house again? He said, no, no. I said, I could give you a break for two years. He said, oh, really? So I rang the police and I checked with the police and I said, I think you know how evil [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=837s) Exclusive Brethren are and how violent they are, don't you? And the guy on the phone said, yes, I do. I thought, oh, good, we're on the same page.

I told the police what had happened in the house. I told him about having his computer flogged without his consent and all the rest of it. So I picked out the three leading priests in Auckland, who one of them was a Simmons, and I got the police to deliver a trespass notice which forbade them to go back into that property for two years or go to jail. So those three leading priests could never go back and see into Ron's house for two years. So that's how you deal with priests you don't want.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=883s)

Man, what a story.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=885s)

Yeah, that's true, true blue. Leon would back that all the way. Yeah, I keep in touch with the Indians, maybe once a year I'll just give them a ring and see how they are. But they may have had faults, but no matter, when you've got faults, you should never get treated like that. All our faults have to be dealt with, but at the priestly level, everything gets handled absolutely the worst possible way you could do it. And it's all to injure those people and make them [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=921s) bad and make the priest feel elated.

The other one was Pip's sister, my sister-in-law, she got withdrawn from. And that was the Miles Deck case, which was an awful case in here. That's one of the three of the worst that I've actually put in here. And when she was withdrawn from, her husband had just died in their 50s with five children. And a person who was involved came back and told me when your sister-in-law was withdrawn from, the priests came home and they literally jumped and danced over the chairs and the sofas in the lounge. I mean, this is Russia, this is Iran.

Those guys doing that sort of thing, they should be in jail. And that woman had to suffer that for six years or however many years it was. And the reason they withdrew her, they didn't actually have anything on her, nothing. They wanted to link her with somebody else they wanted to withdraw. So she went through all that and it smashed her family to smithereens, not because they had anything against her. They had nothing on her, [nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1005s).

They wanted to link her with an adultery offense to get rid of the guy, and the guy happened to be my brother-in-law. And it never happened. It was a complete jacked-up case against the Deck family in New Zealand because Symington hated the Decks, because Ron Deck brought in “the pause” after Aberdeen, which was the very right thing that should have been done. There should have been a pause [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1035s) a regroup. But because Symington wanted to control the brethren, he dealt with Ron Deck to get rid of the pause.

And then they gave ministry on how the sins of the fathers go down to the next generation. So they wanted to deal with Miles. So they accused those two of adultery, withdrew from both of them. She was totally innocent, Miles was totally innocent, but they got rid of another Deck. That's how wicked and evil the Miles Deck withdrawal was. He got fired from work. He [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1072s) Ivory Brothers' top salesman. They fired him. He picked up his briefcase and they wouldn't even give him the company car to drive home from Petone to Wellington, which, that's a long way. He had to walk down the road and get a bus to get home to his family, and he was their top salesman.

So, a serious, serious case that was. When you think of that, to get him, they had to get rid of her and put her through hell, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1103s) because they wanted to have a go at Ron Deck's son who hadn't done anything wrong. I mean, this priestly thing, this level of evil in the priestly circle is off the charts.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1118s)

Yeah, there's just story after story, isn't there? It's, yeah, I agree with you. There's just so many very horrifying stories of hell. And yeah, they're all lives. Like, you know, you can almost get overloaded from just hearing story after story after story. But each person, it's not also just an individual, it's their spouse, their children, their employees, their extended family. Like each one of these lives that has been devastated [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1148s) this spiritual abuse.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1150s)

Yes.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1151s)

A terrible use of power, it's just, it's an implosion within a family as well.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1156s)

Yes. I've got a friend in Nelson who was withdrawn from and his wife was taken off him. And the neighbors rang him and said, look, we're seeing things happen around your house at night. We had it too. And these guys are coming and prowling around your house and looking in the windows or whatnot at night in the pitch dark. And we're not going to put up with it. We've got baseball bats and we're going to go and deal with them.

Well, very kind neighbors, I wouldn't mind a neighbor like that. And so he went out and bought a whole lot of women's underwear and hung it on his clothesline [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1195s) turn these perverted priests on, which I thought that was a bit of a crack-up. Yeah, just to give them something to go home with, you know.

But we had a funny one in Nelson over the Clive Petrie jailing case. And four women came to me, well, they asked who could help and my friend mentioned my name. And I said, well, I'm not going to them. I don't want to get involved in that. If they want to come to me, that's fine. So they did. So I took up their case for them and found out what, when women get in that situation, they can't face going to the police station on their own and meeting a male policeman and having to spill the beans. That's what stops them going to court with these cases. That's [step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1249s) one that stops them.

So I said, well, I'll do that for you, but I won't go any further. I'll get you in the door and then I'm gone. And I did. They got the guy, and that's where the Tony McCorkell comes into a terrible battle we had with him in Wellington and the TV, you know. And anyway, I thought I'll go to the closing day in the court and hear what the, what Clive Petrie's lawyer's got to say about his innocence.

So I walk in and there's a guy sitting down the back seat in the public gallery and I have to step over him to get past him. He's wearing a suit and tie. And I get in there and I hear the lawyer going off about this ex-member who's vindictive against the brethren and he's brought my client in here and he's not guilty. And I'm looking at this lawyer and he's looking at me and he's really spouting off. And I'm thinking, if only you knew, mate, you're talking to me.

 [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1304s) that was quite funny. When I went to get up to go out, I looked at this guy again and I thought, I don't believe it. It's Jeff Smith, the leading priest in Nelson, and I'd been sitting alongside him, didn't recognize, he hadn't recognized me. So I thought, oh, I'll have a chat. So he gets up to go out just as we leave the courtroom, still in the courtroom, I said, g'day Jeff, really nice to see you. And always, they'll never argue anything, always [pleasant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1334s), ask about health and the weather and keep the Exclusive Brethren thing right out of it.

And he turned around and he took one look at me and his jaw just dropped and he was off. And when I say off, I mean running. He ran out, he ran down the corridor, he went to go down the steps. And I thought, yeah, I think I can go down, I'm a hunter, I hunt alpine country, I think I can go down these stairs a bit quicker than you. And he went to go down them and then he saw the lift and he said, oh no, be safer in the [lift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1364s). And I thought, you beauty, we're going to get in the lift together. I can't believe this.

And he presses a button like this. So I get in the lift with him and I said, g'day Jeff, we're up pretty close now, it's really good to see you. And his chin was going, it was literally just shaking on his jaw. He was trembling with fear. And I said, what's wrong, frightened of you, Jeff? I said, we're friends, we grew up together, we're Christians, what's wrong? Why can't you just talk to me?

And as the lift went down, he looked at the ground button and he started pressing it before he got to the ground floor. And he just went about 20 times before the door was open. He was completely [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1410s) of it, out of the lift and out the corridor and out the back front door. And there's a big car park quite close to the road. And I thought, how can I stop this guy? How can I put a spanner in the works? So I said to him, oh, did you hear that Bruce Hales is going to withdraw from you?

Well, he stopped so suddenly I bumped into him. He just put the brakes on, whammo, spun around. Well, what do you mean? he said, and his jaw was all trembling. And I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1440s), because of the Clive Petrie case. I wanted to bring the four women into your meeting room for your assembly meeting. And if they would hear their accuser say sorry and carry the brethren with it, they will not go to court. I said, wouldn't that have been a better option than all these court cases? And now he's [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1470s) jail for, going to be for two years or whatever.

But when we made that request, McCorkell and McNaughton in Sydney approved it because I heard him on the phone. They rang Nelson and you stopped it. So I think he's going to withdraw from you. Well, that made it worse for him because everything I said was true. And he just freaked out. And I thought, well, I'm going to follow him, but I don't want him to get into the big part of the car park. If I could keep him up this end, I'm going to be able to walk a little further with him, you know, as Stanley McCallum would say, down the mobile road together.

So we headed [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1513s) the car park and I stayed on the roadside of him. And when we went between two cars, I'd go a bit faster. Then I'd come out and I'd cut him off and he'd have to turn back. So I kept on turning him back into the end of the car park where his car wasn't, because I knew he was heading for where his car was. So I was trying to stop him. Well, we went right across this car park, we must have gone through 20 cars. And I thought, where on earth are we going?

We came to the end of the car park and there was a garden and there were [plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1543s) and shrubs about six foot high, all quite close together. And then there was a drop-off of about half a metre into the next driveway. Here I am following him. He's charging through these bushes, through this garden. I said, you're lost, Jeff. You're lost. Stop. Where are you going? You're getting lost. He went through these bushes and over this bank. We ended up in the backyard of some private residence. I just couldn't believe what was happening.

Then, of course, he had [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1573s) turn left to get out to the road. So then we walked together all the way out to the road and I was just talking to him gently all the way. Jeff, something is wrong. Why can't we just talk together? Christians don't act like this. Talked to him all the way. He went out, got in his car, held the door open for him just to help him along. And when he was ready and got his seatbelt on, I thanked him very much and I shut the door and he toodalooed off.

I went and got my vehicle, which was just behind him a bit, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1603s) when I pulled out, I got down the road 50 meters and here he is in his car, he pulled up and parked again. And he was just leaning forward with his eyes shut. I reckon he just about had a heart attack. And he obviously couldn't drive on, and that's why he pulled up and parked again. And I look at that whole story and I think, this thing's just not real, you know? Something is just so far out of kilter. I wasn't attacking, I never said anything nasty, I respected him [fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1633s) when I tried to talk to him. Yeah, just those real life pictures tell you what's going on underneath that you don't normally get a chance to see.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1647s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1648s)

Yeah. So, the priestly service, it's, there's so much damage in it. It was the aphrodisiac stag. And when we were shut up, my brother-in-law, who was a fringy, he got shut up sometime after we did. We were driving out for a picnic one day and here he is driving the bulldozer that I sold him when my business was sold, driving it on the Lord's Day. So I leant out the window and went as if to say, [naughty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1682s) boy, what are you doing on the bulldozer on the Lord's Day? And he just put his thumb up and went as if to say, yeah, mate, right, but this is good. I thought, ha-ha, so you're shut up too.

So what had happened was, and then a day or two later, he would bring his bulldozer across the road by my vineyard. And you have to plank a machine on the road, it doesn't cut the tarmac up. So you put a board on the road, you drive the dozer on it, and then you put another one in the front, you drive ahead, you get the one at the back, put that in the front. So it's quite a job on your own. So I thought, I wonder if I go out and do that for him, we should get into a little bit of a conversation, which when you're both shut up, of course, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1724s) wrong.

But I thought, well, it's safety, it's health and safety because a car might come along and have an accident. So I gave my hand, so I did that for him. When he pulled over onto the grass, I thought, he's either going to give me a smile and he's going to be with me, or he's going to be against me. Or thirdly, he might have had a spiritual turn and he's trying to trap me so he can go back to the priest and say, hey, Neville came and talked to me while he was shut up, that's not good. So you know, you go back and be tougher on him. I mean, he could have been doing that too.

So I had to assess all this, and he turned the motor off and I thought, oh, he's going to talk. He turned the motor off, then he looked down at me and smiled. [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1765s) was the first smile we'd had since we'd been shut up. And I thought, oh, he's on my side. So he got off the machine and we had a chat. We talked for about half an hour. And in the middle of it, he said, oh, how many stags have you shot lately? And I said, Norm, because this is frowned on in the brethren, we'd been taken to task on this in the meeting for going hunting. So we'd already been whacked about it.

And then he blatantly just said, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1796s) know, you've been hunting? I said, no. And I used the worst words I could have used, no, Norm, I'm a good boy. Well, that came back and every visit right till the bitter end, that Neville McCallum thinks he's a good boy. And anyway, I said, what about you then? You've been, yeah, he's, I went and got a stag and it was covered with velvet on the antlers, which of course you sell off to China for, you know, a sex stimulant. And he's like $12.50 for it, which [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1826s) in those days, that was like $1,250.

And so the priests come, after this session, the priests came next time and they said, do you really think you're filling your position? That's why this comes into the book on nearly every page to the end. And I said, well, I think so, yes. Well, we don't think you are. No, why can you tell me? They said, no, the Lord should be telling you to tell us. You should know what you're doing if you're not filling your position.

I thought, now what have I done? I got my farm right, that's been a problem. We had a caravan, that was a problem. I haven't been eating and drinking with anybody and I still got the one wife. And I sort of just went on and on like it does for half an hour with all these long emotional, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1879s) know, psychological abuse gaps, you know, when you wind the old alarm clock up so it goes off on the mantelpiece all the time.

And I finally said, well, look, if you're not going to tell me what I've done, you bodies will go home because I cannot honestly think of what I've done. And they said, well, you told somebody you're a good boy. And I thought, I don't believe this. So Norman, my brother-in-law, has potted me at his priestly visit and he's potted me calling me a [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1909s) boy. Now he knew when he did that, I was going to be in more trouble because he's a bit of a jokester, right? So he potted me, just about made my case worse.

And then I thought, how can I get back at him, you little snot? Of course, I had to accept. Then I spent half an hour trying to prove to them I didn't mean that I was a good boy, it was a joke. But they wouldn't take it as a joke because it was fuel for their priestly [abuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=1940s). And I couldn't get away from this, I was a good boy and I should never have said that. And then they said, well, what did you talk to Norman about? And I said, well, we didn't say anything about the brethren, we didn't say anything negative about the brethren.

But, oh, one thing he did tell me though, and I suddenly thought of it, he went hunting and he got this stag with all this sexual stuff on the horns and he sold it for an aphrodisiac, went to India or somewhere. He got $12.50, they said. And I could see in their eyes, give me some of that stuff, you know, I could just see it coming out of them. They couldn't get out of our room quick enough to get around to his place to have a go at him because he'd been hunting.

So this is how it works, you know. And when I met my brother-in-law in the review, we didn't talk about any of this past stuff too much, but I brought that one up with him. I said, you dirty, dirty beggar over the good boy. But I said, I got you with the sex stimulant, didn't I? And he just burst out laughing. He hadn't forgotten it either. I'd gotten back on him because he would have taken a pounding over that. Oh yeah. So that was one that was funny.

But I think we saved ourselves by not [doing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2023s) what others did. We didn't stay at home and mope when we were shut up and withdrawn from. We got out and we went for picnics. We deliberately just went out and had a picnic just to get away from it. And I saw others not do that. Then they turned to drink and, you know, the marriages broke up. We did the opposite. I had a caravan which I had to have because I had to sleep on the vineyard because I couldn't work. And the workers would come and meet me in the caravan, tell me [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2053s) they'd done, and then I'd tell them what to do when I had the neck issue.

So we had a caravan. So we'd wait until the brethren were at the meetings and then whip out with the caravan and go and have a night somewhere until we got potted. So we had a caravan, but all those things, I think, helped to keep us stable in that critical six months or 12 months after you were withdrawn from.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2079s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, incredibly easy to be completely psychologically destroyed at that point and to be really full of despair. So you're saying that you guys managed to keep finding some things that gave you space and headspace and gave you some joy?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2097s)

Sometimes when we felt a bit down and we could tell something might happen that, you know, wouldn't be good, we'd just get in the vehicle and we'd just go out and drive for an hour. And you look at the scenery and you forget, you know, you forget the pressure. It just gives you that little bit of release. And we did that for months.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2117s)

You guys were shut up for a long time though. Like, how long were you shut up for before you were withdrawn from? Three years?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2122s)

Yeah, yeah. So we just kept doing those little things.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2129s)

For the listener, it's like, just, yeah, for those who aren't familiar with the brethren, sorry, but this means like complete social isolation. Like Neville said, you can't just go and have coffee with your neighbor or, you know, have some other friends you met somewhere else around because then you'll get even more in trouble for that. And you can't have anything to do with any brethren, no letters, no phone calls, nothing.

So, like, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. So it's, it's like, it's horrendous. It's [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2159s) a psychological equivalent, like it is silent treatment. It's like throwing somebody into, what do they call it, isolation at the prison cells, right? Like you're, so it's hard for people to wrap their heads around because there's not physical walls or chains holding you down, but psychologically you are, you're in this silent zone, forbidden from social contact with outsiders. It's horrendous. Like, to last, to experience that for three years is horrific.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2186s)

And you can feel it in the story. Like, when I read that book, you could feel the length.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2194s)

Yeah, and that's all doing it. Like, you know, my father was shut up for two years and months. It was so common, and it still is common for people to go for months without being visited. And it's just so cruel because the priests see you like your lifeline. They're holding your life in the balance. They're the ones who get to say like whether you live or die. And they can just sit there and not visit you for weeks or months, leaving you like, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2219s)

Yeah, we only had one visit in 13 months.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2223s)

There you go. That's an example of it. That's just...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2227s)

To start off, which was the worst time. Yeah, six months before we got a visit and then five months, yeah, that's 11 months. And then they came much, much quicker after that when I had to defend my little bike and how sick I was. And we had a stillborn child, so they used that of course to push their barrow. And yeah, but and that's why [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2257s) jumped into another church quite quickly because of our children. After we were out, we acted reasonably quickly there as well to try and build a friendship base for them and for ourselves.

And fortunately, one of the persons there used to be in the meeting in Wellington and she spoke to Pip because Pip was from Wellington and said, look, we realize the situation you people are in. Come around and have a cup of tea with us. She realized what a huge predicament that was. And she said, I'm sure that Neville will get on with my husband well because he's a hunter. I thought, oh, that's all, well, that's okay.

And I get, and then I meet him around the back of the house, he's got this great big long beard. Oh, beards are wrong, he shouldn't have beards, you know. And I've got to associate with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2311s) guy with a big beard. So that was the first little negative. And he turned out to be one of my best friends. So they just, they knew just where to plug the gap, which is what we're trying to do with people coming out now, just to try and get them at the right time.

Like we did with the guy Gordon in Thames. I had to talk to him and he was going to jump off a bridge. That's how far he got. So I just straight into the North Island, Graham Leon, and we just drove straight up to his house to just try and give him some support on those critical first few days. And that goes on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2353s)

Is that today? It is really preached in there right now, really preached in there that it is really better to take your life than it is to leave.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2363s)

Are you serious? Yeah, like...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2365s)

It's, I had a story, again, all the stories that land on my lap, I had a story, the same thing. Literally, they used the word suicide.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2372s)

Yeah, they did. Yeah, I gave that to the Royal Commission.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2375s)

Okay, yeah, so you knew. But yeah, it's just heart-wrenching. I mean, that's why we're all doing what we're doing, each one of us here, right? This is why we do it. We do it because we care. We do it because this has to stop. This has to stop.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2389s)

No, we want the folks inside that are listening to this, even though we don't know you, we still care about you. Yeah. Because we know the circumstances. We're not against you. We just hope something clicks, you hear something or you see something that helps you sort it out.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2411s)

Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, thanks for sharing all these stories, Neville. As Cheryl said, it's not just your history. It's the history of your wider family, and it's our history too, because it's, yeah, people who have impacted our lives and our generations and our extended family members. And it's, yeah, it's just the same.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2439s)

We're in this together, aren't we?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2440s)

We're in this together, yep. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say. Yeah. And it's also super cool to hear of, yeah, your ongoing support for for leavers and that kind of thing. And, yeah, that you've got this wee pad there in the sounds. I've still never visited, but it sounds amazing. So yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2458s)

Yes, we hope you can come and see us sometime.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2460s)

Yeah, yeah, I hope that you'll be able to help many more people.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2467s)

It's quite funny with one, but the person who lost the eight children and the money and whatnot, he came in, he said, I don't want to see any brethren. But when we came home that day, we met all the brethren coming back from the Nelson interchange on the road between Blenheim and the port. It's half an hour travel. And when we come into church, we often meet 25 cars going to Nelson when they [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2497s) doing it to change, was not now. And then we'd go back and later in the day, we'd meet them all, the drunkies all coming back with the little kids driving, you know, because they're too intoxicated.

And so we're driving home and all of a sudden he's driving down the road thinking he escaped from the Exclusive Brethren. The next minute, Exclusive Brethren, Exclusive Brethren, Exclusive Brethren, one after the other drove past, yeah, on the highway.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2521s)

Oh man, yeah, yeah, I've had that happen to me before as well. Yeah, and because often it's like, almost like a convoy, right? Because they're all leaving or they're all together, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2531s)

Some of the younger ones know my vehicle and boat and everything now and they'll actually wave out to me before I wave to them. Wow. It's funny, they know it that well. Yeah, they're probably thinking, I'd love to get in that boat.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2545s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2547s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2548s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2549s)

I think I'm gonna have to wind it up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2552s)

Dear, I wondered if you did. I know you have little, little ones. Yeah, well.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2556s)

Lovely to see you both and yeah, good, yeah, thanks again Neville for sharing this stuff. It's flipping brilliant to have it on record like this. Thank you so much, Lindy, for coming.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2566s)

Okay. Okay, take care, love.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2569s)

See you. Bye.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2571s)

Bye-bye. Thank you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2573s)

Yeah, you too. 

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Let's start with your mom.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2576s)

Yeah, her case was a very sad one. She came off an orchard with a nice home and gardens and everything else. My father dies. My sister who was living with her on the orchard property, she gets married. Then mum's on her own, but she's not allowed to live on her own. So she has to come and live with me. So she goes from a, normally had 40 acres, a two-story home and a garden and just the normal thing somebody would have, into a room four meters by four meters. And that's all she had, with two young yelling, screaming kids. I mean, it was just so wrong and she was forced to live there.

And obviously it got her down. Didn't take long before it got her down. And we were having an argument one day about what she should do or shouldn't do, and that perhaps she should build on to the back of my house to make more rooms for her. And she slapped me, just like a mother would slap a son. It didn't actually hit me, I saw it coming. But I had to tell the priest of what was happening and whatnot. So they put it in front of Symington and he withdraws from her.

So here she is, nowhere to live. Her house had been sold by this time, so she had nowhere to go. She had a section that she could have built on, that she wanted to build on, that they wouldn't let her [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2680s) on. And it had a garden shed. So she made her bed in a bath in a garden shed, having come from a 40-acre orchard, two-story home. Oh, that's heart-wrenching. She's in a bath trying to live. No shower, no running water, no power, no nothing.

And we are there watching this happen every day, which was the worst part of it. And they think this is okay and humane. Yeah, absolutely inhumane. I mean, anybody in the Exclusive Brethren listening to this podcast that listens to something like that, if that doesn't rock you to the core, something is wrong. Yeah, and they got away with that.

So to keep the story short, it gets on top of her properly, so she tries to commit suicide. And fortunately, when she jumped in the water, it was so cold it gave her such a shock, it woke her, it sort of brought her back to her senses again. And she came home in the car and saw me and tried to run me over. So finally she stopped and I went to try and investigate. I thought, this is getting pretty bad, I've got to do something here. And her nightie, she was in a nightie, absolutely dripping wet from head to foot, and she'd come back from a dam that she knew where she jumped in.

And so after that, it got bad enough that her family, and this is where it's so difficult, her family who she could have nothing to do with after, they were part of our family, because all her siblings were out or never in fellowship, they turned the other cheek then and they came back to help her in the situation she's in now, which is a tough call. Yeah, because those people feel [abused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2807s), ill-treated. When you tell them they're not fit to eat with, they don't normally help you.

Well, they came back. They came back and helped my mother and gave her a home. Wow. And then she got married to a really, an ex-EB guy from a neighboring town, a really, really rough, hard, uncouth person, the opposite to my father, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2837s) absolute opposite to my father. But because she was so lonely, it connected and they got married. And they lived away in another town.

And then she got her house built that she wanted to build when she was in the meeting next to me. She builds a house, but she's got a husband now. So she builds this house, nice two-story home, and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2867s) live there and we're next door, we have nothing to do with each other. But another out, because we're still in at this point, another out that we knew very well would visit mum. And she came in one day and said to me, you need to do something about your mother, she's being knocked about. I said, really? And she said, yes, she is. And I think you should step up. She was an older, but a [little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2897s) bit older than me, a woman that I really respected.

So I thought, right. And by this time we were out, but I still hadn't had anything to do with him. So I thought, right, I'm not going to muck around. And I know when I get in there, he's not going to like me coming in the house. It's probably going to be a bit of a whoopsie day because that's the sort of person he was, a hardcore farmer. And so I never knocked. I just thought, no, this is the art, this is when you have to be a bigger bully than the bully if you want to win.

So I never knocked, I just walked straight in, first time I ever met him. And I just walked straight in. He was standing at the bottom of the stairs, and I said, where's mum? And he said, up there. I said, well, I'm going up. And I just walked straight at him. And I thought, this is going to go one way or the other. And he stepped aside and let me go up. Yeah. So that's the first time that we'd met her since she had been withdrawn from. And I go over that meeting in the book of being reunited. 

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=2975s) then we took her home after that. Well, we looked after her. She got Parkinson's and had to have a walker trolley. So, he died, fortunately, he died and got out of it. So she wasn't being knocked about or mistreated anymore. So we took her back into the family and wherever we went, she came. We took her to Australia in a wheelchair. And yeah, that went on until she passed away. And in the last few months, we left our vineyard property and we came and lived in her house so that we could do what, you know, the nurses had a certain amount to do, but we could do all the rest. So we did that till she passed. So that was a happy ending to what had been a very, very bad case.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3023s)

I can imagine it would have been very hard for you to watch, you know, walk yourself through all that too.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3029s)

Oh yeah. While we were still in, it was, because I knew I should have gone over and tried to do something. And my brother-in-law and I, you know, we, and then they diagnosed her as being mental. So then we had to put her in our car and take her groaning all the way to Nelson, which is a two-hour trip, and put her in the mental institution. She wasn't, she wasn't mental, no, no. And within a couple of weeks of there, [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3059s) wasn't mental at all. She came out again. So she had to go through all that, just because that's what Symington wanted to be done. Yep.

So yeah, so that case and the Miles Deck case were two really serious cases. And the other one, the Lawrence Faulkner case, Terry Deck handled that case. He was a cripple from the waist down, so he had to have bags for everything. When he went to the morning meeting, he got up at four o'clock. His wife got him up at four o'clock to prepare him to be able to go to the morning meeting. And that guy lived like that from his engagement night till he was 70-something years old.

You recount that in your book, and it is just absolutely heart-wrenching reading it. And it's just, I hope every insider that reads this book realizes what a hellhole they are in, treating people like that. Like, to me, that is the first, the lowest point of abuse that you can give is somebody who is disabled, and then you're doing what you like. It's just, it's just horrific, absolutely horrific.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3139s)

That's what the bullies do, yeah. They pick on the weak and the vulnerable. Yeah, that's what Hales is doing. He picks on the weak. He wants their money, and the weak, they can't buck the system because the rumor fires there, so they're locked in. Yeah, something has to happen from the inside out. I agree. Maybe, maybe, yes. Okay, so I think that that was all [we got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3169s) regarding mum's case. It was a horrific case, really, but at least we were reunited with her as a family, which that was, and you got to experience that. Yeah, yep, yep.

I spoke to JT Junior's daughter-in-law about what I was being told out here about JT Junior because I'd questioned JTJr. in the review, and that's what the priests didn't like, was me questioning [whether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3199s) he was right or wrong. And they said, well, he said that if the sun shone when he was buried, he was right. And something else, I forget what the other thing was. So I put this to Margaret Wilson, and I put that to her, and she said, what a joke. She said, that's a joke that's gone around the world.

She said, that wasn't true. She said, we said that as a joke. And then she said the other joke was that as the priests [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3230s) carrying the coffin, it got lighter, you know. And that, I think that's in the letter I sent you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3235s)

So this is a letter from Margaret Wilson to Neville. And it's just, so for our listeners that aren't watching this and are listening instead, it says, "Hi Neville, I see you're still struggling, fighting the battle on many fronts. Keep up the good work. It is freedom or bondage for many. My feelings on this question of rain or shine at Jim's burial is that this is a red herring. Jim had no authority to make such a claim. His teachings were erroneous. Many opposed them, but it was nearly impossible to depose him due to the way the brother movement was organized."

"[My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3266s) husband has read your letter, and his immediate comment was that JT Jr. would not have spoken to Ben once Ben was out of fellowship. The split in New York was on the 22nd of August and JTJr., I think, died in October. But when he was in bed with MK, Guy, my husband, is sure that the last thing on his mind was his funeral, whether the sun shone or not. I'm absolutely sure that there was no contact between Ben and his Dad. This claim that Jim made a pact with Ben regarding the sun shining or not shining was not spoken about at the time. I am sure the Taylor family would have [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3296s) it if it had happened."

"We were very close at this time and spoke to each other nearly every day. I can see the Jimites are using this latest story as a ploy to hold on to their shaky members, a feeble attempt. James said in a circular letter regarding his father's death that as they carried the coffin, it grew lighter. Some felt that this meant that the coffin weighed less or that Jim had been resurrected. Exclusives are very gullible. Refuse facts or are not allowed access to facts, remain ignorant. Jim died on the very day that the case instigated by JTJr. against [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3326s) Taylor, called Taylor vs. Taylor, came to the court."

"Both James and Ben were called away from the courtroom to their father's deathbed, hardly a father of love. The concept of letting the weather decide the outcome of a past is primitive, heathen, and superstitious. It is certainly not New Testament. One makes judgments using honest witness. Ben's witness regarding his father's alcoholism, along with the filth that came through on the tapes of Aberdeen, coupled with the witness of those hundreds of wholesome brethren that attended those meetings, is ample information for any clear-thinking [person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3357s)."

"It is difficult for your EB friends to see this, but the ministry of JT Jr. is classic cult material. Perhaps a discussion of other cults might help them to see the parallel of this cult. The most glaring attribute is their nearly complete loss of freedom and inability to use their God-given brain to make decisions. For example, since we have been out, we have lived in Bermuda for 12 years, been active members of several churches, our son taught English in China for a year, we give to charity, I work for the Red Cross and learn from the people I help, etc. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3388s) enjoy our television because we can control it and enjoy deep friendships with other ex-exclusives. Perhaps we could set up a correspondence between newly freed exclusives and those of us who have had time to adjust. I'm sure many of my friends would be happy to do this." 

Wow, that's a great letter.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3405s)

It is, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3406s)

She gives it with an exclamation mark.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3408s)

Yep, and it comes right from the horse's mouth, from the family that it needed to come from. As she said, they keep using those things to justify his existence. The whole alcohol thing, we have covered some of it, where JT Senior was the first to condone the drinking of strong alcohol. My father told me that. And my father went to Auckland, his brother lived there. He went to Auckland when the Aussies first started to come and interfere in New Zealand, which would have been pre-'65, pre-Bruce and John.

And they came to Auckland. They came to Dad's brother's home, my uncle, quite a number of them, for an evening. And they apologised because they were late. And they said, oh, well, we queued up at the pub to get a drink, and the queue was that long, it held us up for half an hour. And back in the early '60s, if you were caught at a pub in New Zealand, you'd get shut up. I mean, that was an offense back in the old days, you know.

And here these Aussies were coming over here saying they'd just been to the pub and they were brassed off that they got held up. They said something like, we had to push our way in. Oh, wow. But they knew Dad was against drink, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3496s) they knew my uncle was too. My family never ever drank hard drink. The only thing they ever drank about three times a year was a stout, and that was all. And we were really warned against it because some of our good friends were alcoholics in the brethren.

So Dad taught us very carefully what to do or what not to do with alcohol. So they asked Dad a question and they turned it to my father and they said, well, how much would we have to drink before you'd call us an alcoholic? [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3530s) was a loaded question because they were not happy about the way Dad and his brother thought about alcohol. And Dad said, oh, how am I going to get out of this one? And then he said, if you can't live without it. And there was just a deathly silence in the room. Who could answer that? That was one glass a week or one glass a minute, that didn't matter. He said, if you can't live without it, you're alcoholic.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3558s)

I just want to pause here for a second because the alcohol culture inside the PBCC right now is probably the worst it's ever been. So this is what I'm going to put out to you, everybody who listens to these, and we know so many inside are listening to these, right? If you cannot live without alcohol, you have a problem.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3583s)

Correct.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3585s)

I just want you guys to take that to heart. And this isn't scolding, this isn't telling anybody, oh, you're an alcoholic. I just want you to take that to heart and realize that it's an issue and that issue can be dealt with. You should not need alcohol to live.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3601s)

True. So he got away with it because he didn't put a quantity on it. At that time when those Aussies started to come to New Zealand, just a year or two prior to the Hales, that's when the drinking thing in New Zealand actually started to escalate. It was really the Aussies that came and pushed that, that seemed to just push the New Zealanders into thinking that it was okay.

And I know they used to say to my father, because being on the land, you have droughts and you have storms and you have floods and you have pests, so there's a reasonable amount of stress in running an orchard or whatever. And they would say to him, why don't you just go home, stop worrying about it, and just have a good hard scotch? I mean, that was brethren in a locality here saying that to him because they knew that he didn't [drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3665s) anything hardly.

And so, and one guy came, one brother came around one day and he said, oh, I said, if you have a lot of kids, he said, what would you do? And they're all rowing and rowing and whatnot. And this guy was a guy that drank a lot and didn't go anywhere, didn't do anything, just lived for the meetings and all the rest of it. So he'd stay home from the weekends and drink all the weekend. And Dad [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3695s), well, he said, what I'd do, he said, I'd buy a dinghy and I'd take them out for a row and let them enjoy creation, rather than stay home, drink whiskey, and then piddle it down the urinal.

I remember him saying that and I was thinking, you'll get yourself withdrawn from if you keep talking like that. But he just came straight out with it, and that was so right, that was so correct what he said. And fortunately, he never ever turned to drink. He never drank at all hardly. And I think we did cover it that I'd spoken to one of my family members in there about the young, and he said all they had to do, yeah, was to be able to drink. I thought, that's so sad. That's the potential of the whole church in those young teenagers and all they're being taught to do is to drink whiskey because they're not allowed to do anything else. [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3752s)

So sad. I mean, we were told that what we were doing back prior to '59 was the same as what we're doing now with our life and with our friends. Like at the bay, we'd go to a park out of town and maybe 10 families would go. We'd take a cricket ball in the back and some wickets and we'd have an evening meal out in the paddock and have a game of cricket. I mean, that's what life's all about. Or in the hot season, we'd go down and divide a couple of families and we'd go down to a beach and we'd have a swim. All that got knocked on the head.

We were told [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3788s) we were not to do those things and that if we went anywhere, we were not to take another family with us. That's the teaching when before I left. And then I was talking to somebody a few years ago, probably only five, six, seven years ago, and they said, oh, you know the Exclusive Brethren? I said, yeah, I do pretty well. They said, well, we met a group of them, we don't know whether it's them or not. We went to a beach for a swim, a lovely beach, and where I live here, and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3818s) came down for a swim and they all had a swim in black suit trousers and white shirts because they were not allowed to take any of their clothes off.

So they all went swimming in their meeting attire. Yeah, it looks so weird. I said, yeah, that's definitely them. Yeah, so funny little things that come up time to time. The other thing that we didn't talk about, and you might want to make a comment on the letter that Bruce sent back to me with his signature, with those famous words, "let the truth come out," and he underlined the word "truth" because nothing can hurt it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3869s)

So yeah, give a little background to this letter first.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3873s)

I worked on the idea that when you're looking for a problem with somebody, if you can get them to communicate with you, there's one chance in a hundred they might say something that they shouldn't, which exposes them. And that was my motive for writing this letter. And I think that's exactly what happened. He answered me back, which I appreciated, but he put those famous words in there about the truth and underlined [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3910s) word "truth."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3910s)

Yeah, I'm going to read this for the listeners. Okay, so this is dated October 19, 2004, and it's to Mr. Neville McCallum. This is from Bruce Hales himself. "Dear Neville, I acknowledge receipt of your postcard dated October 11th. Please note that this letter is in a fully enclosed sealed envelope. As far as I recall, I have not failed to read and to respond to your previous correspondence. You may recall following your first letter, I attempted to speak to you [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3940s) the phone. I think you were away on holidays."

"I note your use of the word 'warning' twice. Beloved brother (and in brackets it says 'in fellowship or out of fellowship'), your present position has certainly not resulted from my hands. As to the truth (and it's underlined) coming out, let it. One is never afraid of the truth and can never do anything against it. See 2 Corinthians 13 verse 8\. I have forwarded your correspondence [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=3971s) a brother in New Zealand in whom I have confidence for follow-up."

"I am sorry I have not sent a postcard. I have none so pretty as yours near at hand to send you. I appreciate your comments as to my health. It is improving somewhat under the mercy of the Lord's hand and goodness and trust will improve further. Yet I must finish that if you were back in fellowship, and there is only one fellowship (read JND and JBS to confirm this), with the saints of God to whom you belong, then it would be a lot easier to be in contact with you [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4001s) help you. I was in the west of New Zealand past August. Affectionately (at a distance) in Christ, Bruce Hales."

So when I read this letter, I was like, okay, he says it right then and there, let the truth come out. That is what this podcast is all about, is everybody's truth coming out, right? He says it [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4031s) then, right there, bold, black and white, let it come out. So every single one of you that has been sitting on the fence of coming forward, that letter gives you permission to come out. Bruce Hales says it, let the truth come out. That's what we're doing.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4047s)

We're actually obeying him.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4051s)

We are, we're taking instructions from the man of God.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4055s)

I couldn't believe it when I read it. I thought, how can you write that in the letter in the face of the postcards I was sending him about child molestation and everything else, where he was deliberately trying to stop it, threatening to sue me and put big, hefty, 20-something stone McCorkell on to me for a vicious meeting in Wellington to cover it all up, in the face of that letter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4084s)

I just don't understand. I mean, I do understand. I understand the business side of things and that's how they view their congregation. It's just a business, right? In the presentation of a Christian church. But with everything that is coming at them, and I've said this in many podcasts, I just don't understand how those people can follow him, talk about how he's got this [compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4114s), he's got this and he's, you know, this just ball of love and light.

When we are putting out podcast number 96, 97 at this point in time, and not one of us has had that compassion come our way. Nobody has come forward and sat down with us and said, let's talk. Like, you have got to understand that the words that he speaks are absolute, pardon my French, [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4145s)? Like, you have got to understand that he does not walk his talk.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4149s)

Sure, no. So he's just written down what is right to cover himself but then doesn't practice it. And anybody from inside should be able to see that so easily. Yes. So we'll hang on to that letter. There might be more mileage in it yet. Oh, I'm sure there will be. Yeah. I think the only thing we haven't said anything [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4180s) there is probably the postcards, which had an electrifying effect, as I think I said. And one of the, I think I might have written it down, that I couldn't get anybody to reply to me.

That's how I got that letter from Bruce Hales you've just read, because he mentioned his postcard in that letter. Yeah. And I tried at first putting them in envelopes so all the gory details of child molestation and whatnot was covered up, and they still didn't come back to me. I thought, well, how about I leave it out of the envelope so the postie can read it and everybody else? And man, it was like sending [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4226s) scud missile onto his office, I think, because I got a response straight away. And then he wouldn't do anything about the whole situation, which I was pleading with him on the postcards to do, which I sent you a copy of the postcards. And so finally, of course, he threatened to sue me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4247s)

So these are copies of the postcards. I'll add these all into a folder in the description of this podcast for everybody to read. Yeah. So what I'm going to do is I'm not going to go through and read these. So these are all Neville's postcards to Bruce, and I am going to include them at the end of the podcast and you guys can just go through them at your own time. Actually, I'm going to read this one. This is the fourth one.

"Dear Bruce, in fairness, you should have replied to my sealed letter [dated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4278s) 18/05/05, hence this card. Because you chose not to meet with and others to discuss the pending TV documentary, further damage to withdrawn-from Christians occurred on New Zealand TV. Alan Davis's testimony was defamatory and untrue, which could result in repercussions, compensation beyond your control. Some New Zealand brethren want this matter settled, but Alan Davis will not cooperate. Is there part of you that I could appeal to before I take the next step? Surely Alan Davis is not still your trusted man, [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4308s) he still an Exclusive Brethren priest? Bruce, you have not answered nor met with me over the possibility of one, the brethren being deceived by lies and corruption of Aberdeen. Two, child molestation, police have been approached, etc. More to follow. Three, please inquire into brethren activities. Four, wrongful workplace dismissals, etc., etc. You could come forward and still be held in honor. Neville McCallum."

You just touched on all the subjects in just that one postcard that gets us going on [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4338s) podcasts.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4340s)

Then he threatened to sue me, of course, through that card in there for Wiseman. He threatened to sue me on behalf of Bruce because of all the lies and the misrepresentations, a whole list of things that were wrong. So I sent a card back to him or a letter back and I included a Twink pen, or a, you know, a pen you cross out words with, I don't know what you call them. Like a White-Out. Yeah, White-Out. Yeah, I sent him a White-Out pen and told him to to highlight all the things in my letter that were, as they said, wrong, so that I could apologize and put it right. Otherwise, could you please mail my brand new Twink pen back to me? And guess what? I never got the pen back or anything else.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4401s)

Of course you didn't.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4401s)

Take that. Yeah, take that. But the cards really work because, and that's why on one of them, to ID Bruce and to bring him out, I put "Leader of the Exclusive Brethren" on the top of the postcard so that he couldn't conceal himself as being anybody else.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4420s)

Well, you've given us like a lot of tools here for many people who are trying to reach him. So note taken, open postcards.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4430s)

That's why I say on the bottom of one of those postcards or the bottom of the letter to you, I said it would be good if everybody, hundreds of people, all emailed Bruce on open postcards, pretty little things, because everybody reads them. Yeah. So that that was a bit of fun. That was a bit, yeah. The Petrie and McLean cases [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4461s) both court cases that went through the court, so they were public. And Petrie went away for a couple of years. He's since passed on. I can't remember, I think McLean went down as well because we know his wife very well. But I was involved in that case too on behalf of his wife, and I finished up meeting with the police in the North Island where they were local.

And the police guy was very, very good, very helpful, very supportive, couldn't have met a better guy. And we got talking about the brethren and what he thought of them and how the fact that the brethren were supporting a guy who was proven in court to be a rapist, and they got rid of his wife and supported him. I talked to the police about it and he said, well, we've seen things with Exclusive Brethren that are way outside the square. You couldn't trust what they were going to do.

I said, give me an example. And he said they came into that area because they were surveilling somebody for drug trafficking, but the neighbor of this house they were doing a standover on was Exclusive Brethren. And he said, we're standing out on the street, not on brethren property. And the owner of the property came out and said, what are you doing here? And he said, we told him that for a start, we're minding our own business and we had a perfect right to be standing here. And he said, well, he needed to know what we were doing here and he wasn't happy with us there. And he said we weren't even on his property or looking at his property.

 [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4570s) he went away and he said, all of a sudden, within 10 minutes, the street just filled with racing cars, racing and tires squealing up to us, confronting us. And he said, there's three or four or five officers standing on the footpath doing surveillance on this house. And he said, so we got in our cars and we drove away. And I said to him, what, you're the police and you buckled to these criminals? And he said, we feared mass violence. Wow. To de-escalate it, we left the scene and they shadowed us behind us. They shadowed us for miles and miles before they gave up the chase. He said, that's how far they'll go. That's pretty serious stuff. Unbelievable. No respect for the police whatsoever.

And the other police that spoke to me were in my little port where we put our boats and whatnot, just a small place. Talking to them one day about the brethren and he said, oh, he said, the best day on our beat is when the brethren are on their interchange. I said, yeah, you got 20 cars, one in a, and they're all drunk, aren't they? He said, you won't believe it, but he said, we can't work it out. And I don't understand this. He said, every time [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4662s) blow into our mouthpiece, you know, for an alcohol test, yeah, they wreck our analyzers, the little machine, the breathalyzer. Yeah, breathalyzer, they wreck it.

He said, we don't know whether they're drinking lemon before they breathe into it or a pill they take or what. He said, we've even sent our breathalyzers back to the factory to get them analysed to see what are they breathing into [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4692s) breathalyzers that's wrecking them. And he said, they can't even work it out in the production factory what they're blowing into them that's killing them. Wow. So he said, never ever trust an Exclusive Brethren. This is coming from the police. And I'm thinking, this is my hometown. Yeah, some of these people are my own, my own sister lives in this town. I've never spoken to her except in the review for 40 years. This is what he's saying about my family. This is really bad.

The other interesting one I had with the police was Sydney. And there was a case there probably, I don't know, 10 years ago, where they thought a woman reporter was taking photographs of their hall or something. So they chased her and it got so bad, several cars, that she called out for help and an opposition media company opened their road gates and let her into their yard to protect her. That's how bad it got. And I thought, [I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4765s) like to speak to the policeman who did that.

Then I thought, hang on a minute, there's probably 500 police stations in Sydney. There's probably, I don't know, 5,000, 8,000 policemen. They're only on for an eight-hour shift and then they're off. So you only get a third of those in a police station at any one time. And I thought, no, I'm not going to, I don't normally give up easy. So no, I'm going to put a call through. So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4796s) got, went to directory, they gave me the number and they said, which police station do you want? I said, wouldn't have a clue, just put me to a police station.

So they just pressed the button. I got a police station, told them the case, I want to speak to a constable. And would you believe it, he said, I'm the man who handled it. You wouldn't believe it. Out of thousands of policemen and hundreds of police stations, I got the guy who handled it on the first call.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4823s)

Oh, I love it. Wow.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4827s)

I couldn't, I was speechless because I thought I'd have to go through half a dozen toll calls to Sydney and try and work through it and maybe a month before I got the guy. And there he was. And then I thought, he's not going to tell me anything. I could have been a spy for the Exclusive Brethren trying to sort him out. So I thought, how can I give him confidence in me? So I told him who I was. I told him that [I'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4857s) written those 900 homes and 600 homes. Told him I was working not against the brethren but to try and enlighten them or whatever.

And that's the reason for my call, because I'd like to discuss them too, because my family are in there. And he opened up and told me the lot. I couldn't believe it. I still could have been a spy. So I think he actually went beyond what his trade would have [advised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4887s) him to do. So he sent the whole case out for me. He said, when we caught these cars, they all had mobile phones and they were all totally wrecked beyond recognition or beyond getting anything off them. They'd all wrecked their mobile phones, crushed them. They all had radio contact installed within the car so they could talk to each other.

And when we took them in for a briefing, they pulled out a paper bag and $12,000 Australian dollars rolled out onto the table. And he said, do you think we'll see that again? And he said, that piece of speech is done in a way that we cannot go them for bribery. Will I see that money again? You see, they had, and then he said, we went to the other two cars and they had a paper bag in each with $12,000 Australian dollars ready to bribe the police with whenever they got caught. [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4967s) That came straight from the police officer that handled the case. Unbelievable. It is really, it is really, it's mafia.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4975s)

Oh, 100%, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=4977s)

Yeah. So when I read the story of your other business partner from England that's on the podcast with you, Richard, yeah, Richard Marsh. Yeah. When I heard the case through that private investigator, which was an amazing podcast, of how he'd been tracked and how he was to be done away with and other things, I related myself back to these things that I'd [found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5008s) out, where I reckon they were in the mafia too. So I was able to believe what they said on that podcast without questioning how bad this thing is. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5017s)

Yeah, you know, there's actually a, it's from a UBT seminar, and I'll insert it here, where Bruce actually refers to them as a mafia. I don't have it on me right now, but I will insert it in here. And okay, it is, they definitely run themselves like a mafia. They are ruthless, absolutely ruthless. Yeah, yep, yep. It's their way or the [highway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5048s) and they don't care how they get their way.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5050s)

Correct.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5051s)

And I've said this to my lead investigator and to my case myself, is that they don't care. They all lie for each other. Their whole job is to protect themselves, their ecosystem, their truth, whatever it is that they believe, they all protect it. And that includes lying on the stand, that includes lying to police. I don't like, I know when these police end up showing up [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5081s) Maple Creek or, you know, I don't expect any of them to tell the truth. I mean, I would hope that my parents' love for me would outweigh their love for the assembly and what they're in, but I don't hold my breath on it.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5096s)

No, no. And I think that side of it has gone too far to recover. Exactly. Yeah, I think it's a start again from the beginning, prior to '59, and build it up as a bona fide church. It's got no mandate to be a church, none whatsoever. And that's why I've pledged with the Royal Commission, you've got to take their charitable status off them so [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5126s) it breaks them. And I said, if you did that, our families would be rejoined again. Exactly.

I said, if you did that, I said, it would be the greatest thing that's ever happened for 50,000 people. Yep. Because where there's no gospel, and I put them, put in a book in writing, Bruce Hales is probably leading 40,000 people towards the gates of hell. Yeah, I agree. And I firmly believe that. Yeah, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5157s) people have been asked, friends of mine have asked young people about their confession of faith and a born-again experience like I had. I can remember where I was, what the room looked like, what the tree was like outside. That's just in my vision from 70 years ago as if it was yesterday.

You know, I had an experience and I never give up on it. But you talk to them and they say, well, no, being a member of the Exclusive Brethren, we've got life eternal. No, I'm sorry, you have not. It doesn't come like that. Yeah, you're going the wrong way. [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5187s) Yeah. The McCorkell attack, it was a very vicious attack on Peter Harrison and me. And we had to work our way through it because they wanted to get their hands on the women who'd been abused.

And I'd followed other cases and saw what they did. He would get his hands on them, they would pay them money or they would terrify them for what they were going to have to face in the court case so that they stopped [complaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5218s). Very much like some of the podcasts you've done, they start blaming the victim. And he so desperately wanted the four names out of me for the Petrie case. Bruce Hales sent him over from Sydney to have a meeting with me. And I got on the ferry and went to the next city in the other island and had a meeting with him.

And I wouldn't give him the information that he wanted. And he said, well, I haven't come all the way here from [Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5248s), he said, to go home with nothing. And I said, well, we'll give you what we want to give you, because you're not getting the names of the four women. And then I thought I'd test him out, and he was getting madder and madder. So I said, well, what we'll do is, I think I might have touched on it earlier, I said, if you will allow us, and I'll put this to the women, I think they would agree, I will bring them to the meeting in Nelson, which is a neighboring [city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5281s) to us here.

I will bring the four women, get the brethren to put on an assembly meeting with the culprit in the room. Oh. And if he will apologize to those four women in a meeting with all the brethren, not just the priests, this has got to be, this confession has got to be carried by all the brethren, not just the priests. Yeah. So I will bring them, I'll come in with them, I'll be in the meeting too, and we'll listen to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5311s) culprit go over his history with these four women and apologize, and they will forgive them. There will be no court case.

I can see him now, he was so mad because he realized he was between a rock and a hard place. I'd offered the names, I'd offered to bring the women, you couldn't have asked for anything more than that. But he had to get agreement from the brethren in Nelson, which could have shot him down. And he, I don't know whether you know him, but he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5341s) a huge guy. He was like six foot three, 24 stone or something, he was absolutely massive. And he jumped up, he was so mad, he jumped up out of his chair and shot the chair back with the back of his legs and went across the conference room. It literally went two meters out the back behind. He got up, he was so mad.

But he realized I'd offered him something that now he had to decide whether he would accept it or not. [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5372s) He gets on the phone, then he rings McNaughton in Sydney, who was about the next under Hales at the time. And I'm listening to the conversation and he comes off the phone and said, we've agreed to it. McNaughton's agreed to it. I thought, this is going to be interesting, I'm back in the meeting again. And the girls, honestly, the women would have rather have had a confession than go to court. They told me that. They would accept that if only he would apologize. Wow.

But the fact [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5402s) saying he never did it, we're going to court. So I said, okay, well, you ring the Nelson brethren then and you get the okay to put on an assembly meeting with all the brethren. I'll get the women together and we'll come and have a chat. And he came back and said, the Nelson brethren wouldn't agree. And that's what I pinged on that guy Smith that I chased out of the courtroom when I stopped him when he was running into the car park. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5432s) said, Bruce Hales is going to withdraw from you then. When he wheeled around, I said, well, what for? I said, because you disagreed to me bringing the women into your locality and that's why we're in a court here today, because you withstood McCorkell and McNaughton, which means you withstood Bruce Hales. Yeah.

I didn't know whether he did or not, but it scared the daylights out of him anyway. So that's how that ended. And then afterwards, [Prime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5463s) Time TV for the next three nights, two nights or three nights, was all on the McCorkell covering up child sex cases. And the brethren turned around and blamed me. And I said, I didn't call the media in. And when I walked out of that meeting with McCorkell and went into the foyer to leave, I ran into the TV that had done our documentary. And I said hello to them all because I knew them. And I thought, McCorkell's got the media here right on top of this meeting with me.

And what he'd done, he'd got the media to come in for primetime TV to offset what I was saying to him about the four women so they could get it out into the public immediately. Wow. And I got a ring from an old man who I knew well, who was friends with my father, who I respected, and he phoned me. He said, Neville, what did you call the media in for to hang one on the brethren? I said, I didn't do it. He said, well, who did it? I said, your Bruce Hales' damage control officer, he did it. The very person we were talking to trying to solve the problem, he had the media waiting in the foyer when I walked out. I'd never spoken to the media.

Did he believe you? So I said, your man got it on prime time TV. I didn't. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5560s) all he said was, those leaders, my leaders have lied to me and I'm not happy about this. I said, George, you imagine if everybody said that. Yeah. I said, you'd pull the brethren straight.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5576s)

Right, right there is what people need to do in the heat of moments, right, is stand up.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5583s)

Correct. That's what he could have done. And he could have gone back, but he would have got withdrawn from for supporting himself. So, yeah, so that was, had a very interesting end to it. The end was it had to go to court and he went to jail for two years, but it had a pretty rough ride to get there, but we won.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5606s)

Yeah, and I'll touch, I think there's a lot of articles to that. I'll attach all the articles in this podcast towards that case. Yes.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5614s)

Yeah, I'll find them. I'll find them, pages and pages on the McCorkell. I just sent you one letter so that you had something about McCorkell. Yeah. And then he turned on me and said a whole lot of slanderous things about me. So I threatened him with defamation, sent him a letter, got my lawyer to write to him and threatening defamation and bring him to a New Zealand court. I never heard another nasty word. So he took that seriously. So, [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5645s) and games.

So, just on the last topic here, the contacts that I've had with members of the brethren. We've had meetings in my lounge, of course, which didn't come to anything, but very respectful meetings. I will never argue. I've never ever argued, ever, no matter what anybody says to me. I will never argue because you lose your position, you lose power when you argue. So never argue with the brethren.

But I had one person wanted to come and see me and tell me some things inside. And he came and was in Nelson. So I took him to [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5686s) fruit grower's place who I knew, the person on neutral ground where no EBs would be, and parked his car in there. But all, and I had about an hour with him, but all the time, honestly, with every half a minute, he'd be looking at me and talking to me and then he'd look out like that. And that was the road where an EB vehicle might have come up the driveway or something. And that's why he was just, he was just petrified the whole time that he [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5716s) get caught. Not going to mention his name because he's still in there. Yeah, of course.

And then that other person who spoke to me, the older man. And then I met another person, this is quite an interesting one. When we had the review, I got asked around, Pip and I got invited around to my sister's place to meet them for the first time in the review, which was after 20 years, was quite a thing. And we get in there and their daughters[\-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5746s)\-law and husbands were there. So we met those who had married my nephews. And got on with them well.

And my son and his family were with us to meet his auntie. And when we went home, we spoke to my daughter-in-law and said, well, what do you think about that, going to an exclusive home for an hour and chatting and whatnot? And the servery, I mean, about that length of the servery was just covered with bottles of spirits like whiskey and everything. There was just top-shelf stuff there, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5784s) a lot of little babies and kids running around. And she said, I think I'll join. We said, you what? She said, well, if all you do is drink whiskey and make babies, she said, I'm in. Anyway, we had to talk to them.

Several years later, I was away out on an outlying island off the South Island building a jetty, and I had my boat that had my name on it down the side. And I saw this helicopter come in and three or four guys get out of it. And one after a while walked down where I was working along the beach. And I went to go in there with the boat to pick up something. And as I got closer and closer, when I was five or six meters away, I thought, I reckon I've seen that guy [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5831s). White shirt, black trousers, that tells you, doesn't it?

And I thought, I reckon I've met this guy before. And as my boat hit the beach and stopped, I saw him lean out to the side and read the signage, my business signage on the side of the boat. And it had N and D McCallum because my son's Duncan. And he looked up at me and I looked up at him and his jaw dropped a bit and he was just eyeballing [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5861s) at about four meters. I thought, well, I'd go and have a chat with him.

So he got off, and of course, being away out on the outlying island, no brethren can ever catch you. Yeah. So he opened up. I mean, this proves it's wrong. You should be able to do this in the brethren, not only outside of the brethren. And he said to me, you know, you were on medication once for muscle relaxant. It was when I had this pinched nerve, trying to relax the muscles. And he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5891s), it helped your headaches. I said, yeah, quite a long while back, but yep. He said, would you mind telling me what it was?

I thought, that's a weird question to ask way out on an outlying island. I thought, no, I'm going to dig a bit deeper here. And I said, well, what do you want it for? I thought, you know, just started down the rabbit hole. What do you want it for? And he said, well, it's for my wife, who was my niece, and she gets really, really bad headaches. [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5921s) I often wondered if we could get onto the tablets you were on, it might help her. And I thought, no, we just need to go down the rabbit hole a bit further.

So I said, well, the first thing you do is you don't take drugs. You find out what's doing it and you work from there back to the drugs. So I said, tell me what's causing it. And I couldn't believe what he said. Oh, he said, it's these jolly breaks when 20 people [walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5952s) in and she's got to do all the meals and the catering. And he just flew off about the breaks. I said, well, you know where you start. You don't have any more visitors. That's where you start. And if that doesn't work, then you go on to the medication. So I said, you've got to go to the root cause first.

And so I did, I had to go back to my doctor, go back through my history to find out what the tablet was. I went to a wee bit of trouble for [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=5982s). And I said, give me a guarantee that if I tell you what this is, you will always promise to ring me back and tell me whether it helped my niece. And he said, yes, I will. So I gave him the prescription. He's never, ever, ever rung me back. Oh, now that's, that's dirty business. Yeah, it's really dirty business. That's sad. Yeah. But I thought my advice to him was correct. Stop [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6012s) breaks.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6012s)

Yeah, those poor women and what they go through and what they go through now. Like these last, you know, five, ten years, it's just ridiculous because it's not back when I was in, right? It wasn't this massive, it's like the king and queen are coming every Sunday, right? It's what the displays they put on now, I've seen pictures of them, are just crazy, so outlandish.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6037s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6039s)

Yes, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work for all those females in there and it's a big cost too, such a big cost. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6046s)

We went to a break in the neighboring place where we went every week and a pretty arrogant brother there that tried to get into the hierarchy and he couldn't, so he still sort of wanted to throw his weight around. And I was on this medication for my neck before my fusion and I wasn't supposed to drink alcohol. Came to the break and there were probably 15 or more people in the room and he went around everybody and then he came to me and I thought, now [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6076s) am I going to do? And he said, oh, whiskey on the rocks for you, Nev. I said, no, milk to tea ratio, whiskey on the bottom, lemonade on the top.

I didn't tell him for the medication because I was against the drinking anyway and most people knew it. So I've taken a heck of a risk to say that. And he looked at me and he said, if you can't take it on the rocks, you are not a man. Wow. He just went glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, filled my glass up and had the arrogance to walk across the room in front of 20 people and drop it on my chair. And I thought, no, I'll be a bigger bully than him. So I got up in front of everybody. I walked back over to his cocktail cabinet. I put it back on the cocktail cabinet, got another glass, put that much whiskey in the bottom of it, put some ice in it, filled it up with lemonade, and went and sat down and folded my arms just to say, righto, well, let's have it out with you.

Never said a word, and I got away with it. I expected a priestly when I got home. And he took it and said nothing. So that's what you had to do. If I tried to negotiate and say, no, look, I can't drink this, it would have all started again. You know, better just to walk up, dump it, get another one and go back, and it works. So the drinking thing was quite an issue for me. I was really against it.

I had one more visit, I won't say which locality, where I heard a friend of mine, an old motorbike and hunting pal of mine, had become a leader. I thought, oh, well, people like me can become leaders, can they? I'd like to have a chat with my old friend. This is 30 years after we'd been withdrawn from. So I got in my car and I drove to that city in the South Island. I knew brethren lived in the street, so I parked my car way out, put on a funny hat, I walked into the street and I watched the brethren come home from the meeting so I knew which houses that were within eyeball sight of him were Exclusive Brethren.

And then I waited for another hour or more, hour and a half in the street until most of the lights went out, which meant they'd gone to bed. And then I felt it was safe to go into my friend's house because fortunately his light hadn't gone out. So I went to the front door, knocked on it, met him for the first time in 30 years and he's a leader. Told him what I'd come for, told him I wasn't against him. He would have got some of those letters that I sent. Yeah. And at the end of the conversation, I'll just touch on one thing.

At the end of the conversation, he said to me, this is how honest he was, but took a massive risk. He said, we have done so much damage in this country, we will never ever be able to put it right. And he said, I feel we will probably need to come to you people on the outside for help. You just have a think about that, out of a leader's mouth. I could have rung up another leader in that city and potted him and he would have been withdrawn from within a week. So that's how much he trusted me after 30 years, that he would actually make that final comment that we will need to come back to you out for help.

So it shows what some of the mindset is in there. It's not what it looks like on the outside. I think there is something there that we could appeal to if only they will sit down and [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6316s), let's wipe the slate clean and let's have a chat. And that's what I've put in my letter to the local brethren here. They're going to get it this week. Why don't we do what scripture says and sit down and reason together and search the scriptures to see if these things are so? That's in the letter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6336s)

You know, it's just like for me, I do not hate these people. It's just like, I want, let's gather our compassion for everybody in the situation that we're in. I mean, we're going back how many years, right? We're going back pre, what did you say, '60, '59, separation was brought in, right? Do you think of how many years that we have been dealing with this cultivated soup of power and greed and money that there is [not one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6367s) person to blame, right?

Let's take blame aside, put that aside, because I really feel that that's what they feel all of us opposers are doing. I don't blame anybody. But what I want is, there is a way out of this. There is a way through this. But the more that Bruce resists and the more that people can't, I'm very inspired by the backbone that you've had. And I'm hoping a ton of these people that have one foot in and one foot out [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6398s) this backbone that you're presenting here, that it is okay to say no to certain things. It is okay to stand up to certain people because it doesn't come out of malice. This is all coming, if we all come from a place of compassion, things can change.

The one preaching, and I've said this in another podcast, the one preaching my Dad gave that I'll never forget, he actually got into trouble for it, was he gave this preaching about compassion. He was in tears in it. I will never forget it because if Bruce was truly this full-fledged Christian soldier, I'm not going to call him a man of God because I can't, if he truly was this walking [breath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6445s) of Christianity, he would not be doing what he's doing. He would not be closing a blind eye to 96 podcasts of heartache. He just wouldn't.

I just, I guess like those are the things that keep me up at night. It's why I cry. Like, I am a crier, most people who know me know that. And that's what I cry for. I cry because this could be so easily addressed. Yeah. And it just breaks my heart. It [breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6475s) my heart to know that there was a moment in time way back when that was not looked at and another path was taken, which has led us to the mess that we're in now. And I believe that we're at a crucial, crucial pivotal moment.

I believe Bruce Hales is sitting at a crossroads where he has the opportunity to create change or to create disaster. And from what I feel and what we're seeing from inside there, he's [choosing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6506s) the path of disaster. So this does not come on any of us who are choosing to speak the truth. This lands on Bruce Hales' lap because he is the one that is choosing to hold this power. He is the one that's saying he has this power, yet he is choosing a path of destruction.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6524s)

Yep. I go back to the basics like you're saying and I grieve over the fact that I was in there when the Lord was head of the assembly. Yeah. Now I don't believe he's there. No, not at all. He can be with individual souls, but corporally or in an assembly situation, he's not there anymore. No, but he used to be. And that's a great [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6554s) any Christian.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6556s)

And you know, I plead to those people inside that know that it's not right, that if you are fearful of churches out here, I guarantee you you will find what matches you. I guarantee it. Absolutely. You have hundreds to choose from. You will find what you're looking for, but what you're looking for does not exist inside the PBCC.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6583s)

No, it doesn't. No, no. Yeah, we had a visit here from somebody in the North Island, brought here and hid his car. He wanted to see me for a while. And he said that he told me how he was converted. And he was a leader in a small locality in the North Island. And he was asked to give a word, I won't say [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6613s) because I don't want them to trace him, but he gave a word at the end of three-day meetings, which is quite an honor. And he said, we need to have more meetings about Jesus.

He was visited within two days with priests taking him to task over what he had said. And he said, I pled with them, but it just fell on deaf ears. So he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6643s), I conveyed to him how I'd been converted. And he told me, and he said, I might as well have told them I'd been for a ride on a horse. They took absolutely no interest in it. They did not know what I was talking about. And he said, I suddenly realized that virtually all my friends that I work with in my locality at the priest level are not saved souls. And he said, I've never got over it. So, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6676s)

It's so hard when we know we have family in there, right? Like my family are good people. My Dad is such a heartfelt man. My mom is so caring. And I think that's why I do what I do. I will not stop. I won't stop until I know I can't do anymore. I just, it's just, I won't. And so I'm very grateful to have reached out to you and you have reached out to me to be able to sit in front of yourself who has started [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6706s) how many years ago.

And I do, I feel like we just are riding in on those flames that you started. Jill Mytton had started, like these, your generation that tried this so many, so many years ago, right? Where social media is on our side this time. I do believe social media has really been able to be the reason why we have been able to do what we do now. I am very grateful to hear and learn of all [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6736s) work that you have done. Yeah. Thank you so, so much Neville.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6743s)

Glad to support you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6744s)

And just enlightening us all with what really went on all those years ago and all the work you have done. My bucket is so full tonight. It's so full. I'm just so grateful. Thank you, thank you so much.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6761s)

Thank you for supporting it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW53TlwEWcU&t=6763s)

Yeah. Okay everyone, until next time, everyone take care. Much love to everyone. Bye-bye.

Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
