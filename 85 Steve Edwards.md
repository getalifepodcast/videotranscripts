### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts. Leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=58s)

Good evening, everybody. Welcome to the Get A Life podcast. I'm here with my friend Anne and Ross who you've met before and our special guest with us this evening is Steve Edwards. Steve left the Brethren a few years back and I'm going to open the floor and Steve, start at the beginning and tell us your story.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dt0MhKZwa-Uc%26t%3D78s)

Thanks Jacky. So if I start at the beginning, my childhood, I had a pretty normal childhood. The funny thing about the Brethren is you listen to different people and we were all brought up a little bit differently. Different meetings had different standards and some were relatively strict, some were relatively free, and some had a reputation for being too free.

Where I grew up in the High Wycombe area it wasn't too bad. As a kid when I lived in Marlow, I lived [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=127s) near the river and I used to come and go. Even as a little child on my tricycle, I would cycle down to the town center and high street. And growing up, I was free to come and go. I always thought my parents were too strict because I had another local family who had more freedom and they had [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=157s) that I didn't have that I wanted but wasn't allowed.

Looking back at it, it was okay. You know, everyone's got their stuff. We had another family that moved away, a boy who was a few years older than me, and I was sexually abused by him. Nothing too serious, but it's there. I was terrified of that guy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=190s)

How old were you at that sort of stage when that went on? Were you sort of under 10?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=196s)

I was probably, I don't know. There's only two instances I remember. One I would have been about seven or eight and the other one I was a bit older. He came to stay with us and he was sleeping in my bedroom, and I was, I don't know, maybe 10 or something that time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=230s)

A child.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=231s)

Yeah, a child. Yeah. When I was seven, it seems ridiculous, he made me climb up a very high tree in a local park, what seemed high when I was seven, stuck a cigarette in my mouth and said, "smoke this or I'm going to push you off."

That didn't kill me, I was just terrified of the bloke, he was a bully. But yeah, I don't want to dwell on that, it's not that big a deal. It wasn't nice. I had three sisters, so I was the only boy, so I wasn't into football or anything like that. I was more into playing with trains and stamp collections. I'm very close to my mum, I was a mummy's boy and my mum was a very godly woman and she gave me a real love of the scriptures, the Bible.

She taught me that, and that's my experience, that Jesus was my best friend as a kid and that's how I grew up. But I had kids around me and so we got up to tricks as well, the usual sort of boy stuff. You know, didn't always pay for our sweets at the sweet shop and whatever, all sorts. At school, obviously, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=338s) the usual discrimination. We wouldn't go into assembly and all of that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=342s)

So sorry to interrupt, presumably you went to a mainstream school? Because like me, in our youth there wasn't OneSchool Global, was there? So we were in a normal school.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=353s)

Yes, in the infant and then junior school there were quite a few Brethren kids around. But I then went to a grammar school and I was the first Brethren boy, it was a boys only school, I was the first Brethren boy to have been there for, I don't know, about 25 years. So it was uncharted ground essentially, and that wasn't fun.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=383s) still wanted to be one of the lads, so I was the first boy at school to wear Doc Martens to school. It's just a little story, they used to call me Buddha because I stayed out of the morning prayers and all of that, and then my name became known as Buddha in Boots.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=406s)

Careful, that might stick Steve.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=412s)

Yeah, that was different and there was the usual, you know, I had hassles at school and all that, but some of it definitely generated by being in the Brethren, I was different. I hated school, I hated it, and I was so glad that I could leave when I was 16, even though the head wanted me to stay on and do A-levels and go to uni, which of course now I wish I had done. But I was [desperate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=442s) to get into the family business, so I had a job waiting for me which I did. At the age of 16, I was put on a train up to the West End of London to go selling, which for a 16-year-old is possibly, you know...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=459s)

How much of that desperation to leave school... I mean, school was an uncomfortable place when you were the only Brethren person in a large school, but how much of that desperation to leave school do you think may have been influenced by the environment you were in? A-levels and university were not an option anyway, you would never be encouraged down that route, would you?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=486s)

No, it's 100%. I mean, I did an essay once about it, I don't know what my English master thought, but the sort of theory was that you're far better to leave school at 16 and get on and work your way up and earn money rather than stay on two or three years at uni and start much later. Very much the Brethren mindset.

So yeah, being a little rebel, my mum would drop me off at the railway station and I'd pop into the kiosk and buy The Sun and a packet of cigarettes just to be really cool. I hated smoking, [hated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=538s) it, and I couldn't do it, but I did try, but I just couldn't bear it.

I was thrust out there and as soon as I could drive I was given a vehicle and I was out and about traveling the country. Besides the sales, I had a lot of freedom, which maybe isn't actually that good for a 17-year-old. You need a bit of discipline, I think everyone needs a bit of discipline at that age, a bit of structure, and I didn't really have any. Just go out, get orders, come back. I did all right, business was good, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=580s) that was fine.

In between, I was doing dreadful stuff. I might stop off at a pub for lunch, and the first time I went to a pub in Watford, I got parked across the road and I reversed my car in so that I could make a quick getaway in case there was a big fight in the pub, because you know, pubs...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=601s)

Which pub was that Steve, from Watford? Can you remember?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=607s)

It's in North Watford somewhere.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=608s)

It may not be there now anyway.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=610s)

I was really nervous going to this pub. Of course, there was hardly anybody in there and I had a time to reach for 50p or whatever it was. And yeah, then I would get a pub lunch sometimes. And of course, the other thing was I got pre-recorded tapes, listened to music. And I would buy wicked magazines like True Detective or something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=643s)

I just wondered what you were going to say there for a minute, Steve.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=651s)

Yeah. That did come later. But yeah, it was a lot of harmless stuff. I would stay away at a lot of places overnight. I'd stay with other Brethren in other places and over the sort of three, four year period before I was married, I did that. I'd stay for weekends and I enjoyed a good time and I tended to stay with the more lively element, you might say.

Unfortunately, I did get some reports [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=685s) to the local leader at Wycombe that my presence wasn't always totally appreciated. One time at the ski slope, you know, and although someone took me there, apparently it was my bad influence that we went to this ski slope. We went to a fairground down at Plymouth once. I didn't know it was there, I was taken. I was very [happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=715s) to go along, but you know, it's not the sort of thing we did. I'm going to come to a bit more about that later.

When I was 11, my dad had been to three-day meetings with Mr. Symington at Coventry. He came to where I'd been staying for the weekend and he was telling the family there all about it. One thing Mr. Symington had said was that the rapture was going to come within 10 years.

As an 11-year-old boy, I knew I had to get married by the time I was 21 if I wanted to do what every boy wants to do. That was my sort of a big priority in my life. And so I did, I got married at 21 and four days.

Even the dating, I mean, my dating was completely different to yours. It was my little sister's best friend initially. I picked her up from school when she was 15 and just dropped her off home and her mum was quite happy. Then we'd go out for a walk, and then she came to us for the day, and we even went out for days on our own with parents quite happy about it.

Nothing untoward happened actually, which just shows how terrified we were of consequences. Because it was only like a year or two before had been the seven-day matter, when people had been withdrawn from for a minimum of seven days for [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=852s) fornication, adultery or unclean handling. And so, yeah, we were absolutely terrified of being tarred with that brush.

So yeah, we got married. Kids came quickly as they did. And working in the family business, we were doing all right. Wasn't making loads of money but we were okay. We had two little boys, very close together, 15 months apart. We would do terrible things like take them swimming to the local swimming pool, which they absolutely loved. It was great, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=907s) of course, it was like, you mustn't say anything to anybody.

I remember one time, when they banned going to beaches, we went to West Wittering for the day on the Saturday. The following day we were meant to be going out for Sunday dinner and we just cancelled because we were terrified the boys were going to say, "Oh, we went to the sea yesterday."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=933s)

You just had a family day out at the seaside. When you look back, yeah, but we understand that fear. When you're in it, the fear is just, isn't it?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=943s)

It's just not worth getting caught.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=946s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=946s)

So yeah, so we just had to feign sickness. But then, our second boy, he had a brain tumor. After 10 months and having had radiotherapy treatment, there was nothing else they could do and he passed, which was a really tough period of time. But you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=976s), at that point, previous to that, I had been having my doubts about God and all that, and that actually gave me a lot of clarity.

One particular day, I remember our little boy had had a brain scan, and this was about four months in, and we were waiting for the results. Waiting and not knowing is excruciatingly painful. I was just going around and I literally felt I was going to explode. I thought I was going to have a breakdown or something. The pressure was so great I just hardly knew how to cope.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1034s) could tell you the spot on a roundabout in London I was going around and the thought came to my mind, it's a scripture in Isaiah, I couldn't even get the word right to start off with, but it's, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee." And for me, that gave me a lot of clarity. And the next bit is, "because he trusteth in thee." I just had to trust God. I had to trust the Lord Jesus. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1066s) couldn't control this.

God was in charge and I had to go with it. And that actually really took the pressure off. And whilst that scan actually came back and it was good, it was quite a life-changing moment for me. And then, yeah, I mean, he passed six months after that.

I'm not going to go into all of that, but one quite strange thing is that there weren't any of the photo albums around then that the Brethren have of every single household. So my brother-in-law, who's very keen on photography, he got some photos printed up. These were sent out, thousands of photos were printed and sent out around the world to different people in Australia and New Zealand and the US, whatever, around the UK. And then of course, we'd get people coming up to us at meetings, "Oh, we've got your picture on our fridge." And even years after. And so we were known to the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1153s)

I mean, in fairness to the Brethren, was that done as a sort of symbol of support for you and your then wife that the Brethren are thinking of you?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1161s)

Very much so. And it was very, yeah. I said to a customer once, saying about it, and I said, you know, I know every day there's thousands of prayers going up for my little boy. And it was very encouraging for us at that time. But it had that sort of ongoing thing that you'd sort of go somewhere and it's, "Oh yeah, you're Harry's dad, aren't you?" And even overseas.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1192s)

Yeah, I remember we used to pray for Harry Edwards.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1198s)

I think we had one of the photos as well, yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1206s)

Yeah. So I just wanted to touch on drink as well. As most people know, there's a fair bit of alcohol around in the Brethren. It's one of those things that's been more than tolerated for a long time. When I was growing up in the late 60s, it was a very exciting time because there were so many changes and Mr. Jim was doing this and that and the other, coming out with all sorts of new directives. You know, sisters could have their hair down, they'd give out hymns at the [meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1244s).

And he made an awful lot of the young people, "it's young people this, the young people that." And there were exciting things like toilet rolls being thrown at meetings and paper darts and all sorts, yeah, bizarre, and musical drums being played. Then of course Aberdeen happened and that sort of changed. Certain ministering brothers tried to sort of carry it on, but they didn't have the charisma or the authority of Jim Taylor.

But, you know, so there was, I mean, my first drink I was offered was at three-day meetings. We had two at Easter, '73 and '75. Pretty sure it was '73 when I would have been 10, and my little sister gave me a glass of whiskey that they had poured for us each, very, very weak. She was two years younger than me, she might have been 8 and I might have been 10, but I'm pretty sure she was eight and I was ten. So there was just alcohol around everywhere.

My dad [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1328s) push it any more than anyone else did, but it was a done thing at that time because Mr. Symington drank like a fish too. And so as a kid, I'd had this understanding that drinking was a really good thing. Mr. Taylor drank a lot of whiskey and Mr. Symington drank a lot of whiskey, so if you drank a lot of whiskey, it's got [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1358s) be good.

I remember one time I was around with some friends and they raided their dad's drinks cupboard and got this bottle of, I guess it was whiskey, and they each had a swig. I had a swig and I thought, "Ugh," but I said, "Oh yeah, that's great," because I wanted to be cool. But then I don't really remember [drinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1388s) much. We might be given a shandy or something when we were out. And of course there was the mandatory port at the supper every Sunday morning, which is something that I have quite strong feelings about now. That you know, six-month-old babies are given alcohol. Apart from being illegal, it's really dangerous. It shouldn't be done.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1414s)

And they're even younger than that, aren't they, when they're given it? Sometimes they're given it at like a month, two months old.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1421s)

Crazy.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1423s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1423s)

Crazy. And then, you know, just when we used to go to our interchange meeting at Ealing, there was an off-license just up the road by a big grassy area and we'd all go up there and we'd get beer and we'd be standing around drinking cans of beer after the meeting. No one batted an eyelid. I was 14 the first time I bought my own beer at that place. The owner didn't bat an eyelid and no Brethren ever said anything that I [recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1453s). It was just accepted.

And then when I had friends to stay or I'd go and stay with friends, more when I was in my late teens, 16, 17, 18, I used to come over to Belfast fairly regularly, we always had drink in the bedroom as well. So that's my goodness a bit, but then you get up to bed and then really [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1484s) drinking.

And that just went on. And then when I got married, it just carried on. I couldn't afford to drink as much once I got married. And for 25 years, I drank pretty heavily every day. I didn't get drunk as such. It never got me directly into trouble as an immediate consequence of my drinking, but there was some pretty heavy drinking going on.

So by the time I was in my mid-40s, I'd had my own business. I'd been self-employed for nearly 20 years by then. We hit some circumstances where the business went downhill. We were in the gardening industry, and the garden industry basically crashed because the BBC started the Garden Force program, which was very popular. A lot of garden centers closed or sold on and lots of people in the industry had major problems, and we had major problems, and that caused problems at home.

We had some [pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1588s) serious marriage problems and it was New Year's Eve or early New Year's Day 2010, I decided to go and visit a certain guy's house and as an upshot of that, the following day I found myself in the Priory Rehab Hospital.

I was sat in the corner of a room with, I think seven, maybe five people around me, basically telling me I had to go into the Priory to save my marriage. They said, "We'll look after your family, we'll look after your business, you just go in there, get sorted out."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1646s)

Just to try and capture, I'm trying to imagine the kind of pressure you all would have been under as a family. You had how many children by this stage?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1658s)

We'd had six, so lost one, so we had five at home.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1663s)

Yeah, so five at home and you've got a business that has hit hard times through no fault of your own and a house to maintain.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1672s)

I made some bad business decisions, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1675s)

Okay, but you've shown that, I mean, it's a scenario that in a sense anybody could hit in their life, isn't it? But what I'm trying to capture is you were in a very tight-knit community. What support did you feel at that time?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1701s)

I mean again, I'm slightly embarrassed Ross because of what happened to you. Basically the Brethren, they came together, they raised a lot of money and they paid for me to go to rehab. No loan or anything, they just paid. And they actually raised the money and they did some, they redecorated our hall, didn't use carpets in the hall staircase and landing and other things. And that was across the board.

That was the interchange and even Brethren outside of the interchange gave money. It was, yeah, it was amazing. But there was, well I'll come to that maybe a bit when I came out.

But going in, I was terrified because I'd never eaten with anyone who wasn't Brethren. And on the way, I asked one of them, I said, "What do you do? What about eating?" And they said, "Oh, no, Mr. Hales says you just basically go with it. You do what they tell you to do, so if you're meant to eat together, you eat [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1783s)." And so I was really nervous.

So yeah, I went into this very protected space, basically a secure psychiatric hospital at the end of the day. Locks on the windows, locks on the doors. I had been through, I'd had suicide attempts and I was actually on hourly suicide watch when I was in there because I was in a very, very bad way. Just after I got in, I had a visit from a couple of Brethren guys who basically gave me some more information about stuff in the marriage which hit me really hard.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1839s)

So they basically kicked you when you were down.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1844s)

Yeah, well, I don't think they did it maliciously. They did it to let me know what's what and to say a certain guy had been withdrawn from. I think maybe they thought that might have cheered me up. It didn't. And yeah, I basically had a plan and I let this slip to somebody, one of the workers in there, and I was put on one hour watch.

In [fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1875s), at that point they said, "If you carry on like this, we're going to put you on 15-minute watch and you won't be able to go to any meetings, you won't be able to go swimming," because we had various treats you had in there. And you know, basically, "sort yourself out." And with support...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1892s)

Sorry, if you don't mind me asking Steve, which branch of the Priory were you in? Because I was in Bristol.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1901s)

I was at Roehampton.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1903s)

Okay, yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1904s)

The Priory, so it's quite glamorous, very, very wealthy people there.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1909s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1910s)

Quite famous people there, media, didn't know who were there and all sorts.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1916s)

Yeah, I had a well-known singer's son in there with me.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1921s)

Right, yeah. Going in, I did not want to go in. I didn't think I needed to be there, but I was told, "Well, the police would look at things sympathetically," because of what I got up to a couple of days before. And so it was like, "You need to get in there." I didn't do anything too bad, a bit of criminal damage.

But [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1957s) priests, they asked me about it. A very high up guy that I've read with, but he was sort of one of the top bods in the UK. He said to me, "I can understand why you did it, but it wasn't right." So there was sympathy and there was love generally, I wasn't treated badly.

But [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=1989s), I had to get in there and that's when I was introduced to this 12-step program. We went to different programs with different people. So I've been to different fellowships as they call it, slightly ironic. There's Alcoholics Anonymous, there's Overeaters Anonymous, there's Cocaine Anonymous, there's Drug Addicts Anonymous. You can name it, they say there's 57 varieties, a bit like Heinz. Whatever you've got, there's a 12-step program for it.

And I got into those meetings and I enjoyed them and I liked what I heard. I didn't buy into the program but I enjoyed the social side of it. And particularly when I came back out, I did find quite a lot of support there and it was a positive input in my life. And when I came out, I continued going to meetings. Not everyone agreed with it, but my understanding was that Bruce Hales had given his approval. Some Brethren were very positive about it and some were quite negative about it, and I got it both ways from different ones.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2082s)

I had exactly the same experience.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2084s)

Yeah. Because I'd been in the Priory, I mean, previous to that, Brethren had got involved in my business and were trying to help us. But basically, there was one guy that was helping me, he said to one of the others, "You know, there's some businesses you just can't grow." He's had it with one of his businesses, so he'd kindly given it to a brother-in-law.

But you know, it gets to a point, and our industry was in free fall. The [best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2115s) one in the world, we had a product that had been very fashionable and we could sell it for almost any price, and now we had huge stocks of a product we couldn't sell at any price. It was just, it was gone. It was horrendous.

So they arranged for me to get a job in another Brethren business where I would do like an eight-hour stint there, starting early in the morning, and then go to my business in the afternoon, at which time I was down to just one employee then, and sort of limping along. I was under huge pressure to actually get rid of it, basically just dump it, but I had a huge investment in it [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2166s) and I was a bit resistant to that. We continued selling product and just selling stock, and for me, it was the right thing to do because we were just getting some money in.

Anyway, I worked in another business, the guy that I have huge respect for, a very successful business doing office fit-outs, so furniture and all the kit, carpets, [air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2196s) conditioning, you name it, the whole lot. And I got on well there, I really enjoyed it.

During that time, sorry, jumping around a little bit, when my business was going well, I had lots of jobs in the Brethren. I did what we called the dinner list, so the allocation of Brethren every second or third week. When you're talking about 550 Brethren, you know, out for meals and whatever. We developed software for it, I was a guinea pig for that, that was brilliant.

I was a regional director at UniFocus, the sort of precursor of UBT, and lots of other stuff. I was involved with the school and that's one thing, I used to do PE with the boys. Obviously, boys had to be separate to the girls, and I used to take them to five-a-side football or whatever.

At one particular year, at the end of the year, I said to the trustees, and they were happy with it, that I wanted to give the boys a bit of a treat and we'd go to Go Ape. So I sent out a letter to the parents and most of the parents were fine, but some parents were like, "No way is our child going anywhere like that." It's a common entrance. I said, "What about when you go to Tesco's?" But you know.

Yeah, and then another time, we'd been over to the war graves in Belgium and we thought it'd be really good to take a load of kids over there. So we took, I don't know, a year of kids, two carloads of us. We went over to Belgium for a day, went around the war graves, and you can go, actually, there's some of the old trenches you can actually see what it was all like. Brilliant day out. And then to Bruges [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2325s) the afternoon. Kids absolutely loved it, but some folk, they were like, "No way, we're not doing that." So even within our own sort of city, different people had different standards as to right and wrong.

Anyway, back to when I was, this is about 2012, I've got this job, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2355s) around that time there was a lot going on with the Charity Commission, who had basically refused an application for a Brethren meeting room in Somerset, I think it was, or Devon, on the basis that the Brethren didn't demonstrate any public benefit from the charity.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2390s)

To clarify for that, I think that was actually off the back of a law change, wasn't it, in 2006? Because they'd always had charitable status, but the law changed to say that charities had to prove public benefit to demonstrate. That's where they came unstuck.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2407s)

I think it was after the 7/7 bombings, wasn't it? Because some of the guys that were trustees of a Muslim church... And so to be fair, I mean, I had a bit of a different opinion from the Brethren, but you don't really like to say it at the time.

I did say to one or two, "I don't know why we just don't go to the Charity Commission and say, 'Sorry, we've got it wrong. We've always done it this way, we never had to do this before. Tell us what we need to do and we'll go with it.'" I think they would have respected that, but instead the Brethren tried to prove they were being charitable.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2447s)

I think they absolutely would because we actually had a meeting with the Charity Commission some years back, after 2012, and they very much came with the ethos, "We encourage charities to change, we're not there to just strike them off the register willy-nilly." You know, without a thought. "We're there to try and encourage them to make the changes necessary so they are fulfilling charitable benefits." And so I can see where your [logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2477s) came from, Steve.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2478s)

Just make the change. Well, I mean, to me it seems, you know, the Brethren had been fulfilling the law because back in whatever, the 80s, there was that big case and we then had to put notice boards up outside every meeting. As far as I was concerned, the Brethren thought they were fulfilling the law in what they were doing. We could have easily just said, "Just show us what we need to do and do it." But instead, we had this massive campaign to prove that the Brethren had always been charitable, which is not how I've seen it. I mean, as a kid, not allowed to ever put a penny in a charity box.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2533s)

It was expressly said that you would give to the Brethren, not to the outside world. If you had spare money, it was given to the Brethren, wasn't it?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2541s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2542s)

It was called an unequal yoke, wasn't it? Where we were entering into what the rest of the world were doing.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2553s)

Yeah. And even like mufti day, a lot of kids wore non-uniform clothes to school because then they would have to give some money to some charity.

So, I don't want to dwell overly on all this, but there was a Baroness Berridge, she basically did a recording of a speech in the House of Lords and we watched it as a family because that was only approved, that was on the white list that you could watch on your laptops. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2600s), so we watched it and some of the stuff she said in there, I thought just didn't make sense, it wasn't right.

So I actually called her office and said, "Look, you know, it's a great speech, but honestly, some of it you've got wrong, it's not all correct." And so she said, "Well, do you want to come and tell me what it's really like?" So yeah, I did, and corrected quite a few [misconceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2631s). I didn't go there to badmouth the Brethren. I didn't slander anybody or make anyone out to be worse than they were or anything like that. It was like, "No, this is really what we do." And you know, they were laboring under some really odd stuff that they thought the Brethren did. They didn't know, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2661s) they didn't get bank mortgages, and it's like, "Yes, we do." That's just one thing I remember.

Anyway, that sort of snowballed a bit and I got involved with a number of members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, senior clergy, and government departments and the media. And it got quite big, it was quite scary.

There was a point when, I'll come to a little bit later, but I'll come to that then. I'm just going to read a little bit because I wrote a lot of stuff down, as I was going to publish a book, which is still there.

But after a period of time, in October 2013, we went to what's called the Achiever's Seminar in Warwick, and about two and a half thousand Brethren were there. We parked up and we went in, we got our drinks and bacon roll and what have you, and then queued up to go into the main auditorium. And even then there were two queues, there's a male queue and a female queue. The men's queue was shorter because we didn't have any handbags.

I went through an x-ray scanning machine, it didn't respond to me, so I had nothing on me. I had to wait while they were frisking some people in front. So I said to the guy that was overseeing it all, "Oh, you want me to, you know, you're going to frisk me?" And he said, "Oh no, you're all right." And so I went through. [My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2788s) wife came with me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2789s)

Just to clarify, this is a Brethren seminar but not a meeting, have I got that right? So it's basically Brethren frisking Brethren to check what? They haven't got recording devices? What was the purpose behind that?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2805s)

Yeah, devices or cameras or anything.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2809s)

Okay, an achievement seminar for kids.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2812s)

Yeah, for kids, it's the school kids.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2816s)

I see, it was for school kids. Okay, right, just trying to sort of clarify the scene.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2823s)

Anyway, we went in and we sat there and we waited around and there was talk that BDH was going to be turning up. We were there for about two hours and then someone came walking up and down the aisles looking along all the rows, the guy who previously said to me, "No, you're all right." Up and down and up and down, and he disappeared off. About 10 minutes later, someone walked up and said they wanted the three rows, that's the row in front of us, our row, and the row behind, to go out and go through the scanner again because they detected some electronic activity.

So as we were walking out, one of my local Brethren from the interchange said, "Oh, so I sussed you out then Steve, had they?" with a big fat grin on his face. And I thought, "Yeah, how did you get that sort of thing."

So I knew I was safe, I had nothing on me. We went back through the scanners and as I was going through, this guy said to me, "Could you step this way please?" I said, "Okay," and he said, "I'm afraid you can't return to the seminar. I'm asking you to leave the premises."

I said, "Why on earth is that?" He says, "Because you've been acting suspiciously."

I said, "That's ridiculous, what do you mean by that?" He said, "I can't say, but you've been refused entry to one of these seminars before, haven't you?" I said, "No, never, I haven't." I made a little argument about that, then I said, "I need to speak to someone from UBT." And he said, "No, there's not anybody here." I said, "Yes, there is, it's Colin with them." He said, "Oh, well then, no, they're all too busy."

So I said, "What about my wife?" He said, "We'll go and get her out." So I said, "We're probably best not to because of the cringe factor." They said, "Okay, fine, we'll leave her there." I was then escorted out of the area and they said they wanted me [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2968s) leave, go away.

I said, "Well, what if I refuse to leave?" And these guys you wouldn't really mess with just said, "We will encourage you to leave." So I thought there's no point, I'm not going to...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2987s)

Were these Brethren guys or proper security?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2991s)

These were security guys, these were official Brethren security.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=2995s)

Right, so these were security guys presumably employed by the Brethren. And where was the seminar actually held? Had a hall been hired or some sort of venue?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3006s)

No, it was the UBT headquarters at Warwick.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3010s)

Oh.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3010s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3011s)

A huge shed had been turned into an auditorium.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3015s)

Okay, also just for the listeners, how much did you have to pay to go to this seminar?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3021s)

I haven't got a clue, can't remember. It was refunded, so...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3031s)

So they have this seminar set up, but they obviously bring in scanners and independent security personnel. But from the way you're describing it, bear in mind the only people there are Brethren community people who should all be one big happy family, because that's what they like to promote, isn't it? Their sense of community. But it sounds like you went through something akin to airport security.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3061s)

Exactly the same, yeah. I mean, that was all done by the Brethren. These security guys were more on the outside, on the boundaries, just sort of keeping it, making sure we weren't being sort of mobbed by...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3077s)

Opposers.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3079s)

What?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3079s)

Was it because BDH was going to be there, or was that general in the seminar?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3085s)

No, I think that's always like that. There was a rumor he was going to be there, but he didn't turn up. So anyway, they then had to get the keys for the cars because the cars were parked in, locked in, so I couldn't just drive off. So they had to get the keys to the cars in front of me and move them out of the way.

Eventually, I got out and started to drive off and a little white van came out behind me with a great big long [aerial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3115s) on top and started following me. So we had a little bit of fun, I got rid of him. But I was in a mess, I was completely freaked out. It was horrible, horrible.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3135s)

Well, you didn't know what you'd done, you didn't know what this was all about presumably.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3139s)

No, I didn't. I had no... okay, so I had been in touch with persons that the Brethren might definitely not be particularly impressed about. I didn't realize that anyone knew anything about it. It was the first I knew of it. So they must have got on to something but didn't have any real evidence, couldn't catch me red-handed. Unfortunately, I wasn't red-handed. And then I heard a rumor afterwards that I was covered in wires, was a rumor that was going around the country.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3182s)

We know about the Chinese whispers amongst the closed community.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3187s)

They get more and more fantastical, don't they?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3189s)

They do. Yeah. Because BDH was in the country, we also had an invitation to the meeting. I'm going to speed this up a bit because there's other stuff I want to talk about. But he turned up there and I was eyeballed on the way in by new security guys who came over to greet me when I parked the car and said, "Can you come with us please?"

I said, "What's going on?" He said, "We're going to search you. As long as you're okay, you can carry on as normal." So they searched me. I just took my belt off, my shoes off, they took the pen out of my pocket, so I had to take that [apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3232s) to see if there was a microphone or camera in it or anything. There was nothing. I wasn't so stupid as to go there with anything with me. Yes, I had got my own laptop by then, I got my own phone by then, but I wasn't taking those to fellowship meetings or Brethren seminars.

And yeah, so then I went inside and I sat right at the back of the Brothers' rows on the end, waiting to feel my collar be felt. After about half an hour, there was a, "Steve?" I was like, "Here we go." And it's like, "We need this row to move out to make room for more sisters because there's a shortage of seats for sisters." So then we go out into the foyer, but they've got big screens up so you can see BDH once he was there.

I was standing by this screen and it's, "Oh, Steve, can you come and sit over here?" So I had to go and sit, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3299s) coincidentally, next to the nephew of the guy BDH was staying with. Whether there's anything in that...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3308s)

Just paint a picture and tell me if it's inaccurate for people that perhaps aren't familiar. If there's a meeting with BDH, the room is usually very, the meeting hall is usually very, very full, isn't it? They'll put screens up around the foyer and the outside so people can actually congregate in the foyer and so on, so that they can effectively get as many people as possible to listen. Have I painted that picture you're describing correctly?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3338s)

They've got big screens.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3338s)

And in recent times, the meeting halls were built so that the doors literally folded right back between the meeting room and the foyer so that it was one big room.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3352s)

Yeah, well I was right outside the foyer and even though I could see into the room, where I was sat I couldn't see the front row. I didn't get a glimpse of the great man, but I could see him on the screen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3367s)

Like a pop concert really. Not as much fun, I don't think. No, maybe not as much fun.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3380s)

So it was, I lost a lot of weight that week between those two instances. It was horrific, absolutely horrific. I was totally freaked out because nobody came up to me and said, "Steve, you know, we think you're doing something." It was all completely this elephant in the room.

My wife and older son, they came to me at night and they said, "What's it all [about?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3410s) There must be something." I said, "I don't know. I do not know why it's happened." Well, you know, it was very tricky because I had a pretty clear hunch why it happened, but I didn't *know* why it had happened, so I said I didn't know what happened.

This all went on and on. I was watching, yeah, I was on peebs.net, that was very interesting, giving me a bit of insight. And I did meet up with one or two ex-Brethren, one of whom was an old friend of mine. He said to me that the Brethren are a cult, and I was like, "No way, no way." And he said to me, "I didn't become a Christian until after I left the Brethren." I was like, "Rubbish," fully programmed PB that I was at that time. I didn't have a lot of contact with ex-Brethren at all, very little in fact.

But then, a while after October, in the new year, I'm just going to read something here.

“This whole period shook me up a lot as I never wanted to lose my family and I was really worried that the Brethren would find out what I'd been up to. So early in the new year, I utterly destroyed my laptop, smashing it up with a sledgehammer to ensure no evidence on it could be used against me.

I remember one evening around that time with another Brethren family at our house, having a thoroughly good time, thinking, "I don't ever want to lose this." This was exactly my dilemma with the Brethren. It's an extremely good social life with a very high standard of living, coupled with a huge level of control. I loved my job working in a successful Brethren business, dealing with all types of clientele from huge global conglomerates through to fairly small businesses.

I have five wonderful children whom we brought up to be fully committed to the Brethren ethos. I had siblings and many great friends within the Brethren. I was terrified of losing all this and of having to live out there in the big bad world. I'd spent a lifetime thinking that 'worldlies' were all godless, wicked people without any real sense of righteousness or moral awareness. It had been said so many times that if you go out into the world, then you go out into the [darkness.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3597s) John Hales had said that to leave the testimony where we were privileged to have the most light was the spirit of apostasy.

The Brethren looked down on other Christians and referred to them derogatorily as 'Christendom'. The Brethren are so brainwashed into a state of mindless conviction that they are right and everybody else is inferior in terms of character, discernment, lifestyle, ethics, and knowledge of God. It is commonly stated that, "We don't want to unchristianize anyone," but with the sense being that unless you're in the Brethren, then you're not a real [Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3636s). It creates a huge amount of fear of being excluded from this most privileged place.

Within this background of perceived God-given and blessed circumstances, I struggled with a lot of the behavior of the Brethren under the Bruce Hales regime. So many precious lifelong principles have been thrown overboard by BDH and the organization had been turned upside down. Whilst when I was growing up, brothers in places of responsibility [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3666s) there due to their spirituality and knowledge of the Bible and the Brethren teaching, this was forsaken in favor of those who were successful in business and had good managerial capabilities, who were skilled at strictly enforcing Bruce's edicts and business know-how.

Since the marriage breakdown, I'd been relegated to a backseat and removed from any position of responsibility. I still took part in meetings occasionally but was no longer invited to do so. I was only asked to preach on very rare occasions and to be fair, this was a relief as I found it such a strain. I'd feel obligated to inject some glowing spiel about the great leaders and our brother currently. The meetings at that time had become so [far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3715s) removed from Christian teaching that I struggled to engage.

Sometimes things were said that I thoroughly disagreed with, doctrinally or factually false or unsound, but I wouldn't object every time without appearing, I thought, as Mr. Angry. One time a brother quoted Jim Taylor saying, "When you're wrong, you're right." I challenged this and stated that Mr. Taylor had said, "When you say you're right, if you've been wrong," which is substantially different, and this correction was accepted. Another time a local brother quoted BDH saying that his father's sufferings were in the same league or principle or condition as Christ's. I didn't dare object to this publicly but spoke to a well-read older brother about it and he completely agreed it could not be correct, that John Hales' did not include atoning sufferings.

Then in June 2014, one evening my son said to me, "Have you still got that phone?" So he knew I had a phone, and I justified it because I was in a 12-step program. I said, "I'm not having UBT monitoring my phone. I have confidential phone calls and messages and stuff, I'm not having UBT monitor it." Of course, they denied that it was, and I said, "Sorry, it is, I know it is. I'm not going for it."

And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3813s) then my son said, "Have you still got a phone?" I said, "Yeah, I have." He said, "Why? You know it's wrong and you shouldn't have it. It's inconsistent with going to the table at the Supper." I explained that going to the table has nothing to do with what phone I have, it has to do with my link with Christ and that UBT is a complete rip-off. He says, "You know that Mr. Hales knows better than we do and he gets what he is direct from the Lord."

I said, "I'm sorry, it says in the Bible about not laying up for yourselves, which is completely the opposite of what the Brethren are doing with UBT."

Then it's, "Mr. Hales knows more than we do and we have to trust what he says." I said, "I am not prepared to go against what the Lord says. I do not accept I should put ministry ahead of the Lord's word."

The next day, at lunchtime, I'd been able to do a little talk at a 12-step meeting and I just picked a random reading from a bit of literature and the title of the page was "Freedom from Prison," which a few hours later I thought [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3906s) interesting.

That night we got home from the interchange meeting and my oldest son said that he was actually coming home for the night. He'd normally stay over there because he worked that direction. He said he was coming home, so my other two boys had gone out for kebabs. We shared those and I went to bed about a quarter past 10\.

As I was getting undressed, I got a knock at the door to say that a certain person was at the front door and wanted to talk to me. So I pulled on some clothes and went downstairs and he said, "Can you just come outside? I want to talk to you." So I went outside and it's like, "Can you just jump in the car? Probably better there." So I went to the car and there were two other guys sitting in there. I got [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3958s) the front passenger seat and this was read out to me: "We are here to tell you, you are being confined for speaking to persons out of fellowship. Your good friend Laurie Moffett has shopped on you. You have been speaking to persons out of fellowship and passing information to them."

So I said, "Yeah, I have spoken to Laurie Moffett, but not much." [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=3988s) says, "Laurie has given us lots of information. You've been speaking to lots of people. You need to get right, come clean. It will be confirmed in the meeting tomorrow night. You can't be there. You can stay in the house at the moment and your family can stay there as well, but you can't eat with them." So that was a bit of a shock.”

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4014s)

So again, to put this into context, for us three it's kind of familiar terminology, but to put this into context, what this actually means for you: the knock on the door was quarter past 10 at night, not the most social hour. You had to get in the car where there were three Brethren men sitting there to talk to you. You were never asked if you wanted any support with that meeting, you had to see them on your own. And then you had this statement read out to you that basically had the potential to rip your life away.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4046s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4048s)

Probably because you'd been having contact with somebody or some persons who had left the Brethren. I mean, not a lot of contact, but...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4059s)

Basically, you were ambushed.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4062s)

Yeah, eventually. Because actually, one of these guys, if you'd seen him at the meeting, you wouldn't have known anything was going on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4070s)

No. And then the other thing that I think makes me feel quite angry, you then get told the Brethren will discuss this at the meeting and you can't be there. Now, how is that right? How is it right that you're accused of a Brethren crime, but you're told to stay at home while they have it? That's like saying you're accused of a crime and we're taking you to court, but you've got to stay at home. There's nobody there [representing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4100s) you and the person accusing you's lawyers will discuss it with the judge. I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that, does it?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4108s)

It's a complete kangaroo court. No defense. I have no support. No one to...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4115s)

To advocate for you or to even offer you emotional support.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4121s)

Exactly. But that's just what they do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4127s)

You and many others, sadly.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4130s)

Many, many others. Yeah. So anyway, the next day I went to my work, not to the Brethren I was in, and nobody contacted me or anything until the evening. I'd actually gone to a 12-step meeting and it was a double, basically there's one at 6:30 and one at 8 o'clock, and I decided to do the double. When I came out of the 8 o'clock one, which was at 9 o'clock, guys there had said to me, I explained about what happened a little bit, and so some guys said, "Well, we're going out to a restaurant, you want to come with [us?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4183s) Come for a meal."

So I went to my car to get my wallet and I got to the car, the hazard lights were flashing. I thought that's a bit odd, but it was parked on the end in the church car park and I thought, "Oh, someone just bumped it or something." I got in and I pulled the door shut, it was like, that's a bit weird. I looked around and the rear passenger window was smashed.

I'm just going to read my recollections from the time. I looked for and found my wallet, which had £80 cash in it, on the front passenger seat and got out to survey the damage. I checked my briefcase was untouched and found that my laptop had gone from the front passenger footwell. My laptop was a few years old, it was in [desperate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4244s) need of replacement.

My wallet, which had been on the front passenger seat with £80 cash in it, was still sitting there, but this wrecked old laptop had disappeared from the passenger footwell the day after I was shut up. Now, obviously the Brethren wouldn't do anything like that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4277s)

Do I sense some sarcasm there?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4283s)

Would this have been your own laptop, so an independent one, or a UBT laptop?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4289s)

It was a UBT laptop, a rented one, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4293s)

So it probably wouldn't have been a huge amount of good to a smash-and-grab opportunist, would it really?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4301s)

It had lots of records on it, lots of Brethren stuff. Yes, thankfully anything that was vaguely incriminating was always on a memory stick, which wasn't stolen by a passerby.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4327s)

I presume you never got that laptop back?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4329s)

No, no. Reported it to the police, got a crime number, but no. It's funny, you think something like that would have been dumped and so would have been reported, but no, it wasn't found. Maybe someone thought it was valuable out there, I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4351s)

I'm sure that people thought it had valuable information, Steve. Let's leave it there.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4356s)

Yeah. We went out to a restaurant and whilst there I got a phone call from one of my priests. I sort of dived out of the restaurant because I didn't want anyone to think I could possibly be anywhere so wicked. Outside, I told him about it and he was like, "You poor guy," you know.

The guys I was with, they were very kind, you know, they didn't [let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4386s) me pay for my meal and were extremely supportive. I just said on here, "Yeah, this was my first social meal in a restaurant and I felt very out of place as the environment and situation was so alien."

The guys found the whole thing completely bizarre, which became a common experience for me as people struggled to comprehend how this kind of society could exist in 21st century Britain. So many times people were just aghast when they heard my story.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4424s)

Every time. Every time.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4426s)

Yeah. So then I had to tackle the Brethren job thing. And I was basically summarily sacked from there. I did show the letter, which of course I've still got, to a barrister that was at one of the meetings I went to, as in a central London high-flying barrister, and he said, "That is nothing but religious discrimination."

So anyway, we can leave that for another day, but it might come in handy sometime. Two pages of A4 of all the reasons why I was sacked, and none of it was anything to do with my job. It was all stuff and most of it was hot air.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4478s)

It wasn't even proven, proven crimes. I put the "crimes" in inverted commas.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4484s)

They jumped to conclusions that some stuff that was on the web had come from me, and it hadn't. Absolutely not.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4499s)

So at this point you were confined. What implications did that have for your family at that time?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4507s)

I'm just going to come to that. So about four weeks later, I got home from work and my wife said to me, "There's one thing I'd like to say to you. The children are finding it very difficult with you living in the house." My oldest daughter had finished at school and she said it's like her life has come to a standstill. She can't have anyone to stay or do anything with her friends. "We're meant to go to someone's house before the meeting, we don't manage to, there's never time."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4542s)

So again, if I can just pick up on that, is this a ritual that actually happened if someone within the household is confined? The members that aren't, on the way to the meeting, have to kind of go to another Brethren house on the way?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4561s)

My children had to do the same. When my children were living with me, they had to do that. Spend 10 minutes in my parents' house before they went to the meeting.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4572s)

Yeah, my parents had to do the same so they didn't come from an unclean household.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4578s)

So, and then funny enough, the next day my daughter asked me if I could cut her hair, trim her hair, you know. So she wasn't that freaked out by having me in the house. This is a girl, she'd go to the hairdressers to have her eyebrows trimmed.

And then one night after that, a few days after that, one of my sons came to my bedroom door and asked if he could talk to me. He said he was really stressed with the situation and not knowing how it was going to turn out, and it was affecting his performance at work and he was making costly mistakes, etc. He was very tender and loving and it clearly cost him a lot to talk in this manner.

As I was explaining how it affected me, my oldest son entered the room, and I said, "Hang on, look, we're just having a [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4637s)." And he said to his brother, "Don't listen to it, it's a load of crap, I've heard it all before, come on, come out." The younger one stayed in the bedroom and so they both ended up staying in the bedroom and we carried on talking.

The younger one said that he believed in BDH and held him as a prophet, citing an example he'd heard the previous weekend about a French brother with a vineyard that BDH had told him to sell. He also spoke about some Brethren's business experience, how they'd been advised to, they'd had some business advice, and basically the sales shot up. And then they were told, "No, actually, you keep the business because the testimony needs money." And a regular quote at the time was, "BDH is the testimony," so the testimony needs money.

Then the younger of the two expressed himself that if I was going to reject BDH, then he had no place with me and wanted me to leave the house. The older brother said that in view of the pressure on the kids, I should leave. He said that his younger sister didn't want to come home when I was in the house. He said that from her point of view, she'd always relied on me as her dad, even when there were problems, and then suddenly at the age of 15, she learned I was rejecting BDH, etc, etc, and it was a massive shock to her. And of course, the fallout for the kids was horrendous.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4746s)

But again, trying to picture, at this point in time, where were the Brethren with you? Were they giving you opportunities to put things right, in whatever that might mean? Were you clear about what you'd done wrong?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4766s)

I told them pretty much what I told you about what I've done.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4770s)

Yeah.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4771s)

And I apologized to them. I said, "And if in doing so I've caused any problem or harmed the Brethren, then I sincerely apologize and I ask your forgiveness." I was going to come to this, and they said, "Well, we can't forgive you because we don't know all the detail."

Funny enough, in some personal circumstances two or three years earlier, I had been told some stuff that had happened within my household, and that I had to, the priests knew all about it, and I had to trust the priests. I didn't need to know the detail from my own family. And now it was the other way around, they couldn't forgive me unless they knew all the detail.

And later on, a few years later, I mean, I brought this up with them occasionally. I said, "You know, when are you going to forgive me?" And then one time they said, "Yeah, we do, we forgive you in principle." And I mentioned this to a guy at church and he said, so [quoting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4849s) the Lord's Prayer, "So Father, forgive us our sins in principle, as we forgive those of others also in principle."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4865s)

It's just parroted language that we were taught to say that actually, I don't think anybody's even stopped to think what it means or whether it even means anything.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4878s)

No, not at all. But during that period of time, before I was shut up, not one single person ever approached me and asked me if I've got a problem or what was the problem or how could they help me. "Is there anything we can do?" And a long-standing priest, who is actually slightly younger than me but one of my friends, he would actively avoid me in the car park. I challenged him about it and he said, "No way," [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4908s) my recollection is that he most definitely did because I tried walking up to him and he'd suddenly change direction.

Shortly after I'd been shut up, I was asked if I would go and visit a psychiatrist in Harley Street, a top psychiatrist, because clearly I wasn't well. So I would see this psychiatrist with my sister. We had time on our own and then he said he'd see her at the end. He said to me, after we had a long talk through everything, he said, "I forgive you. I could prescribe you with some medication, but you'd be better to wash your hair in it."

And then he called my sister in and he said, "Steve is showing signs of depression and anxiety, and I would be very worried if he wasn't, given the circumstances, but he does not need any medication." Oh, that was, yeah, I was quite relieved about that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=4998s)

Well, good for the psychiatrist for saying this.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5001s)

Yeah, this is like a Brethren-approved psychiatrist, obviously. So I'm going to have to move out of the house. Basically, you know, I was being put under pressure to move out, and I understand it for the kids' sake, you know. And the Brethren, you know, they said, "We will do everything we can [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5031s) get you back on the straight and narrow and stuff like this," but we were on different tracks.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5038s)

I'll say, what else could you actually do apart from saying, "I'm sorry, and if I've hurt the Brethren, I'm sorry"? What else could you do, Steve?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5048s)

Well, you know, if I wanted to go back in, I would have to tell them every detail. That's just how they operate. And I wasn't going to. But as I'm saying, they didn't need to know. I mean, in Luke 15, the reprobate son, he didn't tell his dad everything. And it's like, "Whoa, welcome in," you know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5077s)

And also, you would have probably been forced to say that you agreed with everything BDH said when you obviously had queries.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5088s)

I couldn't go back. I was so uncomfortable in meetings. It was just so far, I mean, doctrinally, stuff was being said that was just so out of order. It was just Brethren-speak, it wasn't factually correct or doctrinally correct in my opinion. And there's so much that I disagreed with that was [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5118s) fundamentally wrong. I could not have lived in there.

And someone said to me when I was bemoaning the fact, you know, about how awful my circumstances were, this guy that I'm very close to, he helped me a lot in my recovery, he said to me, "Steve," he said, "when you were in there, you found it really, really difficult. He said, "God plucked you out of it. And now you're complaining."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5149s)

Yeah, that's a really good way to look at it.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5152s)

I wasn't complaining about not being in the Brethren, but I was, you know... It's nine years, just four days ago, since I had that knock at the door. And I've had minimal contact since then. I've had expressions of love from my kids, you know, we have had messages. I have met my boys on a very few occasions. I have [massive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5183s) hugs off them.

And in fact, talking of hugs, Brethren, you know, aren't allowed, aren't meant to shake hands with someone who's under discipline. Well, the night that I was withdrawn from by two of my old mates, they'd done this, told me, and I just laughed and they said, "Yeah, we thought you wouldn't be too fussed." Anyway, they gave them, and I said, "Well," I went through all the stuff and then they were going, I said, "Come on and give me a hug," just to see. And then they both gave me a nice big hug.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5220s)

It's just farcical, isn't it? I'm sure the times you've seen your children, you feel that there's still that connection there. You are their parent. And they will behave, and then there's that sort of, "Oh, but then..." And I actually think, I might be wrong, but I think that is probably the majority of the reason why the children don't contact their parents. Like your children, Ann, and your children, Steve, is because they know when they do, as you've said to me in the past, it's still mum, it's still dad. And they actually can't [cope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5260s) with that dissonance. He's the mum I love, or the son I love in your case, Ross. But they can't, you know, they can't cope with reconciling it with how they think they're supposed to behave. And it's tough for them, isn't it?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5276s)

It is. But I mean, you know, those priests, I think they should have known better. I mean, they just did what they felt was the right thing to do. And unfortunately, you know, in Brethren sort of rules, they were wrong, but it was fun.

So just fast forwarding a bit, I then went to a variety of churches because my faith had suffered, I'd struggled [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5307s) through all of this because, you know, if this is really what Christianity is all about, then you know...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5316s)

Yeah, I don't want any part of it if this is what it is.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5320s)

If this is what God is, I don't want it. But I didn't lose faith in God, I didn't. And basically, I believe, you know, you can't blame God because men are wrong. People do things in the name of God that are 100% wrong, totally wrong. And we see it in many, many ways, and the Brethren do it as well. They don't go around murdering people physically, but they murder them morally and emotionally.

So I went to churches. I went to some Church of England to start off with, which was, I didn't find a congregation of six with an average age of 80\. I moved to Oxford, near Oxford, a little village, and one Sunday I looked up, well, someone said to me, "What you need is an independent evangelical Baptist church." She said, "That's where you'll find home, sort of thing."

So I Googled this and I found one and I went there and I was really welcomed, it was nice. And the funny thing [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5404s), at the beginning of the service, they did a little talk for the children. I don't know if you read Pilgrim's Progress in early years, but yeah, a guy called Christian, you know, basically he had this conversion and then he left home. And the pastor was talking about this Christian guy who'd left home and his wife and his children were saying, "Come back, come back, you must stay with us." And it was, you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5434s), my hair was all on edge.

Anyway, the following Sunday I was going to go there again and I checked my watch and the satnav and I wasn't going to get there in time. So I quickly, there was another church in Oxford that I'd looked at the website on and I thought looked pretty good. So I checked the time to get there and I could get there on time. So I burrowed off there in a bit of a hurry, so I was [running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5464s) late.

It was a 10:30 service and I got there and it was just gone half past. I parked across the street and ran across and I saw people inside. I went to open the door and it was locked. Someone came to the door and I said, "Have you started already? I thought you started at half past." He said, "Yeah, half past 10, it's only half past nine."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5494s)

I thought you'd found another church that locked their doors, Steve.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5498s)

These guys, you know, for me, that wasn't a coincidence that I went there because they actually had quite a few people in the village where I was, or the adjacent village, very close. And I ended up in a home group there, a really strong home group that met on Wednesdays.

Anyway, that first Sunday I got there, after church someone came over to me because I was sitting on my own, a wreck, and came and talked to me and then asked me back for dinner, for lunch at their house. They had another couple, and the other couple of guests, they basically lived near where I was. And this sort of became my surrogate parents. They weren't much older than me, but they put their arms around me and they cared for me and they had me for meals and they did loads, absolutely amazing. The welcome I had was just unbelievable.

One of the most shocking things though was turning up on Sunday morning, they all [looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5559s) like they'd just come back from a picnic, they were so scruffy. You know, having been to Brethren churches which are more like business meetings and everyone's, you know, no jeans, no chinos, no brown shoes, no, you know, everyone's in one dress code. I really struggled with that. It's like, "Are you taking this seriously guys? You know, don't you realize where you are?"

I'm going to accelerate this a little bit. There's a lot I wanted to talk about here, but I found, you know, the welcome I had there was just absolutely amazing. The support, the love, the care, the kindness, without anybody asking for anything back.

I also found that guys that were 20, 30 years younger than me were better read in their scriptures and had a better understanding doctrinally of the scriptures. And I was fairly, I was very proud of my knowledge of scriptures in the Brethren. You know, I was one of those clever clogs who when anyone said, "Oh, where's the scripture about...?" I wanted to be the one that picks up the mic and says, "Yeah, it's Isaiah 26 verse 14," whatever.

Firstly, go out there, chalk and cheese. I was like nothing, it was incredible. And you see this couple that sort of adopted me, they were both professors at Oxford University. They lived in a house that my sons or other Brethren kids wouldn't even look at as their starter home. These guys, they would be giving tens of thousands a year to missionaries and to the church. They lived a very, very simple life. They drive a battered old car.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5671s)

But they're very rich because they have enough.

Exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5677s)

Isn't it?

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5678s)

Real Christians. And it was a shock, it was a real shock. It's like my equation, you know, you're earning all this money, why don't you get a better car? Why don't you have better food? You know, where's the nice big roast joint? Why is it a £1.99 Asda pizza or whatever? Absolutely amazing.

And then we'd have these Wednesday night home group sessions and they'd sit around and they'll [pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5709s). And you know, Brethren prayers are long if you're two minutes. Some of these guys pray for 10 minutes and yet it's amazing. I'll listen with rapt attention. I didn't know how to pray. When I left the Brethren, my prayers were shopping lists. It's, "God, I need this and this and this and this and this and yes, make this person well, give me some orders today, help me do this," and da-da-da-da-da.

And I've been taught [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5740s) differently, that I need to pray to ask for the grace to get through the day. I need to be able to have that faith in God, that God knows better than I do. He knows the end from the beginning. You know, the Brethren talk about their prayer meeting as a power meeting. That's blasphemous. Do they really think they know better than God and they have to instruct God on what to do? It's bonkers, it's crazy, it's really crazy.

So I got quite involved in that church there, it was lovely. I got asked to lots of people who had me to their houses and loads of support. They also put me under a bit of pressure, they asked me if I want to become a member of the church and I was like, "Well, I don't know." And then they said, "Well, you'll need to be baptized, it's a Baptist church." I said, "Well, no, I've been baptized already." And they said, "Well, as Baptists, we [believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5803s) you should believe and be baptized, it's not child baptism." So I said, "Well, I think my parents baptized me in faith, so I'm not going to be baptized again."

They were quite decent about it and they said, "Okay, if that's what you really feel, we'll go along with it. It's not what we normally do, but in your circumstances, we'll go with it." And then someone said to me, he had a chat with me about it, and he said, "You know, Steve, sometimes people, they've been married for a long time and they will go through their marriage rites again. It's not that they're getting married again, it's just like, and you could look at your baptism like that and have a church baptism. It's just like a refresher."

It [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5849s) like he was putting me under pressure, but it was just like, "Have you thought about it this way?" But I thought, "Actually, I like it." So I was baptized again in a Baptist church, which again was an amazing experience, like another sort of fresh start.

I also got involved with the Street Pastors. Street Pastors aren't people that go around preaching. What they do, it's an inter-denominational group of people and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5879s) all around the country where different churches, they will send one or two of their congregation and they'd all come together Friday night, Saturday night, whatever, down in the town center, city center. This is Oxford City Centre, which is pretty lively at the weekends with 35,000 students there.

And they just go out there. We have rucksacks, we go out, we've got bottles of water, we've got flip-flops for the girls who can't walk in their high heels, try and get some sugar into them because often they'll be drinking and not eating anything. And oh, bits and pieces, just support. And sometimes people would ask us to pray with them. We work [closely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5932s) with the police, we'd have a police radio so we could hear where the hot spots were and we could go along.

The police, they said the crime always drops when the Street Pastors are around. We all wore uniforms and that, and we could go in, you know, two o'clock, three o'clock and you've got four nightclubs all closing at the same time and it's mayhem. And we could be walking through the middle and never a problem. These young folk were so respectful, so decent, and laughing and joking [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=5962s) giving us hugs and kisses, and they're all half cut. We saw the very occasional ruckus, hardly anything. Just lots of people completely ratted, you know, thrown up. And yeah, so you end up with vomit on my shoes and trousers and stuff like that, you know, it goes with the territory.

And it's amazing. I saw these people and most of them, 80% of them were not drunk. They're just doing their hair, going out, having a good time, behaving well, and going home. That's what we were taught in the Brethren, absolutely fine.

And then also, you know, I've met up with extended family who were withdrawn from decades ago and I've re-established links with them. And I had ex-Brethren invite me abroad and I stayed with ex-Brethren abroad and had great times.

When I was in the Brethren, the thinking in there is if you go out, you go out into darkness, you won't make it. It's terrible, it's wicked, it's evil, everyone's bad. If you go out, you're giving up your Christianity. It's such a load of rubbish. You know, most people are lovely, most people are very decent. Of course, there's some weirdos, there's some horrible, nasty, violent, grotty people out here, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6062s) there is in the Brethren. But most people are fantastic.

And the reception I've had at churches has been amazing. The teaching I've had at churches knocks the spots off anything I've ever heard in the Brethren. There's, I'd also say for anyone who's in the Brethren or coming out, there's some fantastic stuff on the internet. A couple of really good preachers, one is John MacArthur, an American [pastor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6092s) who's in his 80s. He's got thousands of sermons and he's very, you'd think you're listening to the Brethren. His theology is very close to the Brethren, but he knows what he's talking about and he doesn't practice the extreme stuff that the Brethren do. He would eat, he would have a meal with someone and he would help people, he would go out of his way to help people. And another one, Michael Youssef, [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6122s) I think he's from Egypt and he converted to Christianity, absolutely brilliant. The teaching that's available is amazing.

And I have a great life out here now. I carry enormous sadness around with me. I'm desperate to see my kids. I've got children-in-law that I don't know of and haven't met. I've got grandchildren that I don't know of and haven't met. It's heartbreaking. I have [occasionally,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6153s) you know, might be in a cinema or watching a movie at home, if there's something that involves reunion, someone comes home or someone meets up after a long time, I have a physiological reaction. I don't see it coming. I will suddenly do a big, like it's like a panic attack, and I'll be in floods of tears and I can't do anything about it. It's bizarre and I'm not necessarily feeling sad, it's just a deep, I don't know where it comes from, deep physiological emotional [reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6193s) that just explodes from inside me when that nerve gets touched. Bang\!

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6201s)

It's right in the gut.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6205s)

It is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6206s)

For me it is anyway. It's this, you know, I can feel it a bit even hearing you talk. It's just this, yeah, it is. It's just this gut, deep, deep sadness. But life is so good out here too. It's not, you know, we should never feel guilty because we've been set free. Whatever the reason is, we've been set free. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6236s) you know, it's those that are left behind that I'm learning it's harder for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6243s)

I remember, you'll remember the sort of review period in 2002, 2003, and my husband saw his mother for the first time in 27 years. Now, he was obviously cut up, but I will never, ever forget the look on his mother's face. He was close to his mother, but she was coming from being in the Brethren and she hadn't seen her son for 27 years. And the [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6273s) on her face, I, it was, I'll never forget it. It's impossible to describe, but it probably was the visual of that gut feeling that you feel. And that's when you realize the system that those poor people are in.

It breaks people, as you say, it breaks people. But I think what you've said, Steve, is so important because we hope people in the Brethren listen to our discussions. That's why we do them. We do them to help people who don't understand the Brethren, but we do them to hope people in the Brethren listen. And it's not to be bitter and opposed and all the things we're accused of being, we've said that so many times. But it is to say that actually, look at you, you've come out, [you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6317s) had to lose everything, but you've actually found a faith that's kept you really strong. We also know that's not for everybody that leaves, but you do not need to fear that you will lose your faith just because you leave the Brethren. And I think that's the big thing to get through. In fact, you'll probably find it's better if you leave the Brethren, which seems to be the experience.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6344s)

Yeah, just to go back a bit, you talk about the gut feeling. I just want to share for me personally, if I'm watching a TV program or watching a film in the cinema, if anything comes up about death or burial, my mum's nearly 90\. I know she's going to go soon. I'm in floods and you can't explain it, it's just a gut reaction that you have.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6370s)

Yeah, yeah, it is. And who of us knows what will happen in the future? I think we all live in hope, don't we, that something will have to force the change.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6385s)

Well, other people are watching and listening and we don't know, it could be our children.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6392s)

We don't know.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6394s)

You know, and in the quiet of the night, I often think, you know, what is going through their minds? What went through my mind? You know, you were whatever age you were, I was 44, it took all those years to actually have the courage to step outside. To be honest with ourselves for the first time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6420s)

Well, Steve, thank you so much for telling us your story. I know there's an awful lot you left out, so you'd be welcome back on any time to fill in those gaps that you want to. But we really appreciate it, and I just hope it gets the message out. And I think as we've said to all of those that have got children in the Brethren, you almost hope your children do watch it and realize what happened to you, but what's happened now, which is perhaps more important. [Yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6450s) thank you, Steve.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6454s)

Thank you, Steve.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6454s)

Yeah, thank you, Steve.

### [**Steve Edwards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0MhKZwa-Uc&t=6456s)

Okay, thanks.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
