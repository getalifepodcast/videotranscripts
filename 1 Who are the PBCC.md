### [**Generic**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D5s)

Hello everyone. Welcome to the Get-A-Life Podcast. We're here to have Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm Lane. With me today are Cheryl, Carman, and Richard. Cheryl, could you tell the listeners the purpose of this podcast?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D20s)

Hi everyone. We are here to have Ex-Cult Conversations and start to create a safe place to bring on ex-members to tell their story.

We're going to have some crazy laughs about things that we did and just kind of open up the door to have conversations that need to be had. I think this is a long time coming podcast.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D45s)

And Richard, could you tell us what is this cult that we want to talk about today?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D53s)

Well, I think most of the listeners will know something about what it is, but some may not. What we're really concentrating on is the so-called Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, who used to be non-denominational and just got called exclusive brethren or Plymouth Brethren.

But they've been increasingly radicalized. They started over 200 years ago, but from the 1960s onwards, they became radicalized and extremist. In more recent years, since around 2000, when Bruce Hales took over, they've become increasingly obsessed with money. It has now morphed into a massive commercial operation where the members of the cult, [all](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D105s) 54,000 of them, are essentially a marketplace to which a small clique at the top can market goods and services and receive extremely huge amounts of money in return.

In addition, they use businesses belonging to cult members to lobby governments to get government contracts, and it's basically turned into a huge money-making machine with a captive consumer base.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D144s)

Wow, so what you're saying is it used to be a church, it kind of started as a church, and since the early 2000s, it's turned into a business, basically?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D156s)

Well, a kind of a global mafia, yeah. It's incredibly exploitative of its members, and not only that, because they have so much to hide and because they need these members to make money from, they take extreme measures to prevent people from leaving. People who do leave are harassed and persecuted and surveilled.

In particular, anyone who speaks out, [they](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D186s) will, there's almost nothing they will stop at in terms of trying to prevent someone from speaking up and pointing out to the world at large that this is not the nice, warm, and fuzzy Christian organization they claim to be. This is a very nasty and in some places criminal mafia that's exploiting its own members and also exploiting governments, other businesses, and health services globally.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D218s)

Wow, that's huge. And Cheryl, you know about the criminal stuff that goes on there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D224s)

Yeah, and I was just going to branch off of what Richard is saying. Not just with maybe, you know, teenagers that are rebelling, but coming to the reason, one of the reasons Carman is where she's at is, I mean, Carman can explain her story, but it was the reaching out of so many teenagers that had left and she was trying to help the situation. Carman, you can expand on that on your story that got you to where you are.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D252s)

Well, when we first started to reach out and try to change the situation, what we had seen was a huge number of young people that were just literally put out on the street. We reached out to the elders and the leadership of this church and said, "Hey, this is not biblical. This is not what you say you are." You know, if you say you're a church, you say you follow the Bible, why is it straying so [far](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D283s) from that? In that process, they made our lives so difficult that we had no choice but to leave.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D290s)

Wow. And let's expand on what some of these crimes were. Like, it was the worst of the worst, wasn't it?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D300s)

Oh, worst of the worst. Like, advising brethren to kick out, like literally kick out a 13-year-old, put them out on the street with their clothes and their possessions and say, "You're out." You know, if you don't agree with all of the stuff that's going on in the church, go and find your own way. At 13, 14, 15 years old, we saw 18 young people put out and every one of those, their families were attacked, their families were [destroyed.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D330s)

I mean, as soon as you lose one of your family members, there's a hole in your family. What we addressed with some of the leaders in Maple Creek, which is where we were from, was this is the future of your church and you're putting it out on the street corner.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D348s)

You don't need a moral workshop to know that's wrong.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D352s)

No, no.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D356s)

And the irony is that the brethren on their very, very fancy PR website, one of their biggest slogans is "family is at the heart of all we believe and all that we do." Nothing could be further from the truth, because what they've done consistently almost for their entire history is to destroy families. It's deeply embedded in their psyche that the assembly, as [they](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D386s) call themselves blasphemously incidentally, is more important than the natural family.

They use the terminology "the first family" and "the second family," whereby the first family they mean your natural family and by the second family they mean the brethren organization. It's consistently ministered that you must put the second family first. You transfer from the first family to the second family. Indeed, if [you](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D416s) go through any brethren congregation, you know, their phone book, their list of members, you'll find that nearly every individual in that congregation has lost a brother, a sister, parents, grandparents, children, cousins.

It would be probably 80 or 90 percent of the members have a close relative that they've had to cut off and treat as if they're dead because that's what the church's rules have imposed on them.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D451s)

Yeah. Excommunication. And what did they call that? Let's let our listeners know what they called that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D457s)

They call it withdrawing from.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D461s)

Yeah, withdrawal from. And why do we all know so much about this church? It's because every single one of us was a member and grew up in it. Every single one of us has been a victim of their abuse and their absolute terribleness, and that's what we're here to talk about today.

Let's talk about maybe some news because maybe we'll have some Brethren listeners in the future. I have a couple things I just wanted to talk about that's in the news. It's really current right now in the Brethren, in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. That is the Moral Workshop. Bruce Hales is going on about this. Why that's so silly is because I've never needed a workshop to help someone on the street that falls down, right? If I see someone fall down and hurt themselves, I've never needed a workshop to know that that person needs help.

But you [do](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D517s) need a moral workshop when you excommunicate people, because it's unnatural. So you have to go and you have to convince yourself that it's okay to cut off family members, when it's really not. Really, it's very immoral. But the moral workshop is a total joke. So that's just written right off.

What else is new? Roy Symington passed away in the church. He was a big VIP, very good friends with my father. And yeah, he passed away. What else? Oh, we found out that for marriages now, the young man is to choose three different young ladies and speak to them simultaneously, and then choose one and ask to marry. And the woman, of course, gets the perfect choice of yes or no. Wow. Isn't that wonderful? This is definitely not a cult. This is just a mainstream church. [Absolutely.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D578s)

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D578s)

Yeah. I mean, everyone does that, don't they?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D581s)

I mean, what other mainstream church could you go to that's going to partner you up? The church of matchmaker.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D591s)

The misogyny in this church, it's so bad. Richard, why don't you describe briefly a night in church and how the women sit in the back and everything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D602s)

Yeah, exactly. The women have to be silent in church. That's based on some scripture, which according to the brethren's translation says, "they will not suffer a woman to speak or exercise authority" or something. Whatever connection that may have been said in originally, this is very conveniently used to reduce women to the rank of somewhere between [slaves](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D634s) and pets, depending whether they're attractive or not.

In church, the women sit at the back, they have to sit behind the men. The only role they have is to give out a hymn, and all they can do is say the number. They can't say anything intelligible or intelligent. They aren't even allowed to use the microphones to do that, so a man has to repeat it for them. Otherwise, their voice might be too loud.

The misogyny extends into every other area of life as well. You go to a brethren's house for a meal. The meal is finished, the men all bugger off into the sitting room and sit around and talk business. It's the women who've slaved away to prepare the meal, who have to clear the table, do the washing up, look after the [kids,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D683s) change the diapers, while the fat cats lounge around on the sofa.

In business likewise, women can't have a position over a man. They're completely limited to the very bottom roles in any business. Then, of course, they're expected either to marry a brethren man to continue the progeny, the genealogy, or basically they [just](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D713s) have to live in their parents' house as an old maid.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D719s)

Carman, Cheryl, what did that feel like, being a woman in there?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D724s)

Well, the kicker of the whole thing is you can be the subject of their gathering and you cannot speak up. They can attack you for a whole 55-minute meeting and you can't say a word. It is torture.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D744s)

Well, I think we're starting to make up for that from this time, aren't we?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D752s)

Yes, we are. And you know, it even goes right down to, I mean, most people I'm assuming are going to know my story. But it even goes right down to the abuse that happened in there with myself. My perpetrator, Alan Drever, he owned me. I learned that from a very, very, very early age that if we went there on a break on Sunday, I knew that he would have, I knew that I would be pulled aside by him.

His brother-in-law, Morris Hope, knew what was going on. But the men just have this way in there of making sure that they have everybody's back no matter what's going on and everything is covered up. Absolutely everything is covered up. If they can't cover something up, then you are forced out.

I know for myself with the amount of Priestly visits I had, Priestly visits on my paper route, the amount of people watching me like a hawk as I [got](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D811s) older, I knew I was being pushed out. I knew that Morris did not like that I was becoming of the age where I could be vocal. I was a very strong-willed woman. It was do anything to be able to smash Barb and Danny's hope and let's see what we can do.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D832s)

It's the victim.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D832s)

Yeah, let's get the victim out.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D835s)

Yeah, and to make it clear, it's not just in church services that the men control everything. The whole church administration is run by overweight, middle-aged white guys right around the globe. Always has been, always will be. It's a completely masculine organization, masculine control. [Bruce](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D865s) Hales even says himself, he even said to his wife, and it's in print, that all she had to do was look pretty. That is disgusting, absolutely disgusting. It will be their downfall because the human spirit doesn't respond kindly to that kind of treatment.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D888s)

No. I was thinking about this the other day, and I just remember sitting down for every meal and we had to give thanks to God for the food. I remember being like, "Mom cooked this." Right? Like, I was like, "Mom worked on this for three hours, I watched her." You know? I don't know, that was just a weird thought I had. I remember just being like, "Okay, we're thanking God, but he didn't really bring anything. I went shopping with Mom, I saw her cook it, she did everything." Anyway, that's just my two cents.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D929s)

I mean, I used to help clear the table when we went out to other brethren for meals. I would help clear the table and I got these kind of funny looks, but I just felt bad about letting these poor sisters do all the work. The other little incentive is that the conversation in the kitchen was far more exciting and spicy than the conversation in the lounge room. Absolutely. You know, I got my kicks there.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D958s)

But for the listeners, let's be clear, the woman in the household is expected to make three meals a day, and not just tiny meals.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D968s)

No.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D969s)

No, every single day and all day on Sunday, massive, enormous meals. It's absolutely insane what they do.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D978s)

As well as all the washing and all the ironing and all the household tasks and looking after the babies and looking after any old people that need looking after and school trips and everything else.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D993s)

And don't complain and don't say anything about it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D998s)

No, because if you complain or if you talk about it, you're being insubmissive.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1004s)

Oh yeah, submissive is a big word, isn't it, in the brethren?

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1013s)

So I found out something that's really interesting, I did not know this. I guess because I've been out for 14 years. Bruce Hales only goes to church maximum like once a week. Yes, this is a fact. I've double-checked this through multiple sources, even in Australia. This is a fact. He goes to church at maximum now once a blankety-blank week. Can you [believe](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1043s) it? I remember as a kid, I went 365 days a year.

### [**Generic**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1048s)

Every damn day.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1049s)

At least, yeah. And all day Sunday, multiple times. It was ridiculous. And this blankety-blanker is enjoying cocktails at home?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1061s)

Oh, so is he doing the zoom ones or he's just doing one a week?

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1066s)

No, he, one, well he does the Zoom ones once in a while. And everyone he does is recorded and put out. They're doing hybrids right now, so they're not actually all back to going to church every day. They go sometimes during the week and then two nights is over video Zoom. They log in and, oh, and get this, of course, the positioning in front of the camera, because you have to be on [camera](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1096s) too. Guess who's in the front row and who's in the back?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1099s)

And that was corrected on some people's. I have insiders that have talked to me, that was corrected that if it was a family on a couch, they had to reposition themselves.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1111s)

If you're not dressed at the back.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1113s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1114s)

Yeah, the sisters, the women, have to be at the back sitting behind the men. Apparently, you can get kicked out for being like inappropriately dressed, messing around, doing stuff. We'll just kick you off, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1127s)

Because heaven forbid a woman should have a thought. I mean, that's a scary thought.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1132s)

And the rule is they've got vaccination rules in. You're not allowed in, like you're not allowed to go to meeting, to church, if you're not vaccinated. So if you're not vaccinated, you can't go. And also if you're not vaccinated, you can't go to other places like for breaks on Sundays and stuff like that. You can't interchange with other people. You have to be vaccinated.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1156s)

Oh my goodness, what a little psycho.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1166s)

What really surprises me is that they're able to keep track of the vaccinated people and the unvaccinated people. In America, that would be against HIPAA laws. They could be sued for that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1179s)

It's some form that they keep track on. I think it's checked like every Sunday or something like that, but it's checked.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1188s)

A business is not allowed to, if somebody takes time off to get a COVID test, a business is not allowed now to ask what the results of that test are. There was a lawsuit down here and somebody won several million dollars because their employer asked them if the test was positive or not. It went to court and the guy won. So that's what really shocks me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1211s)

This is a whole other area, is that brethren have absolutely zero respect for anyone's privacy or their information. Any organization, churches included, are supposed to keep a record to know all of the information they hold on any individual and to be able to produce that information if the individual requests it. Freedom of Information Act.

Of course, the church, call it the church, the [Plymouth](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1241s) Brethren Christian Church, holds vast, vast files and databases full of information on all its members. But if any former member requests under freedom of information to know what information is being held, they will get a reply saying, "We hold no information on you at all."

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1260s)

Yes, I have this from a reliable source in Australia that the Brethren priestlies are sometimes recorded and the sins that are confessed are written down, and they're saved on databases. So just let that sink in for a second. Imagine if you found out that the Catholic Church had recording devices in their confession booths. Okay? This is so wrong, it's insane.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1291s)

Absolutely. I have proof of that because when I got in trouble, they got me to write everything out. It was five or six pages. I went right back to when I was seven years old and wrote on every possible thing. This is intensely personal and humiliating, embarrassing, self-incriminating stuff. I handed it over to the priest as I was expected to. They said, "Yes, we'll send this to Mr. Bruce," and so on.

Anyway, a couple of weeks later, I get a phone call from some random brother in Australia I'd never heard of before, not even a familiar name. "Oh yeah, your case has been passed on to me." He had a whole bunch more questions about this. So my entire personal confessional was handed to a complete [stranger](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1344s). I've no doubt it was sent by electronic means, no doubt it's filed in Sydney, it's filed all over the world. That's completely illegal, as well as a betrayal of trust.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1360s)

Yes, exactly. But let's make sure our listeners know, in case there's any brethren listening, if it is a topic that you've talked to your doctor or therapist about, you do not need to talk to the priests about it or anyone else. It is between you and your doctor, you and your therapist. Priests should never ask you about medical health information, anything like that. No priest should.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1386s)

In fact, let's make it clear. You don't have to tell the priest anything at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1390s)

You can say no.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1393s)

You can say no. Exactly. But also, regardless of what your faith is, whether you are a fully biblical Christian or whether you're an atheist, let me tell you, there's nothing in the Bible that says to have your sins forgiven, you have to tell them to a priest. We've all listened to the gospel. You confess your sins to God. God clears your sins. Your local priest cannot help you in that connection. There's absolutely no scriptural basis for this idea that your sins can't be cleared unless you tell them to a priest.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1433s)

And I think this is where they lose everything. Because let's take into consideration my story. Let's say that, obviously I've made a police report. Let's say the priests go in and talk to Alan, and Alan reveals his sins, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. In their mind, he's become right. And now that pedophile, and yes, I'm going to call [him](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1463s) a pedophile, gets to go back out and walk on the street because he's just been absolved of his sin because he confessed it. But no practical change has happened.

That's why when I've done my podcast before, I've pleaded with the community of Maple Creek and with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, that that man needs help. Could you imagine if they took that kind of consideration to their actual real issues that they are having inside there versus these little [piddly](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1493s) things of like Richard Marsh and Carman?

Could you imagine if Carman's letter had been given that same kind of attention, that they would have some guy in Australia phoning up Richard and saying, "Hey, I've got your case"? That, I'm hoping that's what comes out of this podcast. Because we know that they listen from inside there. We know that they go and they find places to listen. That's what has to happen, is these big things need to be put on the table to be discussed and looked at.

It's [not](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1524s) about just talking to a priest and having your sins absolved. In their mind, you're right now, so you can go and beat and abuse whoever you want. But if you go and stay shut up for seven days, and you've talked to a priest about this, and in their mind, you're right, you're now back in, right?

I received a letter years and years ago from the main trio of priests that had really jumped on our family. The letter was all the same between all three of them, [handwritten](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1554s) and signed by them. To them, they had this idea in their head that everything's fine now. So I have written letters to my parents, to my siblings, explaining that just because you guys have changed things inside there with your rebranding and with what you're allowed to do now, as long as there is this separation and this hurt in those of the kids that have been left behind and nothing has been done to actually change these families that [are](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1586s) in complete disarray and have been pulled apart, nothing's fixed.

The problems are not fixed. I think that's the biggest delusion that they live in there, is that they have this idea that if something is written or something is spoken and it's witnessed with a priest, boom, everything's magically happening. Everything's better, right? This world is just a beautiful place to live now.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1611s)

They need to understand that a crime does not go away when you confess it to a priest. It is a fucking crime. And the police are coming after criminals. Let's just say that right. We've done our police reports, Cheryl and I.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1631s)

Oh, there's enough that have done them.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1632s)

Yeah. So let's make that clear to any brethren listeners that if you do something or a brethren member commits a crime, just because you say to a priest that you did it and you feel bad, uh-uh. You need to go to the police. Their own leaders have in the past supported going to the police, JT Jr. or whatever. You have to tell the truth. And that's what we need to implore to listeners in the [Brethren.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1663s) Come out and tell the truth.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1668s)

Well, and they need to drop this feeling that they have that the Brethren's law and order is above the police. It is not. The law of the land is above the Brethren's laws.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1683s)

Yeah, that's the one they trot out every time: "The assembly is the highest court in the universe." Well, let's say bullshit.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1691s)

Yeah. "Protect the assembly" is code for "do not tell the authorities the truth." Now remember that. If you are told you need to protect the assembly, that is code for do not tell the truth to the authorities. And that is criminal. Absolutely.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1713s)

Yeah. And if the brethren are so good as they make out to be, God's chosen people and this wonderful testimony, why would they need to hold secrets? Mr. Symington used to say, and I think it's to his credit, "We've got nothing to hide and nothing to display." Well, look at the brethren now. Look at their display of RRT and bright red tents and million-dollar websites. And boy, have they got a lot of stuff to hide.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1739s)

They're just so far from Christianity or loving that they claim to be. I listen to my guru and he's trying to tell people you should look at every human being through the eyes that you would look at your own mother. That's the kind of unity and humanity he's pushing. The opposite of unity and love is separation and division.

The number one thing that this Plymouth Brethren Christian Church [stands](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1770s) for is separation from what they say is evil. That is the opposite of unity, the opposite of love, the opposite of encompassing and compassion. There is no altruism and compassion in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1784s)

And that brings up a very important point that this whole wall of separation they talk about is a complete illusion. The mental picture they like to build is of a castle wall, and all the good people are inside and all the wicked people and the enemies are outside. If you break through the wall, the enemies will get in.

Well, of course, what we know and what we're trying to expose on this program is there's many, many very evil, very wicked people [inside](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1814s) the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Yes, pedophiles. In fact, the system itself is evil and it works together to hide and protect those evil people.

So in fact, inside the wall, you people who claim to be withdrawing from iniquity, you're actually breaking bread with all these wicked people and you're helping to hide their crimes. You're helping to protect them. So what's the point [of](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1845s) the wall? What's it separating you from? Yes, obviously there's evil outside the wall. No one's saying there are not pedophiles in the world outside of the brethren, but they're inside as well. So you're not separating yourself from anything.

The fact is that the so-called wall of separation is not there to keep the world out. It's to keep you in. It's to keep the brethren inside there so that Bruce Hales and his commercial cronies can keep milking you for more [and](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1875s) more cash. That's the only purpose of it.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1878s)

100%. Let me ask you guys all this quick question. Since you've all left, have you found the world to be more loving or more evil than you predicted?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1894s)

Absolutely more loving. You know, we had a conversation the other day, Lane, when you said something that was just the most beautiful thing. Before I say the statement, I just want to say to those that are listening that are still inside, their biggest thing that they use against you... I was told every time I had a priestly visit that if I left, they would "eat me to me and spit me out," was what we were told every [Sunday.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1924s) That was kind of drilled in there.

Your fear of leaving is like, "Well, what about my family?" Right? I'm going to have to leave my family. You've got parents, you've got all this family you have to leave behind. And yes, you do. But what price do you want for your freedom? You're literally selling your soul to the devil. Literally, you are. You have that choice, or you can leave your family and come out here.

Here's [the](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1954s) statement that Lane said. He said, "We may lose our biological family, but we gain the world as our family." That is 110% accurate. Everybody that is out there, 98% of the people out here are going to help you the way that you think that you're going to be helped inside.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1977s)

Yeah, love is out here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1979s)

The love is out here.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1980s)

So much love. So much love from perfect strangers. More compassion than I've ever seen, even in my immediate family, my extended family, my cousin. The love I've got out here, oh, it fills my heart every day.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D1997s)

And of course, the brethren have to help their own, and it's reciprocal. When you go to this brother's house for a meal, then of course you expect he's going to come back to your house for a meal. So it's always a quid pro quo. It's a two-way obligation. What amazed me when I came out is, as Lane said, perfect strangers would literally just have compassion on [you,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2027s) take you in for a meal, help you, go right out of their way, and they're not expecting anything in return.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2034s)

Yeah. The first time we went to church, I remember sitting there thinking, you know, there's so much that we're told, "The world doesn't believe this. The world doesn't know this. We as the brethren were chosen and we're special and we get shown all this stuff that the world doesn't know." Well, it was amazing. The first time we went to church, I sat there and I thought, "Wait, they're saying stuff that I've been told they don't know." It's just this shocking realization that, yeah, they do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2064s)

Yeah. The thing is, the PBCC are not the elite that they think they are, right? I understand that. I get it when you're in there. I mean, you're told that. I was talking to my paper, being told, "You know what, you're abandoning your position. God chose you to be in this with the brethren and you are messing, don't mess that up. Don't mess up the position that you were gifted with."

Well, you know what? I would much rather step outside, have to lose a family and regain my soul and be able to get the help I needed in order to be helped. Not once was I sat down and compassionately asked, "Cheryl, what is wrong? Cheryl, what's happened?" Nobody took that time to sit down and ask me what really happened to me. If I'd had somebody compassionately ask that to me, I probably would have spilled my guts.

But here it is 30 years later when, thank goodness, the documentary came out, Richard came out, where I knew this is my time. I knew I had to have a big landing pad. We had to have a big landing pad to be able to open up and be able to spill what everybody is now spilling. I'm not just an isolated story. There are many of those stories. Many who are still struggling with the idea of how to come forward and how to [present](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2150s) it and still be able to manage life.

It's hard when it's 30 years past leaving. In my case, it started when I was three years old. I'm now living what feels like this dualistic world where I'm having to bring up all of these past memories. I'm living what I felt like I was never allowed to express. At the same time, I'm trying to be this 47-year-old woman who is still looking after her husband, who still is doing all these things in life.

[So,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2180s) is it easy? It's not easy, but it's very freeing. I guarantee you, we have a very, very long list of help that can help you. I can't tell you the amount of warmth of just even within the ex-members that we have now, the amount of compassion, the amount of freedom and relief that everybody is feeling now that we've got this [platform](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2210s) that's opening up. They're ready. They're all ready to just get it off their chest and be able to get on with life.

That's what this platform is for. We want you to come on. We want you to get this off of your chest. I don't care what it is you want to talk about. If you want to sit here and come and talk for an hour about a priestly visit you got, by all means, we welcome it.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2236s)

We want to hear it. Yeah. One of my first realizations about how small the brethren were was right after I'd left, or right after being confined, which is their first level of kicking you out. I went to a football game in Montreal, and it was at the Olympic Stadium. They announced that there were 50,000 fans in the stadium. It shocked me because I realized there were [more](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2266s) people interested in this football game than there were members of the entire Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

They're nothing. They're just like a million other cults and sects out there. Guess what? When you talk to other people that have been in cults or sects, they also think that they're in the perfect right church and it's all amazing and it's blessed. They also think that they have [secret](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2296s) material or writings or teachings that they need to protect. It's just like, oh, you guys are so cliche.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2305s)

Yeah, exactly. They're just like all the others. They're just like a hundred thousand other cults all around the globe. Different names for things, different robes for the leader, but it's the same, you know, word for word, it matches up.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2323s)

Yeah, and I got a little funny thing I want to read out here. Just tell me if this sounds like a typical normal mainstream church. They have a holding corporation called Global Funding Trust. Then they use this term called the "GAP ecosystem," which basically means that we take outsiders' money and we keep it in GAP. 

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2353s)

I thought that [stood](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2353s) for Gay And Proud.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2355s)

Well, they stole it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2356s)

Oh, right.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2359s)

So then they have subcategories in this beautiful mainstream church. They have a subcategory company called Campus\&Co that runs all their grocery stores. Yes, you heard that correctly. This cult has their own grocery stores in every major city. Then you have another sub one, the Bible and Gospel Trust, that actually prints out their stupid propaganda books and their videos that you must watch and listen to.

Then they have another one, the [Universal](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2389s) Business Team, commonly known as UBT. This is their business coaching. They use it to group buy and get discounts, and really they use it to kind of control and buy parts of businesses so that they can actually have control in members' companies.

Then they have OneSchool Global, which handles all the entire church's schooling from kindergarten right up to high school, and of course, you're not allowed to go on from there. Then they have RRT, Rapid Relief Team, in multiple cities [across](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2420s) multiple continents. This is their public relations firm that helps out in cases of disaster. They hand food out to firemen. I didn't know firemen really needed food and stuff, but whatever.

Then they have Vision Accelerator. That is their private equity group that basically for their big VIPs to buy massive things and then to take over PBCC members' businesses. Then they have Community Trade Link. That's literally their [version](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2450s) of Kijiji for members to buy and sell stuff on. Then they have this lame attempt at Spotify called Trove, where it's only PBCC music allowed and all of it has to be pre-approved. Wow. I bet it's really fun, great music on there.

So they have all these things running their entire lives, their business, their food, what they see on their TV, their internet. Absolutely everything is controlled. I don't [remember](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2480s) Jesus doing anything like this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2486s)

And it goes further than that because they also have their own life insurance company and their own health insurance company. They buy all their cars through UBT-run businesses. Basically, Bruce Hales' aim is to capture the entire revenue stream of 55,000 people globally and make a profit on it. That's why he never gets your wages. You get your generous wages working for your brethren business, but then every penny you spend, you're actually spending it with the church. So he claims it all back.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2525s)

Yeah, and what is he doing at home all the time with all this money?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2535s)

Buying a million-dollar Mansion.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2538s)

Yeah, exactly. Well, that's nothing. We're talking multiple billions. Millions is peanuts. He's far, far more money than he can possibly spend. I saw this on Twitter, but I can paraphrase it and say that I personally have far more money than the entire Hales family together, because I have enough and they never will.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2564s)

Yes, how true is that. That's beautiful. So true.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2572s)

The funny thing is, they're so terrified of this place called hell, right? My opinion only, but not a real place. So they're terrified of this hell. Then you look at their lives from the outside, right? They're these multimillionaires and sometimes even billionaires, and they can't go and do anything because they're not allowed to do stuff. They can't go to countries where there are no brethren.

You're not going to see brethren members in Bora Bora. You know, you're not going to see them at a resort in Mexico or something, right? So they're locked and trapped inside their own massive mansions. I really think that when it [comes](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2611s) down to the average brethren member, when you look at how happy they should be, because they're in the one true church after all, then you look at how sad and depressed they are, and you realize, oh, they're in that hell. They're already there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2628s)

They created it.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2631s)

Yeah. They're never going to have enough money. They're sick. They've got the Levitical meetings coming up in two weeks over Zoom. Now get this. My brothers are going, my dad's going, some cousins are going. A whole bunch in Boston are going, I think, Manchester. I got a bunch of names there, but of course I remembered my brothers.

Yes, some get to only go for a day and some get to go for the full thing. But they have to go, so they go to the church and they watch it on a screen. Right? This is the big yearly meetings where Bruce Hales gives all the new orders. But not everyone can come. Only some. They say, because not everyone can understand it. Oh my. What is this amazing information? Is it about the Bible? It's just such gobbledygook. When you actually hear them speak, it's, I like to call it nonsensical rhetoric.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2713s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2718s)

I'm trying to think of some of their funny sayings. What would they say? Do you guys remember anything, funny sayings that they would say?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2730s)

Not off the top of my head. I try and forget it. We have a list though. I want to, because you're going to hear us referring to this as a cult all the time, I want you to go through why we... I mean, we lived it. We know it's a cult, but this is an actual list.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2749s)

This list is from the International Cultic Studies Association. I've been to the International Cultic Studies Association conference twice, once in Montreal, once in New Jersey. I'm 99% sure that I was withdrawn from because they found out I attended this conference, which is surprising.

Get this, at the Montreal International Cultic Studies Association conference, there were three priests there. My [uncle,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2780s) Johnny Fosse, Randy Cowie, and Derek Cowie. Now, why would the leaders of a mainstream church be at an International Cultic Studies Association conference?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2794s)

Unless they're a cult.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2795s)

Unless they're a cult. Yeah. So let's read their list and let's see how many they tick off. "The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2808s)

Well, we now know that Bruce Hales is now called the CEO, right? That's what he's being referred to as now.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2817s)

So his rule is law. That one checks off. Absolutely. Okay. Next one is "questioning, doubt and dissent are discouraged or even punished."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2828s)

Well, Carman knows that one.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2830s)

100%. They'll run you out of town on a rail.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2834s)

That's two for two. Okay. Do they use any mind-altering practices? We looked at this one and it talks about different drugs, sessions, chantings, anything like that, but it also says mediations. We discussed this and we think that mind-altering substances would definitely cover alcohol, correct? 100%, absolutely. Okay, so then it's 100%, because [like](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2864s) 90% of them are alcoholics and they even know this.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2867s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2867s)

"The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2875s)

Well, yeah, 100%.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2876s)

Hell yeah. "The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself and its leaders and its members." Uh, checkbox. Slam dunk. "The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2898s)

Yep.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2900s)

Yep. Oh, this one's really good. "The leader is not accountable to any authorities." Yeah, only to his big boy God. Him and God are pals. "The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary." Yes, anything for the assembly, protect the assembly. "The leadership induces feelings of shame and or guilt in order to influence and or control members."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2938s)

Oh, they never admit it, but they do.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2940s)

Yep. "Often this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion." I think priestly visits would fall right into that. "Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends and to radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before they joined the group." So basically, that's excommunication right there. They require you to cut communications to anyone that leaves the [church,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2970s) because we're all born into it.

"The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members." Now, at first, I was like, "No, it doesn't recruit at all." But then Richard corrected me and said no, because they are so misogynistic, they view women as basically baby makers to help the church, and that's exactly true. They're preached to have as many children as possible.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D2992s)

Yeah, which is why there are 55,000 of them. Because they ban contraceptives, they encourage large families, and that's where they all came from.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3003s)

Yeah, and the ones that don't obey and don't agree with them, just push them out on the street. That's the mentality.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3010s)

"The group is preoccupied with making money." Oh boy, oh boy.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3025s)

"Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and or group-related activities." What else do they do? Nothing. "Members are encouraged or required to live and or socialize only with other group members." Oh my, oh my. It looks like we're getting to the end of the list, folks. "The most loyal members feel there can be no life outside the context of the group."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3051s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3052s)

10 out of 10\. It looks like all of them. Slam dunk. That right there is a cult. So we've got money making, we've got hiding pedophiles. Let me repeat that. There are, I allege, because I know that they're still in the church and they abused me, so I know that there's pedophiles in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. They're hiding these things because I confessed it to the priests after I got confined. I told [them](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3090s) about the abuse and they said, "We'll look into it," and then they never spoke to me again. My dad said, "Nope, she denied it." So they've got a bunch of criminals in there. How do we deal with that?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3109s)

Shine a light on it. That's why we're here, isn't it? I think this is a really important point because just imagine a society where you could walk down the road, put a brick through the jeweler's window, help yourself to a thousand dollars worth of jewels, and none of the passersby on the street would even look around. They would just walk on. They wouldn't report you, the police wouldn't come after you. It would be chaos.

If you were a criminal, you'd think, "This is great, I can get away with this. I [can](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3139s) do this and no one's going to say anything." That is exactly how the brethren have been right up to now. The priests and the leadership, they think they can do anything to anyone who leaves, any opposer, anyone they disagree with, and everyone's going to be too afraid to speak out. We have taught them that they can get away with it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3165s)

And it stops now.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3165s)

Yeah, it stops here. This is what this podcast is about, calling them out. Not only to get redress for things that have happened in the past, but also to make it so that the very next time a so-called priest or leader thinks of doing something mean or illegal or criminal or immoral to any other of his fellow men, women or children, they are going to have [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3195s) nasty little nagging thought at the back of their mind: "What happens if that person gets on the podcast and tells the world about it?" That's how you hold them to account.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3208s)

That's what we're asking. We're asking other people that are ex-members or members that are sitting on the fence right now and thinking about leaving. Man, there's benefits to telling the truth. You know, you feel better. Coming forward doesn't feel like crap because people are there to help you. Is it hard? Is it easy? No, but it's relieving to tell the truth. I know that there's people listening to these things and they know the [terrible](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3238s) things they've done. If they could just find the strength to go to the cops, the cops are waiting. They're waiting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3246s)

Yeah, or contact us and we'll give you cops that will listen to you. We'll give you numbers. I think it's just a matter of understanding that the time is now where you have to take a stance. If you're not changing things, and I say this to my family, I say this to my siblings, I say this to everybody that is in there, that if you are not changing things and if you believe that you are above the [law](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3276s) and Alan is still roaming the streets of Maple Creek, you're a part of the issue. You are a part of the issue.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3286s)

Cheryl, do we know whether he is still, has he been kicked out or confined, anything?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3291s)

From what I've heard, no. Someone had told me that he was still going to meeting. When we talk about telling the truth, so when I did my plea statement, the truth, I had to let all of my walls down and let, I mean, it was the hardest thing I ever did to let that truth, let the whole truth come out again. I knew that when the truth is spoken, you cannot wash it away. You cannot pay it off. It only grows power, right? I have to be patient. [Absolutely.](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3321s)

Right up until the other day now where the Hutterites are now considering speaking up because they saw my podcast and they know what went on. They know what's going on. If we're ever going to make any kind of a difference, you have to stare fear in its eyes and realize it's just a freaking fake bark, right? Your fear is just what is programmed into you. The [truth](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3351s) is way more powerful. Change comes from when you speak the truth.

I get very frustrated. I get so frustrated to know that if they believe that they're above the law. We know they've seen my podcast. I know my brothers have watched it. I know my siblings have watched it. I don't know if my parents have, but I know that there are people within there that have seen this podcast. If you have seen the freaking podcast and you're allowing Alan still to be wandering around, you're part of the problem. What if your child was the next one? I can tell you that he still is doing what he's doing. His hands are still roaming free.

It's just not right. It's not right. So if you guys can't take matters into your own hands and deal with shit, this is what you're getting. You're getting a bunch of ex-members who are all standing up and saying, "It's done. We're done." That doesn't mean we're bitter, it doesn't mean we're resentful, it means that accountability has to happen. Accountability does not mean sitting in a living room full of men and witnessing people telling their sins. No, we're talking that the [crimes](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3429s) have to be dealt with.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3432s)

Absolutely. You're not just helping yourself by speaking out, you're helping other people. Really, really importantly, there are nearly 9,500 children in the Brethren. Probably if you include the children right down to babies, there's 10,000 children in that Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. There are no social barriers. There's no kind of social responsibility about being protective against [possible](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3464s) pedophile activity.

If you're in the church or if you've left the church and you know that someone in there is a pedophile or any of that kind of activity against children, if you keep quiet, that person is enabled to carry on in the community molesting people. You're responsible to speak out if you know about this, because the reason to speak out is to protect those children who are in there. They're not being protected [at](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3498s) the moment because the church hides these things. They allow pedophiles to continue. That's 10,000 children around the globe. How many of them have been abused today of those 10,000 children? It's not just Alan Drever. We know many, many cases all around the globe where there have been pedophiles in the church and in many cases, they're still in there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3525s)

And Alan Drever wasn't even just children. We know current cases where it's grown women, right? It's grown women that he just feels entitled to. We have to find our voice. Especially with the women, it's hard. Even after you leave, it still carries on of, "How do I find my voice? How do I let my voice [say](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3555s) what it needs to say?"

I know I'll wake up tomorrow morning after doing this podcast and I'll have my vulnerability hangover and question everything that I said, but every time it gets easier. It gets easier because I'm taking back my power. Especially the women that leave the brethren and the women that leave most cults that keep the women very much contained, is that the more practice you have, the more you find your [courage](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3586s) and get up and just say the tiniest little thing.

These podcasts aren't necessarily one-on-one. We've created them to be conversation. It's an easy way for us to step in. There could be six, seven of us on here, if that's what you want, to have conversation and to make it light, to make it easy. But in any way, shape, or form, we have to start finding our voice. All of us have to start finding our voice. We will help you in whatever way to be able to help you find [that](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3616s) voice, help you work through the fears of finding that voice, and help you after. We're here for you.

That includes those that are in, that includes those that are trying to leave, that includes those that have been out for 40 years. Because we do know that the backpacks have to come off. We have to unzip them. We've got to shake the crap out of them and we have to be able to move on. But we can't fully move on with this if we're always keeping this tucked away somewhere, or if we've drank it away before. We've got to find that point to be able to sit and say, "You know what, there's enough of us now to be able to sit down, hold hands, and not necessarily sing kumbaya, but let's [let](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3665s) it unfold."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3669s)

And that can be anything.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3670s)

We have a new email, we'll give it to you guys at the end, but email us what you want to talk about. We've had lots of discussion of topics that we want to talk about, from the discipline process to alcoholism, to how they treated women, to what happened in the priestly business, what it was like to be shut up, what it was like to be withdrawn from, what happened after you were withdrawn from, what kind of therapy got you through, what therapy has been useful, and what could be useful for other people.

It's about us [coming](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3700s) on here and really sharing our tools. We're all in this together and not even just the PBCC. We would love to invite other people on from other cults. We know we've got Jehovah Witnesses, we've got people from other religions that are very much similar to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. We're inviting all ex-members from very religious sects that have not been able to be who you are. We invite you all on here. We want to make this a movement.

It is not about, we're not sitting here trying to poke fun at religion. It's not. This is about healing. This is about healing for us once and for all. We all have been waiting for this. There are ways to work with police for safety. I'm very safe. There are ways to do it to keep your safety. Sure, yes, they can mess with your computer, they can mess with your service to your house, they have ways that they can sit there and be a pesky mosquito, but there are ways around things. Go ahead, Lane.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3787s)

No, that was good. I was just going to say, I know because I talked to ex-members and I talked to people who are in the church all the time, and there's sometimes a big love of money. They define success as the amount of wealth and square footage you have in your house. If you're thinking of leaving and you want to be a billionaire and you want to be super, super rich, I'm telling you, you chose the wrong thing then, because that's not what life is about.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3816s)

It's not.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3817s)

It's not about money. What it was about for me was going on my first all-inclusive vacation and scuba diving in the Caribbean and going, "Oh, my brothers are never going to do this." Right? Then my first time at an orchestra, I was like, "Oh man, my dad would love this, but he'll never see this either."

So if you want to judge success purely on money and how many businesses you can own and how many cars and how big your house can get, [then](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3847s) stay in the Brethren. You probably have a good chance of succeeding at that. But if you want to do things like actually live a life and become anybody you want, right? You can put on and play any role and character you want in life, then leave the Brethren and go and explore and try things for the first time.

Like, goodness gracious, sailing on a boat or something, or jump out of a plane, or climb a mountain, or go on a vacation, or [go](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3878s) to a restaurant and have, guess what, they're not going to know what this is, it's called sushi. Only the Japanese can make it properly. Trust me, you've never had it. Think of the cuisine they're just never going to eat, and that just warms my heart.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3900s)

And you only live once. The thing that terrified me after a certain point when I was in the brethren, I saw these old brothers. In fact, I'll tell you who it is. It was David Vos. He was an old South African brother who had never done anything wrong his entire life. He had an incredible knowledge of scripture. He had been a sort of a semi-heavy, I think he'd taken one or two fellowship meetings. In the reading, he would open up the scripture and he would get very animated and enthusiastic and eloquent.

But he actually worked for the family business. When [he](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3939s) wasn't actually in the meeting, he was the picture of misery. He would shuffle around saying, "Oh, dear, oh, dear." Then he would go to his computer when he was supposed to be working and he'd be scrolling through priestly emails about other people's sins. This was the guy who was right at every turn, at every juncture of the testimony, he supported the right guy.

I thought, you know, the funny thing [was,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D3970s) he had a family, had kids, they didn't really like the guy. They had absolutely zero respect for him. But all the heavies and all the adjoining lackeys thought this guy was great because when they saw him in the meeting, he was this animated chap and he would talk about eternal life. The guy didn't have a life. It was just a little rush of enthusiasm that he's on the front row, he's got the microphone, [and](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4000s) he sort of stirs up this enthusiasm.

The guy was miserable. He was miserable. I thought, "Well, this guy has done everything right for the whole of his life and this is what he's got. He's got a crummy little house, he's got a wife who barely speaks to him, he's got kids who don't respect him, and he's miserable." I thought, "Well, if I had done everything right, this is the best I've got to look forward to, this kind of miserable old age with nothing to look forward to [but](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4031s) taking a final ride in the brethren's hearse."

That terrified me. You only have one life. Imagine getting to the end of your life, and never mind you've got $10 million in your bank account, you look back at your life and you say, "Well, all I've done in my life is make money for Bruce Hales. I've never been here. I've never been there. I've never climbed a mountain. I've never scuba dived. I've never done all the things in [God's](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4061s) creation that I could have experienced. All I've done is attend meetings and make money and give it to Bruce Hales." That's terrifying.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4071s)

That is so terrifying. You're right. The thing is, they shouldn't be like that old man because they're in the one true church that was chosen by God. So every single member, and remember this, brethren members that are listening, you should be much happier than the Dalai Lama. You should make the Dalai Lama look depressed because you're in the one true church and you have Bruce Hales. So if you're not the happiest people on Earth, then maybe [it's](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4102s) not the one true church.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4104s)

I mean, they've got everything because they've got all the spiritual blessings because they are God's chosen people, this tiny leaf, plus they've got far more money than anyone else. These people should be bouncing off the ceiling with joy. The fact is that basically the choice they make every day is, "Do I overdose on alcohol or antidepressants, or maybe just mix them into a cocktail?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4131s)

Who gets to be with drunk driving today?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4134s)

I'd advise them to get a blender because it sort of breaks down the pills and it goes down more smoothly in the scotch.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4141s)

They drink their propaganda every night at about 7:15 p.m. in church. They got to repeat it to themselves over and over and over. You got to repeat it like a mantra, like a moral workshop. It's just a mantra, that's all it is. People do it all the time. You can say good ones. You can look in the mirror every morning, you can say, "I'm a loving, nice, kind person and I want the world to be loving." Or you can look and say, "[I'm](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4171s) a piece of shit. I'm a piece of shit."

That's what the brethren want you to do. They want you to look in the mirror and say, "A wretched person that I am." That's disgusting. Don't you believe that God made you? Why would he make something disgusting? Their own contradictions and their own beliefs are ridiculous. Imagine teaching people self-hatred instead of self-love. It's so gross.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4201s)

I think the biggest thing that anybody in there can do is that instead of having the saying, "What would Bruce do?" it should be, "What would Jesus do?" That's what you need to switch. That's the first thing you need to switch, is that saying. Because there is nowhere in the Bible does it say that you are supposed to switch out those two. From the sounds of it, it is not anymore "What would Jesus do?" [It](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4231s) is "What would the CEO do?" which is in this term now, the CEO equals Bruce Hales. Come on.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4240s)

Do they think they're fooling people with CEO?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4242s)

Yeah, I just, that one's a really hard one for me to digest in the sense that, okay, you go back to JTJr., the whole thing between mixing commerce and the church is just unheard of. But yet you go how many years later now, when now the church is the business? I would love to have had the conversations with my parents now. If I could just call them up and be like, "Are you kidding me? [Like,](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4272s) what kind of glasses are you wearing?" I understand you've got probably 30 grandkids in here, but come on, get them all out. You literally are working for somebody. This is no longer a Christian church. It's just not.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4289s)

An ex-member said it perfectly to me recently. He said the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have become "pay to play." You gotta pay to play.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4300s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4300s)

Right? Money goes up. How come it never comes down? Have they asked themselves that? Why have they never got handouts of cash for how rich everyone's becoming? Why are they always sending money up? Sounds like a mafia to me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4313s)

Yeah. And it's knowing too that you have a choice. When you're told something, you don't have to take it at its word, right? You have a choice to investigate. Let's go back to the five people at Stephen Harper's acceptance speech. I know that you guys are being told inside there that they were there to offer, let him know that they were offering their support and [prayers](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4343s) for him.

Why would five people be in the front row of Stephen Harper's acceptance speech to tell him that they're praying for him? Could they not just call him? You have to use some logic here. That's not true. They're feeding you a line of bullshit. I'm being told by my siblings and anybody I talk to, "Oh, Cheryl, you know, 99.9% of everything you hear, it's just false. It's lies." That's what they tell you, that everything is lies.

I can guarantee you that I know [more](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4375s) about what is happening inside your four walls than you do. So you should be listening to what we are saying. Even if you don't believe it, I challenge you to open up and actually listen.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4394s)

Don't be a scaredy pants. Don't be scared of hearing the truth. If you're in there listening to this, listen to the truth. Listen to Cheryl's story, and as heart-wrenching as it is, listen to all of it. Listen to my story, listen to Richard's story, listen to Carman's story. There's nobody lying out here. Nobody wants to hurt Bruce Hales, okay? As much as he'd like you to believe that there's snipers out there. The idea of [counter-snipers](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4424s) for Bruce Hales is the funniest thing I've heard in many years and it still makes me laugh a lot. I'll just let you know, there are no snipers out for Bruce Hales. Anyway, I lost my train of thought.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4438s)

When you've been broken the way that we have been broken and been able to repair those broken bones and stand back up, this is not about retaliation. I wish I could just scream that from every fiber of my being to everybody inside there. This is not about retaliation. This is about transformation. You need to reform what's happening there, and there has to be accountability. That is what we are based on. That's what this is about. So as much as you want to say that we're lying, or these are lies, and we're just opposers that are gathering steam, it has nothing to do with that. This is about healing.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4480s)

Yeah. And if we're full of crap, be respectful, but come on the show and tell us how you feel and we'll talk about it. Because your opinion is going to be valued. We're not going to be mean or rude. If you're an ex-member, please reach out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4502s)

Yeah, we would love to.

### [**Lane**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4503s)

Let's have some more people on and let's have more of these conversations.

I know it sounds like we sat here and did a plea for the people inside, which it was. Because we know that they're listening. But we also wanted to just make sure that you guys, all the ex-members, are aware that we want to invite you all in to start this healing process on a global level and to be able to just come on and find your voice, tell your story, and just be [amongst](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4536s) all of us that are all trying to do the same thing.

There really isn't an end game in this. I tell my therapist that all the time, that I'll probably be 95 years old and still having a trigger, and that's okay. That's totally okay. I've got my back, I know I have support, and as long as you have those two things, you can get through anything.

Awesome. Well guys, this has been great. Do you think that's it for a first episode? I think so. I think that's covered a lot of ground. Awesome. Let's do another one soon and let's have more topics that we can cover.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=kPZTc7LxM1s%26t%3D4574s)

And hopefully we'll have some ex-members joining us. Okay, take care you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
