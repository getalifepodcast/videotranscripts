## Summary

Trigger Warning- Discussion on child sexual abuse, Satanism and esoteric sexuality. Viewer discretion is advised.
Ben Woodbury joins us for a discussion on OneSchool Global. He shows us very disturbing messages he's received from concerned teachers and citizens. We dive into the concerns and questions that  every parent should have in any schooling system. Why would a school go through 6 principals in 5 years? What is Massimo Introvigne, a well-known cult apologist and scholar of Satanism, doing at a Christian school that believes in keeping separate from evil? Why would teachers find alcohol in water bottles in grades 7 & 8 and changes not made? We have firsthand reports of disappeared fellow staff members being one of the most demoralizing things about working for the PBCC school system. We hear of a kinder teacher candidate recognizing and calling out signs of sexual abuse in little children with nothing being done about it. We also dive into how the Frank news reported on the latest accident in Australia.What would you expect a mainstream Christian Church that separates itself from the evil of the world, to be like? Join us in trying to understand how this school can still remain running.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=17s)

Hello everyone, welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are here today with Carman and Ben is joining in as a guest today. So welcome Ben. We have um a lot of things that we're going to try and cover with OneSchool Global and some stuff from the PBCC Frank News but first of all we just want to touch briefly on uh Ben had a death threat that happened to him and so I'll let Ben just kind of give an update on that [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=47s) where that all went after it happened so yeah go ahead Ben.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=52s)

Well thank you, I'm alive, safe, and well. Um and yes seriously though, I did, I had a death threat as most of you probably are aware and I have it recorded. So I went to the police and the police have taken it very seriously and I've explained my situation and I have even shown them screenshots of previous abusive messages that I've received in helping people leave. Obviously people get [heated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=82s) and send me messages so I've got those to sort of give it credit or clout. Um and so they have taken it very seriously and they, yeah, it's a work in progress. 

Once we find out who it is, it's just, it's a bit of a process because that was obviously a “no caller ID”. So what the police do, and if you're listening and in the Brethren, you are not protected because you call on no caller ID. You, everyone, everything's traceable. That's the beauty of technology. Um so [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=112s) basically reach out to my service provider who reaches out to the service provider that contacted them with that number and time and then they get the number and then the person, um and then we take it from there. But that's an update, perfect, thanks. And I will update with who it was because obviously I will be getting that person charged and yeah, I'll keep you updated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=137s)

Yeah, so I mean as infallible as they feel in there, right, there, you know, we do, we take these things seriously.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=144s)

100% and and and it's important that we do take these things seriously. And anybody that is listening that has been threatened or anything at all, you you must take these things seriously because it is just one, um you know, it might not be the general uh consensus or that I, I don't believe there was a hit out on me, but I do believe that it's one fanatic, it's one extremist. And that's, we've had that scenario over and over with the mass shootings. It's not Christianity as a whole, it's one [extreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=175s) Christian that's gone and shot up a nightclub in Orlando or whatever it was. You know, that that there are people that will take it that extreme and you have to take these things seriously.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=183s)

And I think that's the thing that Bruce Hales doesn't realize is that there, I mean we've heard from the insides over the last couple weekends and the last little bit of how extreme he's getting with his fervent prayers of our silencing and removals, that he needs to watch himself. He's got to watch himself because all it takes is one teenager who's been drinking or who's fed up or who's frustrated and goes out and does his job, right? Like he's, and [Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=213s) will be held responsible for it all. We'll make sure of that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=217s)

A hundred percent. And you cannot, and this is what I've explained to my uncle when I helped a young girl escape and I had a very abusive message and, and very abusive interactions physically with the father and the mother showing up to all of our workplaces and going nuts basically. And I had this conversation with my uncle saying, you know, he needs to take accountability and blah, blah.

 And they they came back with this email, and I should actually share this at some stage, but saying that [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=247s) we don't condone this, we we do not, he acted on his own accord, he's not representative of the Brethren. But the issue is here, you can't take and control somebody's whole life like you do and not take accountability or responsibility for the bad things. You can't just be like sharing photos of them as good Christian, you know, peculiar people, zealous for good works, out doing the rapid relief teamwork, RRT, you know, these good people representing the Plymouth Brethren [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=277s) only take responsibility for that because you control their whole life. So you have to take accountability and responsibility when they act out on, you know, they're acting out because they think their daughter is being snatched by the devil. That's your faith that instilled that belief in them and therefore they're acting on that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=292s)

And especially when he is so loud right now with asking for the removal of us and the removal of the opposers and the silence of opposers. Like when you put those words into 50,000 different minds, those 50,000 different minds are going to interpret that. And you get one, you take one Bruce Hales lover who just wants to go out there and do the job for him, right? Like it's just, that's what he just needs to realize how careful he needs to be [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=323s) what he's implementing in his services.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=326s)

Yeah, and he's really got nothing to lose. Like to him, he's got nothing to lose. Like he's got a myriad of men that literally, for want of a better expression, literally ask for all to try and get the next position closest to him. So they will, you know, and I remember my priest saying to me, I would die for our brother. So it's that mentality that is instilled in you from youth, you know, you will be a Christian crusader. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=352s)

Well, and it's important to, you know, if you call yourself a mainstream Christian church, praying for the removal or the silencing of people is completely contrary to Christianity. Christianity says you pray for your enemies, you you know, you pray for their restoration or their changing of their minds, not the removal or the silencing. That is completely contrary to any mainstream Christian church there is.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=378s)

And I think it's such an important thing to touch on, particularly if you're inside the Brethren listening to this. Okay, it's me speaking. You can have your opinion and call me an apostate. I will happily take that label. I'm comfortable with that. But you've got to look at the facts. You are and you have been advised. And I experienced that myself growing up, having special prayer meetings to pray for the removal of apostates or opposers. But that very action you're teaching your children is highly toxic and [highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=408s) problematic for a child to grow up thinking that's okay. If somebody doesn't, you know, isn't aligning with my beliefs, I can pray for their removal. This is how you get a society that is so toxic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and that don't accept any other religion but their own because you're instilling these beliefs from a child to pray for the removal of, which is essentially the death of, the murder of. So you've got to think if you've got kids and you're in there, what are you raising your children in a society like that for? I think it's an important thing to think about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=445s)

And I think this is what this whole podcast is kind of geared towards today is more towards having the parents look at what their children are in, right? What do you want your children around? We've got some explicit stuff that we want to share with you. So this is definitely, you know, viewer discretion is required with what we're going to show and talk about. But it's just for all those people in there that are listening to this, it's just sit back with an open mind and be like, is this what I want my child around? Is this what I want my children hearing? Is this what I want my children, are these the guests [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=482s) I want my children to be having at school? That's what we want you to all have. So Ben has had, um, yeah, go ahead.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=488s)

Yeah, I was going to say on that too, like take us, we're just messengers. We're just delivering what we're presented with and what we've seen. Yes, we have our own opinions on that, but you can form your own from this. And what we're presenting today is some messages that we've received from outsiders, not from us that have left, not from ex-members, from outsiders that have witnessed this. And these are your children they're talking about. These are the environments in which you're putting your children in and keeping them in.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=519s)

Yeah. So we're going to start off. So Ben started a TikTok account, um, what, a couple months ago, um, yeah, and it's doing very well. It's exploding with everybody reaching out to him. Um so we are going to, we're going to start off and we're going to just share some messages that Ben's received to start with.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=540s)

And these messages, obviously I've kept the usernames and the people at their discretion just to protect them because obviously they've witnessed the death threat thing and are a bit nervous. And excuse me, I do have a lot of other people that have reached out, um, which I haven't shared yet, but this is just a couple.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=558s)

Um, I just got to figure out how to make this a full screen. Oh, here we go.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=569s)

We can see it full screen. Okay, perfect. Do you want to read it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=576s)

Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, you explain this one.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=577s)

So I put my glasses on, my good set of eyes. So somebody reached out to me and basically said she's happy for me to share this. She witnessed this and other teachers have witnessed this. This is here in Australia and it kind of hit close to home to me because obviously I, she told me other details so I know who this was and I knew this family. So basically she says;

 "Hey, I'm a kinder teacher and when I was at uni placement, there were several Brethren attending the school, children, apparently a big deal due to the rules, but they had things in place like they could only have their meals at their own table, etc."

 Which, you know, if you went to a public school, you were like, I was taken home for lunch. This was normal.

 "Anyway, I witnessed highly sexualized play from these children that was well above what their level of knowledge could be, which made it obvious that they witnessed or experienced [sexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=632s) encounters. I brought it up with a mentor teacher and she said they were well aware and reporting it constantly to child protection, but nothing was happening as a result." 

And she's asked;

 "Is this something that is common? Is there a lot of hidden sexual assault of children? Or is this a once-off thing?"

And then she goes on to the next slide to explain that the kids would basically only play together, exclude from other play, just play to really messed up family. 

"And knowing what I know about child development and play, this wasn't good. The poor teachers that had to watch, and knowing that there was nothing that was happening, I was there for two weeks and it affected me, let alone being there for a year or two." 

The parents would basically say when they reported it to the parents, which I'll explain more about that, they would say;

"Oh, it's just kids being kids, we'll talk [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=684s) them." 

But I don't know if you can see from the picture, but down below it says that they were literally role-playing oral sex on dolls, which is not the kids being kids at all. So I knew this family and they were moved and kept together whilst it's obvious from this that one of the parents or someone they were close to were being sexually abused. And just because I know more about the story, I know it was one of the parents and the Brethren kept them together. 

And this is the issue I think, and that this is why we're bringing it up, is that there is no reporting or no, it's not taken seriously. It's not, they aren't, from what we've seen, they aren't um, child, you can [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=731s) something to child protection services or something like those organizations here in Australia in particular. Yet from what I've heard, they can't do any more than alert the parent. 

And it's really hard and it's a really difficult thing to navigate because often, more often than not, it is one of the parents, and in this case it was. So they just up and move them to another school, and which is what they did. You know, they were brought up here to New South Wales to somewhere very close to me and again, you witnessed a very dysfunctional family being held [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=761s) because the Brethren don't allow divorce. They don't allow this, um, what would be not considered normally in the real world to either report this and have that parent put and dealt with like properly. Um and at the end of the day, it's the children that suffer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=778s)

Yeah, okay, let's go on to the next one here. You've got another.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=796s)

Okay, this was another person that reached out saying;

 "Hi Ben, I have a little insight into the cult, I'm a teacher..." 

And and then she goes on; 

“ I only just discovered your TikTok and making my way through your videos. You made one about where you discuss children being sent to live with other families. We used to live, we used to have, sorry, posters up in classrooms at the school that outlined behavioural management. The ultimate punishment for a non-compliant student…"

This is in the Brethren schools, this is the schools that you Brethren and your kids do. 

"The ultimate punishment for a non-compliant student was for them to be sent to another campus. I remember being horrified that the other teachers, all non-Brethren of course, weren't disturbed by it. I also watched the video where you responded to someone who has worked for a Brethren and suggested that they didn't know what was going, that I didn't know what was going on because I had left seven years ago and things have changed. The absolute [worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=856s) thing about working at a Brethren school where the people who work there have no insight into what is going on."

And I explained in that video, basically, of course, you're not going to see the worst of the Brethren. They put on their best face or best front at work because they are literally held accountable by outsiders because they're working with them. 

"So and then from from my perspective, the community members are brainwashed and really don't know any better. After a few years, I came to believe that the only…" 

This is such an interesting point [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=886s) note. 

"...after a few years…" 

And this woman's opinion, she said;

"...after a few years, I came to believe that the only people who can successfully work in that environment are those that hold similar beliefs, i.e. a racist, um, sexist, or homophobic."

 So next, next slide. So that was a really interesting point and to have that like from an ex-teacher of a OneSchool to say that because she was explaining that she was like, how do people stay in these schools? [How](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=916s) do people stay in these environments where, particularly schools, because I guess the workplace, you're not really coming across, you're coming across people, you're not dealing with um children that are, you know, growing up and exploring or finding out about themselves. You're dealing with adults that have been brainwashed for years basically. 

So working in a school environment would be a lot different because you're growing, you're basically teaching children, um, learning who are curious. And it was a really interesting point that she said [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=946s) the only people who can successfully work in those environments are people that hold similar beliefs that are racist, sexist, homophobic. I just thought, actually, that's true. That I 100% believe that because I think about the teachers that I grew up like when I went to OneSchool, or MET they called it back then, the teachers that have stayed there would be of similar beliefs. Um, yeah, it's just a really interesting, and I've had conversations with teachers that have left that I'm friends with now and they share, it's just the same thing said a different way. Yeah, very interesting point.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=985s)

I think we had an interesting conversation along that same line with a principal and she said she was the sixth principal in five years. And you know, you ask her like, what would cause that much turnover? And in even a higher paid position like a principal. And she said, well, you have to realize that this teaching environment is so harsh and because you either [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1015s) to conform to the Brethren rules and ideology or you don't succeed. It's just as simple as that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1023s)

Yeah. So there's there's somebody quite high up in OneSchool that was a teacher at my school. And an interesting observation that some teachers that have made and said to me their opinion is that she has, this teacher that is now high up in OneSchool is literally being brainwashed by the Brethren. She's literally like a clone Brethren but just not Brethren. That was just a really interesting observation to make. I'm like, yes, they would have got her at a vulnerable stage in her life and made it better by money or a position of power and yeah, they've got her.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1060s)

Her next statement here is very familiar. It's, I mean, a lot of people who either work for the Brethren or the principals and teachers all say this next part that she says here. She talks about; 

"All power to you. I feel scarred just from working there and wish I didn't know anything about them."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1076s)

Yeah, yeah. And and I think she goes on to the next slide. I think there's more to it as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1084s)

This is the next one.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1084s)

Yeah. So she said it must have been, um, she said;

 "I remember when I first started working there, the year nine students…" 

So these are kids that are 14 and 15 years old.

"...created videos for their health class that were played in an assembly. The videos were to educate about the dangers of drink driving. Nobody but me seemed even slightly concerned that the kids were not only drinking beers, but also actually driving the car." 

These are children, underage drinking and underage driving.

"There was not even an adult supervising, so no way at all was it legal. The health teacher also received a phone call from the Victorian police here in Australia because one of the kids had contacted them asking to borrow the police car." 

The audacity. 

"They don't wear seat belts and more than once I had to report a student on his L plate driving a school bus full of kids while the mum that should have been driving…" Nnext slide I think.

 "...was sitting in the back, um, was the mum that should have [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1142s) driving was sitting in the back while another student sat in the passenger seat with a baby on their lap."

 Which really reminds me, like, makes me think about the incident that we've all just heard about where the young guy killed, from reckless drink driving, killed other family members. Which is, you know, every year I feel like we hear about something like that, the dangers, the toxic drinking culture within the Brethren. And then she said, she goes on to here to talk about something really interesting;

 "Some of the kids were so anxious at school, it was heartbreaking. I often find myself wondering if the whole religion isn't just some elaborate tax evasion scheme." 

Which is not the first you have, make have that opinion.

 "[Am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1189s) I right thinking that all businesses are actually centrally owned?" 

Well, you know, that's another interesting observation.

 "I can't remember what it's called, but they have a big training facility in Sydney."

 I think she'd be referring to UBT. 

"The schools do in-house professional development in the same place, full of middle-aged men and unmarried girls bringing them tea. Very disturbing." 

Well, let's just hope it's tea. I've heard they do have a Scotch trolley every now and then, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1220s) you know, that may be hearsay. 

"I used to get so frustrated with the teachers who would work there and happily turn a blind eye. They shouldn't be allowed to run their own school. They don't maintain proper duty of care. At one point, there was a bit of a romance happening between two year 12 students. I approached the school leaders as it was clear the girl particularly and the sisters and the cousins of the students involved were all being ostracized and bullied by the whole school. Nothing was done by the school teachers. The girl was eventually taken into a meeting with a CA, (a Brethren man.) There was no [situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1251s)…" 

This is so important to know because this is, this sort of stuff used to happen to me with the Brethren CAs or the Brethren principals. 

"There is no situation in a normal school where a female student would have a meeting with a male alone. She came out very distressed. They threatened to send her to live interstate with another family." 

And this is really like their go-to with, you know, children misbehaving. I remember an incident where I was, you know, a naughty kid and multiple of [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1281s) where I was taken to that office with the Brethren CA or principal they used to call it back then, and he would sit on the opposite side of the desk and literally bully you into tears and threaten you with all sorts of ways that shouldn't be, you shouldn't be threatened with. Like it's not religion. Like so you can't do that. And that's up to the parents. Like it's a school, and I know it might be a religious school, but to sit there and threaten, you know, all sorts of [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1311s) eternal damnation and the rapture, you know, you want to be here for the rapture, like to a kid in year seven, was really traumatising. And then she goes on to say;

 "There are so many dodgy situations, teachers being sacked for mandatory reporting students with unexplained injuries, mothers who everyone knew were being abused, but nobody did anything to help. And now the student reported to a teacher, not me, that they were questioning their sexuality and shared that information and shared information that gave the [teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1341s) reason for them to be concerned for their well-being. Despite it being a legal requirement, that teacher couldn't do anything for a fear of revealing this to the Brethren would put the kid in more danger." 

So that's another really important point. Like I remember growing up in the Brethren school and obviously I knew I was, I was gay. I I knew that at nine, but questioning your sexuality and, and having nobody to talk to about it and even hinting at it to a teacher, nothing was done further because they're too afraid that the fear that the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1371s) have over these teachers, because they'll lose their jobs. And, also it doesn't look good if you, that they wouldn't like, you can't like losing a job in, in, in a professional industry is hard enough, let alone something like a school. Like it, yeah, it can carry a bit of an ambiguity as to why you lost your job and would be a very hard one to explain. Like why would you have worked there in the first place, I guess. So yeah, there's some very real concerns from it. 

And this, the point I want to make here is these are just two examples I've shared out of the myriad of messages. To give you some idea of numbers, one of the videos I posted has had like 1.5 million views. I haven't even gotten back to all of the messages, questions around all of this. Like there have been so many people reach out, not just from Australia, because this is obviously a worldwide reach, like from UK, from [everywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1428s) And it's really disturbing because the general common denominator here is the same. These schools are extremely homophobic, extremely racist. They're extremely misogynistic. And so are the teachings. And so are the people they kind of, you know, prefer to employ. It seems to be the general opinion of OneSchool Global.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1453s)

And it seems that like from our conversations that we've had with principals and teachers is it seems to be that the boys get away with a lot. And the kids, I mean, the kids get away with a lot in a sense, right? Because the children, the children have their parents to protect them. And especially if your parents are high up on the hierarchy system, you pretty much can get away with anything. And those teachers and principal can't do anything about it. That's what we were told. Like that's our, one of our last conversations [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1483s) we had with a principal, that was what it was. And she also told us that, that they're not allowed to give out grades less than 50%. She said like they could go in there and put a little dot on a piece of paper and then you have to give them 50% for that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1498s)

Well, I'm a little bit annoyed that that wasn't in place when I was in school. I appreciated that, particularly in maths.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1510s)

Yeah, um, I'm just going through some of the notes that we just...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1513s)

That again isis is Brethren manipulating the curriculum. I remember having a conversation with the teacher about in science, like it was a very like hard topic, you know, were we allowed to to study or in year 11, 12 were we not. And I remember like parts of the curriculum where it talks about evolution, Charles Darwin theory, we literally were told the name and that is it. Like it was never, we were, and I remember the fear of the teacher trying to teach it to us and I knew [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1543s) knew about this topic and I knew how to do it was so I was inquisitive for that reason and it just really, yeah, highlighted how much the Brethren edit or manipulate the curriculum to serve their thought, like they're teaching their way of life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1559s)

And we'll come back to this in a little bit because we're actually, we're going to talk about Massimo Introvigne today and actually one of the things that he accredited the PBCC to doing is he accredited them that they even taught the Darwin theory, right? He actually says that they that they do that. So I could just imagine um how little of it that they teach, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1583s)

Yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1584s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1584s)

One of the teachers that I remember, that one teacher that we spoke to, we asked her what, as, and she was an ex-staff member at that point, we asked her what was the most demoralizing thing that you found about working at one of these schools? And she said that the number one gripe that she had is teaching young girls and young boys. The young girls were undoubtedly the smartest young ladies she had ever taught. And they would come into the classroom [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1615s) these goals of, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a nurse, I want to be a teacher, veterinarian, watch them and follow them for a couple years. And as they grew up inside the church, they realized they would never be a doctor, they would never be a nurse. And then watching them accept this and just quit striving to do so good because they were never going to go anywhere. Their only, their only hope in life was to either be a secretary for [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1645s) husband or to be a stay-at-home mom or a, you know, a brother...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1650s)

...sort of a position inside the Brethren, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1653s)

Yeah, like they never are allowed to go to university, so they'll never be doctors, nurses.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1658s)

And she said it was Harvard quality brightness. Like she said, Harvard quality that some of these girls had.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1665s)

Yeah, definitely. I can vouch for that. The girls in my class were particularly bright. They were, the girls in my class were the smartest, like amongst the smartest women I've met. Like, and it, and it really, I can relate to that too, that, that whole mentality of what's this for? I used to have those thoughts myself when I didn't do well at math and didn't try because, or certain topics, because I was like, well, for what to what? I've got a job lined up. I don't need a career, I don't need this. And essentially you do lose that hope. You do lose that [sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1700s) to a strive.

And I guess that's the whole point of learning and teaching and schooling is to want something, like to be able to get into college or university. And for, you know, some of, I think they did offer at one point an ATAR where you, it's a thing here in Australia where you can get, you know, accreditation to to be able to pursue to uni, but it was very much discouraged. It was like, we're never using this, you know, you're not allowed to use this. So why would you do it? And I think Cassie, even Cassie Davies touched on that in her podcast about, you know, and she would be somebody that would, I 100% believe would be a scholar. Like she is very intelligent and all, you know, the same thing where I think they were, you know, not not allowed to get grades or pursue that in the university level.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1751s)

Yeah, this was her flip side of that was the boys would come in and they had absolutely no drive. They didn't care. The only thing they were there to do was to fulfill their number of hours to be there because their goal in life was to just go out and be in their daddy's business and make money. And no desire for knowledge. They were already had a preplanned course. And the number one goal in life was to make money.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1779s)

Yeah, no, 100%. And that that is the, that is your thought process. I can say that for my own personal experience. You did not strive. The only thing that I ever strived, like enjoyed, was arts or craft or, you know, something creative, um, which, you know, was a taboo anyway as you got older in the older years because the the we we wanted to study art in year 12 and we were told we couldn't because you don't know the medium or the material in which you'll get in your paper and it could be a nude. So I mean, for heaven's sake, don't be worried when I look back now.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1818s)

Yeah, this person talked about how she said the girls had been brainwashed to thinking that they were less than, right? And that is, that is really the misogynistic culture that they have, right, is the women are placed below.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1831s)

And and it is, and every single person that has reached out has said the same thing. The general consensus is the opinion of people is that women are servile in that they are there to serve. They are less than. And it's slowly, if you think about it too, it is, it's seamlessly indoctrinated into that world, into our lives when we were back there because even just down to meeting rooms, the very, the very small sort of barely noticeable um fact [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1861s) mics aren't in where the the rows where the women sit. It's, you know, that power. It's like you you don't get to speak and we're showing you. Like it's those small unnoticeable things that, you know, take away. By the time you realize it, well, you already have accepted it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1879s)

Mm hmm. Yeah. So we, another thing that this, that we've had brought through multiple teachers and this principal was we talk often about the disappearing of teachers and the disappearing of people that just all of a sudden are just gone there. You know, one day they're there and the next day they're gone. And so we'd asked her, like, on average, what would it be? And it was, she had said, on average, five per month that would disappear, which is crazy.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1909s)

Students or teachers?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1910s)

Teachers.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1911s)

Teachers.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1912s)

Yeah. So it would be let go if, so kids would often complain, right, to their parents and then those parents would come back. This is the problem we get to when we have such a tight knit society inside a school is because a lot of these CAs have kids in that school. A lot of these people, right, they're all intertwined. So it's not like going to a public school and everything's kept separate. In here, everything's together. And so she said, you know, like you, you did not complain [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1942s) a CA's child, you just didn't. No matter what that child did, that child got away with it, right? And if you did, you, she called it, you were disappeared overnight, right?

 Um, but um, another good point that she had had mentioned was the accreditation that people don't have to do. I mean, this principal didn't have any, she had, she did not have an admin degree. She wasn't, she didn't have the requirements to be a principal. I mean, she said she was good at it and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1972s) totally believe she was. But I mean, there was somebody else that she had mentioned that had worked there, didn't even have a college degree, had been there for five years teaching.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=1980s)

A special ed teacher. A special ed teacher. Special ed teachers, you think that would be a special ed, you'd have to get special education, special credit, special teaching to deal with those kinds of kids because they have learning disabilities, they have behavior disabilities, they have developmental disabilities. I mean, that usually requires at least a college degree and this person didn't even have a college degree.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2008s)

And the reason they think that this is okay is because they teach globally, right? So they they they have this belief that, you know, if you're not accredited in that, in that state or in that province or wherever they are, it doesn't matter because you're teaching globally. But I mean, teachers should at least have their degree, right? Like it's just, it's, I mean, again, I ask you, is this really the school you want your child in?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2034s)

And I think, I think that too would be hard because like teachers, like I've had other people message me and say they found out, they Googled, they found out what school they were or they've watched a TikTok. And one lady recently, she said;

"Thank you, you saved me from a horrendous job."

 Like I was teaching at one of these schools and when I grew, when when I was in year seven, I think we counted like 13 or 14 teachers we went through that year. Like our school in particular, the older kids were like, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2064s) were a bad school. Like it was, some of the stories that those teachers could come forward with are just next level. And and that's the thing, that the problem is you you're creating a society where it's enabled. It's not frowned upon, it's not stopped because you see those same kids at church. It's the same groups, it's the same bullies, it's the same um toxic behavior that continues.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2092s)

Yeah, I agree. You're creating a whole generation of kids that have no discipline. They've never been made to mind. If your teacher is a woman and you're a boy, you don't have to listen to her because she's a woman. You know, if your teacher complains about you, well, we as parents will go in and get rid of her. We'll just disappear her. And there's no accountability. What does that teach a child?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2115s)

Yeah. And I mean, their excuse that they would say to the other teachers when they would ask is that their excuse always was, well, they moved on, which any teacher knows, you don't move on to another job halfway through the year, right? Or a third way of the year or quarter way of the year. You don't, a teacher signs up for the whole, the whole year. You can't have that many people, that many teachers disappearing and being told, oh, they've moved on. You know, that that's not true, not true. Another thing that she talked [about in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2145s) the school was, we're going go into, is the alcohol, right? So um alcohol and water bottles like...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiwXkuU4d9uU%26t%3D2157s)

...seventh and eighth grade.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2161s)

...students, seventh and eighth grade, alcohol in water bottles.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2165s)

And that's that has been like every second message has been, not just from people that have teachers, but like you saw the one that we shared today where she was concerned about the level of how young they were drinking alcohol. But you've got to realize that alcohol has been, was part of our growing up from the very onset. From the very moment you can sit upright in the Lord's supper meeting, they are dipping your dummy or shoving the the supper cup [full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2195s) of alcohol into your mouth. It's seamlessly integrated into your life. You think it's a normal part of life. And then on top of that, you've got a very misogynistic, in my opinion, approach to it where a man goes, it makes a strong man stronger and a weak man weaker. So of course, it's like the story of the emperor's new clothes. You don't want to be seen not not being the strong man. So you assume that you are and therefore that gives you the necessary approval to drink that [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2225s) or to to abuse alcohol. 

And it's not just men. Like I know there are women in that separate, but then it leads to things like there was a gentleman that lived down the road from me that committed suicide because he battled with alcohol and they don't seek professional help. They don't, and as much as they say they do, not professional help from Brethren members. We're talking proper help and proper facilities, not just a old-fashioned doctor that you've been friends with forever that has techniques that they used in the early 16th century to cure somebody from alcohol because it's more than that. It's the high pressure society that you're creating that leads people to drink. They need the advice to...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2272s)

...cope. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2275s)

Another teacher that said about the water, alcohol in the water bottles, and she said it was so strong that when the regional director came around, she took him down there. She said;

 "I've got this problem. I do not know what to do to deal with it. If I go to a CA, they'll disappear me. I want somebody to back me up." 

So they went down to the area where the backpacks are kept and the kids were outside and they proceeded to open a couple of water bottles and smell it. And lo and behold, one of the students walked by and the next thing they heard, they were being accused by the students, this is a high up teacher and a regional director, they were being accused of licking and drinking out of the water bottles. Um, so no accountability [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2324s) all. Like no respect for the position of a regional director or a teacher. Um, just, what are you doing drinking out of my water bottle? Like back in my days, I mean, I would have assumed we would have got suspended immediately for even thinking of bringing alcohol in the school, let alone, you know, putting it in your water bottle and bringing it to school.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2345s)

Yeah, but for them to do that would be for them to acknowledge that there is a problem and then they'd have to acknowledge from where that problem stems and that would be themselves. So of course they're not going to, much accountability for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2357s)

Yeah, I asked an insider here the other day, I said, "If there was one thing you would want seen changed in there, what would it be?" And this insider says, "Separation bullshit gone and the corruption." And then the next answer was, "They need a dry out center for a lot of these drunks as well." Yeah, which is it, the alcohol is such a horrible, horrible problem in there. It's such a problem in there.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2386s)

And the sad thing is they use, they use scripture to back it up and therefore it's okay. Like it's every second scripture is a, you know, that backs up their claims to drinking alcohol or the leader does it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2401s)

And I think, yeah, I think the biggest thing that the issue that they have in these schools and what every teacher, everybody's come across on all of our in our inboxes is that they can't, they have no power to come in and say what needs to be changed. And even when that does happen, so you know, that this principal, they did, they, the big guys came down to to this to this specific school and asked these teachers what they wanted, right? And so I, she got, you know, the courage up to say, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2431s) like there's too much change, there's no warning, there's no notice, there's always, there's always something changing. And they came back and said that it makes you a better educator, right? Like it's...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2442s)

So the thing is is there's just the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2443s)

I agree. So they do have these bullying, and we had asked her to about these bully, the bullying program that was just newly implemented. Right. And it really was just a checklist. It was like, here we watch this video. Now let's make a checklist of it. It was not implemented the way that a school should have an anti-bullying program implemented. Right. And I figured that that's probably what would have happened when I heard that this anti-bullying program was being implemented, that it probably was just some simple thing that they could show that, hey, yes, we're doing this. And which is, it's sad. It's so sad for those people that are so horribly, horribly bullied, right? She said that there was kids that were making sexual comments to the teachers, kids that were bullying and saying, my dad's the boss of your dad, right? Like it's, it's so systemic and it comes from so many avenues that for them just to pull out a video and be like, I'm going to play this video for, you know, and to say that I've implemented an anti-bullying program, it's [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2505s) going to be enough. It's just not going to be enough.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2507s)

No, exactly. It's a band-aid where the issue is the wound, right? The toxic behavior they enable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2515s)

Yeah. And...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2516s)

It's the same with like moving kids around. Like I remember at school, my cousin was shifted to that school, taken off his family. I know of another girl that was shifted to the school because of the alleged, you know, abuses of her sisters. And there's just, there was so many different like changes with kids and then with teachers. It didn't provide a stable environment for [learning,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2546s) which is what ultimately or their reasoning for having these schools or protection. Like where was the protection when I was sexually assaulted at that school? There is no protection there at all.

 I was bullied horrifically to the point of I wanted to commit suicide. There is no protection. These schools do not offer protection. They harbor and enable bullies and that just continues from generation to generation. This is not a school you'd want to send your kids to. And they try and give you examples of public schools and how terrible it [was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2576s) No, I know people that go to public schools and have been, and their kids go to public schools. They never have this issue. And if they do, it's reported correctly, not to a community member who deals with it how they see fit, with people that have actual specific trainings or accolades to deal with this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2593s)

Yeah. And you know, one of the things that she really pointed out was that even the CAs, so when you even go to report something of this, there's one of two scenarios where it's a CA that has a lot of power and knows it doesn't have to do anything about it. Or it's a CA that has no power and has no clout. Right. So she says it's very set up in a way that when you need to report anything about abuse, there is really, it either doesn't go anywhere because this person doesn't know that he doesn't need to set it anywhere, or this person doesn't have enough power to do anything. It's [somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2623s) who's as meek and mild at the bottom of the totem pole. He knows that if he goes to somebody with this problem, nothing's going to be done about it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2631s)

This is so representative of the wider community though. Like if you go and report a sexual abuse or assault to my grandma or something, like a family that's lower in their society, yes, that person might be genuinely concerned about what happened. But if somebody higher up, so an example, one of the Hales family allegedly assaulted a man who I have heard this [story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2661s) So it's an opinion or alleged story. Assaulted this man by grabbing him in the balls and someone very close to Bruce Hales. And that person reported it. And because it was, you know, of the Hales family, they were just told it's been dealt with. You need to forgive. Like that person genuinely had a concern. Like it really affects your overall placing of [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2691s) you thought this wholesome Christian group is. Like you have these people on pedestals, right? In particular, Bruce Hales or the Hales family. 

And so when at all any of that psyche is interrupted, it can really affect you mentally. For example, when you're abused. So when this person was assaulted, as a result, that person has battled with alcohol to date because they've never, it's never like, it's uninterrupted that balance. And this is the problem when you're not exposed to the wider community, when [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2722s) not even given awareness about um abuses or the fact that there could be abusers and it's all hidden for protection. You can really affect somebody's mental health when they are brutally exposed to it because they're so naive or so innocent and that contrast is really what affects people mentally and and scars them for life.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2741s)

And I think the other thing too is that I mean they shouldn't have alleged pedophiles going into these schools or being at school functions and that's happening. That's happening where, you know, they shouldn't like that, that should just not be a situation if you're really going to take care of a situation, especially situations that haven't been dealt with. Yeah, those kinds of things just shouldn't happen, right? If you were truly a Christian community and there for the welfare of your next generation, those things, you don't cure a pedophile overnight. You don't cure a pedophile by sitting them in a room full of priests and being like, so you did this, this, this, and this. And the person says, oh yes, I did that. And then, and then it's all forgiven. And then those people that were affected by that pedophile now have to say that they forgive him too. And he gets off scot-free and turns around and another [generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2794s) gets affected. That's why it's so systemic is because they don't stop the problem. They don't heal the problem.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2802s)

And they don't talk about it. They need to speak about these things because like my family, when my sister was groomed, my parents don't understand that. They can't see it. They're like, no, the Lord knows. I'm like, of course he does, if that's what you want to believe, but it doesn't stop it. You need to stop these people from being in situations where they can groom children and therefore abuse them. And this is the problem. You're saying that it doesn't stop. It doesn't, no, that's right. It doesn't. It enables it. 

And you're, if you, if you [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2832s) of somebody being abused or you're an abuser by proxy because you're enabling it, like you aren't stopping it. And this is why we're bringing this to attention, particularly to people inside. You need to realize what you are raising your children in and what schools you're bringing them up in and your family and friends. You can't trust everybody. And yes, you can say that you can't trust everybody out here, but we have a choice out here. We don't get a list with who we have to have for lunch on Sunday. We don't have restrictions about where or where we can't work. We don't have [restrictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2862s) about where we can or can't send our kids to school. We make that choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2865s)

Yeah, and I think this kind of leads us into the the people that are associated. So we know the Brethren stand by the whole scripture of withdrawing from iniquity, right? And then we have someone, and if anybody's following Facebook on our Exclusive Brethren pages there, you there's been conversation about Massimo Introvigne in there. Massimo Introvigne, I don't know how you say his last name, but I just call him Massimo Introvigne. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2894s)

Give us a background. I don't I don't know who he is, so explain who this is?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2895s)

Massimo Introvigne is a scholar of Satanism. So, and he's also, um, he does literally...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2904s)

...known as that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2905s)

Yes. So yes, he's known as that. He's known also as a cult apologist. So when you, if you research him, he's, I mean, there's tons of things. So I'm going to just share a screen here on, I'm going to start with with the books that he's written. Um, let me just get it up here first.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2935s)

So the reason that we're bringing his name up or the reason that we're drawing attention to him is because there's actual pictures of him being in the school and which alarm every parent.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2950s)

Yeah, so we're going to, I know, I'm going to get to those pictures, but I want to lead up to it. So here's, here is a list of books that he has, um, he has written. So I'm not going to go through all of them. It's a lot of magical stuff, um, a lot of Satanism, um, pedophilia. He's done one on the Plymouth Brethren, Sacred...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2972s)

...Eroticism.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2975s)

Go ahead.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2978s)

Sorry, I was going to say his latest book, I just Googled while you're doing it, is The Sacred Eroticism, Tantra and Sexuality in Movement for Spiritual Integration. So this person, Massimo Introvigne, they've had at their school, what, giving speeches or...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=2998s)

Um, I I'm actually not sure what he's been doing at the school, but there's pictures with him inside the school and outside of the school. And if I was a parent with a child going to one of these OneSchool Global schools, I would be taking my child out of there ASAP. No way would I allow my child to be around anybody who either teaches about this, practices this, um, writes books about this. I don't care what he's doing. No way would I have a child around [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3029s) And that is from my own personal experience. I'm not going to go into those personal experiences, but all I can say is that I haven't revealed everything that's happened to me in where Alan took me to. And all I can say is that having pictures of Massimo Introvigne in an OSG school, yeah, I reported it to the police. I gave all this information to the police to help him with my case. So all I can say is that I would not trust what he is doing in a school. I just wouldn't. And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3062s) you go through all of these, I'm not going to go through this. You guys can read, I'm sorry for the listeners. Just Google Massimo Introvigne and it'll show all his books. But it's, there's The Return of Magic.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3074s)

The Church of Scientology, he's written a book on the Plymouth Brethren. So do they approve?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3079s)

So, um, well he's, I mean, in the book, I haven't, I have not read through the whole entire book, but in the book, he is pro-Plymouth Brethren, right? He is trying to make them look good, right? But I mean, we're talking about “Witchcraft, Evil, and the  Memnoch of the devil.”  Like he's, it's all, it's very...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3098s)

It's very, so reading down this, reading down this list of titles, the hypocrisy just kind of hit me. The teachers talk about the chapters that get ripped out of the school books at the school, the chapters that get ripped out because they won't allow them to be taught or the things. Every single book on this list would be banned from the Plymouth Brethren library. And yet this is what they're allowing [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3128s) tell their story. That just seems like the hypocrisy is…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3133s)

And they're letting him in the school. Like you're in the school. And not only that, not even only in the school was he here. This is from, this is from Massimo's um website himself. Here is the picture;

“ Here is this picture I took in the Pennsylvania home of a member of Brethren.”

For that's kind of what we were, Exclusive Brethren were called, shows a genealogy from Darby. And I mean, he actually doesn't even have it right on here. He's got John Stephen Hales serving from 1922 to 2002\. He's got Harvey [Symington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3163s) spelled wrong, and it should be James Symington. But still, he was in some Brethren's home and got to take a picture of this. Yet, could you imagine if we were, if we just showed up out of the blue to our parents' house after being called an apostate or writing the stuff that we're writing about or talking about what we're talking about? There's no way we'd be let in. But yet they let in this person who investigates and researches and there's pictures of him with like in Transylvania [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3198s) Dracula paraphernalia.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3201s)

I'm reading he's like the president of some Dracula group.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3205s)

Yeah, like it's just, it's absolutely crazy, absolutely crazy. Um, so I guess my my whole concern when I saw, I'm not gonna, it took me a bit to recover from seeing what I saw because it jolted me in a way that I was like, there's, here's this man inside a school where there's small children and like with no protection. I don't know, for me, if it was me in there with, I would [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3235s) showing up at the school the next day and I'd be like, I refuse to have anything to do with you. You are not allowed to have my child until this is cleaned up. That's how I would put it. Um, I'm going to share a little bit of a video. So this is one of his teachings that he does. Um, and they actually talk about his book that he wrote in this. Let's have to wait for this thing to go up here. My top thing won't go up. I can't get to my tab. There we go. Oh, this is another one of his, this is a whole thing that he did, but here's, I'm just going to play this for you. Can you guys see this?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3279s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3281s)

Okay. So here he is. He's giving a lecture or he's teaching somewhere and I just want you guys to listen to this for a few minutes;

 "Greetings, my name is Catherine Terres and it is my great honor to introduce my colleague and friend, our second keynote speaker. Massimo's list of accomplishments is far too long to even begin to make dent in here. So, suffice to say that he has published more than 80 academic books, and I have not yet found a bad one. His most recent is on the Plymouth Brethren. That's the first monograph on this group. It's a small conservative evangelical group about which he's told me there's nothing in covering this conference except for the fact that Aleister Crowley's father was a member. And I'm pleased to be able to tell you that because in a rare moment of a bad decision, Oxford University Press decided to [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3363s) that part out. So you'll only hear it here. So Massimo is currently the director of CESNUR, the Center for the Study of New Religious, er, Religions, and he was the founder in 1988, so that has been a colossal undertaking."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3391s)

That picture you showed and the sacred, what was it called, I can't remember now, um, yeah, literally looks like a glorified spiritual version of an orgy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3406s)

100%, like that's what I'm seeing is this is just crazy. Like how, I just don't grasp the concept of how the, how we come to terms with like allowing a man like this. And so I've got more pictures, obviously. I'm going to take this a little bit further. So I want to go back to Aleister Crowley quick. So Aleister Crowley is um someone who's very much in the occult um sector of religion, right? So he's he's known [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3436s) be a part of that kind of a group. And it was Aleister Crowley's father who was a member of the PBCC or Exclusive Brethren or whatever they were back then. So I want to share you some, I'm going to show you some pictures here as we go through this. Um, can you see that?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3456s)

In a Brethren school.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3458s)

Yeah, so here's Massimo Introvigne in a OneSchool Global classroom. Here he is outside the OneSchool campus in Sweden.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3469s)

Wait, where's he from? So did he do some sort of tour of all the Brethren schools?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3474s)

I'm not sure. This is from, these are all from his, um, it was one of his, it was from his website. And we've just added little labels on there of saying what it is. Um, and then this is him again with the principal of the OneSchool Global New York campus. Here he is in lecturing an audience of Satanists about Satanism.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3500s)

So like, I wonder, was he teaching that at the Brethren schools?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3504s)

I have no idea. You can only imagine what, I have no idea. Like we, I don't know what went on with him inside those schools. But I, what I want to relate and have the parents from OneSchool Global understand is I want you to understand who this man is, what he represents, what he teaches, what he stands for, what he is involved in, and he was inside your school. And if I was comfortable enough telling what went on with me in a place that Alan took me to, you would pick your children up and you would leave the PBCC tomorrow. I guarantee it. So here we are. So I just want to blow this up a little bit. And yes, this is a little bit of vulgar. But I just want to show you. Here's a clip from something that he was teaching on.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3558s)

We need to produce high… But is that children?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3561s)

It looks like it, doesn't it?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3562s)

They look like children. Oh my God. I mean, they look like children to me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3569s)

Yeah. And they just, I mean, he just, he should not be in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church schools or anywhere around there. I don't care if he wrote a book about them or they think that he is there and he helps, you know, clean up their image a bit. What this man teaches should be nowhere near what they believe. It's complete and utter hypocrisy. You talk about being an apostate [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3599s) being an opposer. You literally are opposing your own faith.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3604s)

But it's, yeah, and I guess the point here is the hypocrisy of all of this. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3610s)

So again, here he is teaching about Crowley. So this will be Aleister Crowley.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3616s)

Sex magic techniques. Wow. I mean, I'm not going to yuck someone's yums, but teaching it, I'd be interested to know what he was teaching in a children's school, in a Brethren school. Why?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3627s)

Why was he in there? Why was he, why was he in the school?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3630s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3632s)

I guarantee you Ben and Carman, if we were to show up at a OSG school tomorrow, do you think they would let us in?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3638s)

Not at all. No. I could do, would they let me come to schools and do teaching on, you know, finding, being okay with your sexuality and actually giving a proper like conversation, having a proper conversation that they should be having with kids and or with the teenagers at schools saying that, you know, like rather than our sex education at school was literally so not, not, it's not a sex education. We did not know [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3668s) about protection or anything, which is, you know, from what I've heard, you are taught in normal schools.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3674s)

So I mean it's just, it is, it is the complete and utter hypocrisy. But for me, it, my alarm bells were just ringing right off of like, I am just, you be careful. That's  my message from my personal experiences and what I've been through is be careful. Be careful with your children. You need to make sure where your children are and what um your children are being introduced to. It is far more evil than what you [find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3704s) out here. Having somebody like that at a school, you will not find that out here in public schools or in Catholic schools. That is...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3714s)

...you just won't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3715s)

What you guys are introducing your children to in there is utter evilness. It's just absolutely...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3723s)

So I'd be, yeah, I'd be asking questions. Don't take it from our word, but ask questions literally.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3730s)

Go Google him. Go to a public library, read up his whole Wikipedia, go to his website. Um, we, there's, we need, I mean, we could do a whole podcast just on him and what he, what he's done and who he is really. So we're just giving you a little tip of the iceberg, but what I would suggest to you is go to a library and go and do your own research. Go research him. Watch his videos of what he teaches to other people.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3757s)

And it's not to say, it's not to defame him by any means. No, not at all. Showing people, this is what this man is. And this is what you're allowing in your school. But most often when they write a book on your religion, it's financed or partially financed or information is either given or not given about your religion if you participated in that book in any way. Knowing what he, what other books he's written, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3787s) mean, it's just got question marks written all over it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3789s)

I mean he's written a book about the Mormons, um, Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientology, right? So he is known as a cult apologist. And I don't have an issue, I don't care, I don't have an issue with what Massimo Introvigne does. I have an issue with what he does and who he is being inside a mainstream Christian church saying, and then treating us the way that they treat us and not following up when they should be following up on certain [things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3820s) It's just the hypocrisy of it and the safety of the children that would concern me from my own personal experiences. So we're just going to, we're going to slide over to our next thing. So our next subject, go ahead.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3837s)

I was going to say, just looking at his books, it's really interesting that in 2018, he wrote the Plymouth Brethren book. I was wondering if he had been going around to schools as a welcoming, you know, they brought him in to have a look at the society so he could write this book based on, you know, what they show him, but it doesn't, because she was saying it's his latest book. His latest book is Sacred Eroticism, so it's about tantra and sexuality. So it's not, yeah, and that video...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3860s)

...was from, that video was from from quite a few years back, right? Like it's not, it might have been that's...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3866s)

...what he's doing, but yeah, interesting. I, but it's the point too that it's the hypocrisy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3872s)

Yeah, completely. It's totally, it's the hypocrisy that they are not, they are not who they say they are, right? Your your actions do not align with your words. Your actions do not align with um the spokesperson's comments to certain journalists and reporters when you get them to. They don't align. You're not a line. The beliefs are not aligning with what you're showing everybody else.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3897s)

No, there's no separation from evil. You brought, you brought, you didn't separate from it. You brought it in.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3904s)

Well, we've seen that purely too with people that are convicted pedophiles or rapists that are alleged and are just allowed to live mainstream within the, within the religion still. And people just have to accept that, well, the Lord has forgiven his sins, so you have to as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3921s)

Yeah, and I mean even just going back to what their actions not lining up. You think of the the spokesperson um on the one article that was written about you Ben, the big long rebuttal that they gave back. Um, I don't know if you have that.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3937s)

I haven't shared that, but I've got a full copy. The journalist gave me a full copy of their rebuttal. And yeah, it's just the issue that they kept focusing on was that they are not a cult. They didn't even address the fact that they're homophobic because they know they are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3952s)

Yeah. So our next thing that we want to talk about today is has to do with the car crash that happened in Australia and how the PBCC reported it in their Frank News. So we know that we had news coverage over it and then Frank News reported it inside there. And we just want to show you the difference so that you're caught up to speed and you get the full story. So I'm going to...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3984s)

And for the outsiders listening, Frank News is the Brethren's version of the world's events filtered, basically, like communist news to show you what's happening outside, but what they want you to know. And here's an example.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=3999s)

Okay, so first of all, this is the, actually Carman, I'm going to let you take this over because you really know about this.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4008s)

And well, just the one on the left hand side is that the story that Frank News modeled their story after. Now one thing that we found out after we we pulled this off and we were really alarmed about the editing of the news. Frank News is a subscription news service that the Plymouth Brethren members can apply for and pay for. It comes with a price. You have to pay for it. And they supply you with your morning news or your noontime news or your evening news. And but what they're doing is they're taking the AAP news and then they're editing it to fit their own needs, I would I would assume. And at first we were a little concerned, like, why would you edit somebody's news? But what we've been told is they must have a subscription to the AAP. So therefore, they can take it and change the picture and change the news and change the order of stuff legally without getting into trouble. So we did figure that out. 

But this particular news story, it came out after that accident in Wangaratta. And the only reason it was brought to our attention was because the real news story was posted on the ex-Brethren Facebook site. And then when the Frank News came out, the kind insider that brought it to our attention printed off the Frank News version and set it beside the one that was posted on Facebook and went, wait, this tells a completely different story. And when you set the two of them side by side, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4120s) you'll figure out is there's a number of um lines in the news article that have been removed. Yes, and it's a completely different story when you start removing certain details from a news story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4139s)

Okay, so and and and to make things, we wanted to say about this, where they got, that they got this picture from another article and then just zoomed in. So I mean, yes, they might have permission to do this, but we just want to show that how they really are not, I mean, they're they're not...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4157s)

...essentially, essentially they're controlling the narrative. They're telling you exactly, exactly what they want you to know. And have you got the next part?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4168s)

And here's, okay, so just hang on a second. Okay, here's the real news article and this is what they presented. So um Carman, I, you got a version that you can read because I can't read that tiny, so I'll let you read what the difference was.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4186s)

If you notice on the one on the left hand side, there's a number of things that have been highlighted in yellow marker. The ones in the yellow marker have been completely removed, removed from the Frank News article. And you say, well, they probably did that to keep it shorter or whatever excuse might come out. But what we actually noticed is when you zone in on the things that have been removed, the accident in Wangaratta, as we know, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4217s) was alcohol as a factor. And the driver was kept under police guard from the moment that the accident happened until his court case the next day and he was let go. But what's been conveniently left out of the Brethren version is a statement that says, "A driver under police guard is in the hospital and will face court." Nowhere in the Frank News version is that statement. It has been removed. The second one that has been removed that's very important to the Wangaratta accident situation is, "He has been charged with culpable driving, causing death, dangerous driving, causing death and negligent driving causing serious injury and also issued a notice of immediate driving [ban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4275s)."

Makes you wonder, right? What do you accomplish by taking out the actual reason for the accident?

And then if you look over, there is this talking about the same accident? They've said a 26-year-old woman has been charged. So that they've cleverly, creatively edited the article to make it sound like the woman, of course it was a woman, was responsible when in fact it was the guy that was drinking, the Brethren guy that was drinking and driving recklessly and [charged.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4317s) 

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4318s)

Yeah. So what they do, by taking those two very important statements out, okay, the ones that put the Brethren driver as responsible, by taking those two out, you shoot up that line about a 26-year-old woman who was charged with causing death or dangerous driving after her car collided with a white MG. It makes the story appear as though it was that woman's fault. And it was just by clever editing, remove those two statements [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4349s) it was just cleverly controlled the narrative and changed the whole story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4353s)

These are actually all the accidents that happened that weekend and what, when you, it was the insiders when they got this, they were like, well, no, it was, it was like, it was a 26-year-old woman's fault. That's literally what they believe. They don't believe that what happened happened. They believe by reading this, that it was a 26-year-old woman who was erratically driving and caused it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4378s)

And this is something you read about in history books, like about Hitler's time and the mixed medias and the clever creative newspapers that he controlled, or in Stalin's era, where there was no murder in Russia because Russia is paradise. This is yet another example of people controlling the narrative to create a different picture without saying it, but alluding to it. 

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4404s)

Yes, exactly. And doing it within the confines of the law, because you subscribe to AAP News, you're legally allowed to do it to control the narrative. It's brainwashing. It's just another form of brainwashing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4420s)

So for us, we just want to point out why going into the OSG, like that OneSchool Global stuff and the talk about the alcohol and the, you know, nobody taking accountability and not teaching accountability, right? Here is another example of where they go in and they do their editing where accountability is not taken, where there is no accountability being shown, right? 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4444s)

Like it's just, we're seeing the results of no accountability from those school, school incidents that have led to an adult making a reckless decision. And then an act that, an alcohol infused accident, like it's, it's, we're seeing the results of no accountability.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4459s)

That's why we wanted to bring this up today. Yeah, exactly. Like this is what happens, right? Like, it's just, and I mean, I feel awful. I mean, I feel awful for this situation because they are, again, it's a product of the environment. It's a product of the teachings. It's the product of the systemic problems that they have in there where nobody takes, nobody's dealing with what needs to be dealt with.

It's just always this constant cover up, cover up, cover up. How do we, how do we cover this up? How do we make it look better? Instead of being like, let's just go in and be like, yes, this person has an alcohol problem. This person's [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4491s) pedophile. This person's doing this. Just go in and look at everything black and white and just deal with the situation. And then all of a sudden, you know, that gives a chance for this cult to become a mainstream Christian church once again.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4505s)

Yeah, yeah. I think it's really important what we've covered today is as, really, don't take our word for, we've shown you examples. Do your own research, question things. And if you need a scripture for it, there's one about, come let us reason together, where Jehovah was like, come let us reason together. Go reason, ask them. It's the safety of your children that at risk here because look what happens when we've seen from the outset of alcohol in schools, teachers complaining, [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4535s) an adult reckless driving and you know, this happens out here, but with that, it's a common denominator in there that there always is and has been the butt of most issues, whether it's abuse or violence or driving or accidents, it always seems to tie back to alcohol. Yeah, there is a toxic culture in the Brethren that needs addressing. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4557s)

They have, I mean, it's like you can, you can bring it down to two, two addictions, right? There's sex addiction and there's alcohol addiction.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4566s)

Let's make it three, and power.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4569s)

And power, 100%. Well, power, power encompasses it all. Yeah, exactly. But you know, I mean like, it is, it is, and I mean, when you put that kind of power on people, those kinds of addictions become rampant.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4583s)

Yeah. And enabled.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4585s)

Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. But anyhow, we wanted to give you all an update and really address what kind of safety and what kind of life you want for your children. And I, my suggestion is go to a library, Google, obviously you're not going to be able to do it off your UBT phones, but go Google, Google, Google this stuff.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4611s)

And if you're not comfortable with that, talk to friends that you trust outside that you you you know, a good neighbor, you know, another good Christian woman down the road, not us. Like ask, you know, ask other people, you know, is this normal? Is this the way my child is being raised? Is this normal? No, it's not. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwXkuU4d9uU&t=4629s)

Exactly. Yeah. Anyhow, all right, okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us and until next time, take care. Much love to you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
