## Summary

This is part 3 of a 3 part series.
Trigger warning! This podcast contains discussion regarding sexual abuse. Viewer discretion is advised.
We merge 2 podcasts together to discuss the hierachy within the PBCC. Abi takes us through an in depth look at how this "mainstream Christian church" runs as a business that seems to only benefit those at the top of this ecosystem. She walks us through a chart that was literally created by the PBCC and through emails that show their true colors. After watching this, it really does confirm, in black and white, where their priorities are. It definitely doesn't seem to be on the welfare of their congregation and teachings of the Bible. Where does this business seem to be heading as a "Mainstream Christian Church?" Hopefully, those inside will see that the love of money is the root of all evil, and the freedom out here doesn't need that kind of wealth to be a heartfelt and compassionate Christian.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts. Leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=73s)

Hello everyone, we are back with Abi for part three and I'm going to just hand the mic right over to Abi and we're going to dive right into this as she goes through another slideshow presentation. Welcome Abi.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=88s)

Hi there, thank you so much. So Cheryl had to leave our last podcast, so I wanted to catch up with her on this part of the podcast and go through some of the points with her so that we also have her opinion which we can add into the main podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=108s)

Yeah, exactly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=109s)

So if I share screen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3D7vFIa7Mic-w%26t%3D112s)

So we're just going to merge two different podcasts together into this one and make it a very full podcast.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=121s)

That's the one because it's important.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=123s)

It is. This is very important stuff.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=125s)

Which bear with me because I've tried to put this as structured as possible. So it's clear for those that haven't had anything to do with the Brethren. I've tried to make it clear so they can get a grasp of this organization. Yeah so I've created this structure and I thought it was really important to create this structure because Brethren don't quite realize what they are part of in my belief.

The whole of the Brethren system is just a big fat juicy business plan and it's really clever how it's been done because everything is made to look like it's for the benefit of the Brethren, but actually in real life it's benefiting one person and one family. And we've touched on it before about how some of the family are buying eight, [nine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=191s) million dollar houses. Where do you get that much free cash from? Well, here it is. We speak about how the Hales are successful businessmen and they're good at business. Well, this is how good they are because they've completely fleeced 50 odd thousand people into their system, which they're now calling an ecosystem for their own benefit. It's just mind-blowing. It's so clever.

So along the top we have, well at the top we have Bruce Hales, [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=235s) whose code name actually in the Brethren is the CEO. So if there's seminars where he may be talking and there's a potential non-Brethren member there, he will be referred to as the CEO. Or amongst children at school if they are talking about Bruce Hales and they want to do it covertly in front of the teachers, they will talk about the CEO. So it's not just a name that I've put there, it's also a code name for what people inside the Brethren think he is to a worldly person, if that makes sense.

So under him we've got his sons and his family's businesses and the profit they're making from that. So he's got that that he can dip into. They've all got successful businesses and they oversee all the other top line. So we've got the profit from UBT, and UBT is the Brethren hub so to speak.

So if I go to the next slide briefly, so it's where Brethren members only buy most of their household services. So you've got your home insurance, your car insurance, you can buy your cars there, you can buy your broadband packages, your travel insurance, your business insurance, trade credit insurance. Now I don't actually know what that is, but anyway, travel insurance. There's a Fuel Our Schools initiative, which I just found out [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=334s) from the rebate they are making seven million. So far they've made seven million pounds just in fuel rebate in that Fuel Our Schools initiative. That's the money.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=349s)

Is that just in the UK?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=351s)

I'm not sure. I presume so, but I'm not sure.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=358s)

So when you're in the Brethren and you're buying these facilities from UBT, which we all need home insurance and car insurance and obviously groceries, do the Brethren believe that going to the shop and buying that is for a good cause? So they will go there because they think if they spend their money there it's going to a good cause rather than spending their money in Tescos or buying independent insurance.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=385s)

Yeah, yeah and there's a certain guilt that comes with that. So people that can't afford to shop at the school shop because the price is so inflated, you know, they feel guilty about that and that's cruel. It's not fair.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=400s)

Yeah, it also takes away somebody's freedom of choice, isn't it? Because the whole cycle of what they've set up there. So they've got these independent schools that Brethren children have to go to, although the Brethren say they don't have to. They choose to go to them. They have to go to. So if you took your child out of school and put them in a mainstream school, that would ridicule you in the eyes of the Brethren, I imagine.

So there's a sort of cycle, ever increasing circle going on here that in order to pay for [them,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=430s) you then have to go shopping for all your goods at this particular shop and all your facilities from this particular company. And you're doing it because you think, but what is the purpose behind the schools? The purpose behind the schools is to keep the children separate, yes. And actually they could just send their children to a mainstream school and educate them to keep themselves out of things that will harm them and not be done with all that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=455s)

Yes, and this is another reason why children get so involved in things that will harm them. Yeah, because they're so sheltered from it that when you start to, you know, look into those kind of things, they go far too deep. I mean, you look at the amount of young Brethren lads that have been convicted of, thankfully convicted, I mean, this is the ones that we know of, that have been convicted of having child abuse and child pornography. Yeah, and images, you know, it's scary. Once you start poking that nest, you know, you're going to get bitten because there's such strict boundaries put down on children, they don't know what the limit is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=503s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=504s)

And that's scary.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=504s)

And they've not been taught, have they? And also thinking back to what you said earlier, Abi, about sexual abuse in a mainstream school, children are taught from a young age, delicately taught about boundaries. Yes. And there's certain parts of your body that you would not expect an adult to touch. Yes. So they kind of grow up with that knowledge that actually if that happens, that's not right and I need to go and tell mummy or daddy. Yes. So none [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=535s) that is taught, is it? No, no.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=537s)

No, I mean, I've taught my child that. Yeah, that's, you know, age appropriately. Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=545s)

Of course, and it's done delicately and sensitively. Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=550s)

And following on from that, sex education as a whole isn't taught either.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=555s)

No, no, no. Well, very limited, very limited. I remember when I was at school, I was like, right, we're talking about this, you know, and with the background of what I went through, I was like, okay, so how does sex actually happen? And they were, and obviously our sex education lessons were supervised by a Brethren woman. We split into boys and girls and then the girls were [supervised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=586s) by a woman, a sister, and the boys were supervised by a brother whilst the science teacher taught it.

And I was like, okay, so how does it actually happen? And this sister from the corner, "So don't worry, Abi, you'll learn about the birds and the bees when you need to." And I was like, Oh my days. What is wrong with these people?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=613s)

Just sums up really, doesn't it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=616s)

And then you've got your broadband and phone packages. And by phone packages, the prices are just extortionate. Like I didn't have a UBT phone for about the last six years when I was in there. I think it was. I don't think I even had a UBT phone when I got married. Yeah, so maybe seven years even.

But I pay £25.99 a month for unlimited text, unlimited data and unlimited calls. My husband, he had a UBT phone for quite a while because he was like, well, we might as well, we don't give in any other ways, let's pay for our phone bills through them. That was back in his brainwashed days. And you know, he'd get a phone bill through and it was, you know, it's £300, £400 a [month?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=672s) A month. Sure.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=676s)

I know on my UBT phone I used to pay about, I think it was £30 a month and you've got about a thousand minutes of talk time.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=686s)

I'm guessing that was pre-data times.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=689s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=691s)

But £30 for a thousand minutes of talk, even that's ludicrous.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=697s)

It's ludicrous.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=698s)

You were paying for that, you had a separate charge for the handset as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=703s)

Yeah, but you paid for the handset, for the data, for the minutes.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=704s)

I think, yeah, I mean when I left, okay, I'm a little bit out of date, but I think the most you could get at the time was like 500 megabytes of data. When you look at it now and you can get unlimited data, it's just, and the amount you were paying for it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=731s)

And also you've got the Streamline 3 software on. So that's how they justify the high prices, that you've got the protection on there. And we're keeping you safe. So the internet is restricted. So you can't get on websites that you would on a non-UBT phone, slash laptop, slash tablet, whatever. It's just completely ridiculous.

Yeah. When me and Bruce were in a relationship like way back, as in before we were married, when I was living in Leamington, I racked up about a two grand bill on a UBT phone.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=775s)

Oh, gosh.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=776s)

Just from talking to Bruce. And thankfully, I didn't pay it. Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=781s)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=783s)

That was the, that was probably one of the only positives about living at a rich person's house. However, I was brought through like a wad of paper and asked to name every single number that was on there. The numbers that I'd called. Yeah. It was all about control. Yeah.

And messages, every message with a UBT phone will go through their server so every message can be tracked, every call can be tracked. And you know, people say that's rubbish. No, I got those pieces of paper handed to me in a folder with every number I'd called, every number I'd texted. So it is true. So those that are in that are wanting to leave, please get a non-UBT phone because you will be being tracked.

I mean, even the children's laptops at school, they put software on them where it takes a screenshot every so many seconds so that what the children are doing at school is monitored throughout the day. And then some form of data recap kind of thing is sent to the parents for the parents to check through. You know, they haven't even got, they're clamping down so much on freedom. And again, this is [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=877s) kids are getting involved in things that even non-Brethren kids would never even dream of.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=886s)

Yeah, because everything's forbidden.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=888s)

Yeah. And is it right also, Abi, that the Streamline 3 tracks everything you're doing as well?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=896s)

Yes. So they've got two options on the Streamline 3\. Oh, thanks, Jackie. They've got two options on the Streamline 3\. I'm going like this because I can visualise it. I've got visual memory and they've got Streamline 3 and then they've got something else underneath which like opens the computer up a little bit more. You have to have a username and a password. Okay, and safe search. Oh, I remember that.

Yeah, so that opens the computer a little bit more and then the person whose name that is, so it'll be like, I don't know, bob.whatever, and then it'll be your password. The person whose name that is, then they have access on a system where you can actually input safe websites yourself, within reason obviously, because it's still being monitored by UBT and the Streamline 3 software. So you've got the two options of how open you want the internet to be.

When I was in the Brethren, the safe search, you could get onto YouTube. Hence these podcasts going onto YouTube is amazing. You know, most Brethren now have access to YouTube. Hence the kids, they know what Peppa Pig is and they know what blinking Paw Patrol is because they watch videos, which is different to years and years ago where you know, you wouldn't.

It's really confusing as well because John Hales said that he would [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=999s) have a mobile phone and then you know, the Lord has turned a corner and everyone's got a phone, everyone's got a laptop, everyone's got a computer. And now we've got like these big screens in our, I'm still saying our houses and still associating myself with them. Yeah. But, you know, it's not been long. Most people have got a screen, you know, this sort of size in their house. And we had a supper in that lounge with that screen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1031s)

Yeah. Yeah. But is that so the Zoom meetings can be enjoyed? Is that kind of all the big screens on? Yeah. I remember, I'm going back a long time now, probably 10 years or more, talking to a teacher in a mainstream school and she had young Brethren children in her school and sort of when OneSchool Global was just secondary school age. And she remembers a father of one of these children, and I know him because he was in our meeting, coming in and vehemently [explaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1062s) why his child must not touch the computer in the classroom.

This would have been, you know, sort of early 90s probably. And she said he was absolutely vehement, you know, so they had to obviously exempt all the children from anything with technology or anything like that. So there's been a few corners turned, hasn't there? There has. Yeah, must be dizzy, man.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1085s)

Yeah, absolutely. In the late 80s, I was in primary school, yeah, like in the junior school, and they had a computer class. I literally had to stand up and say, "I can't touch that because I love the Lord Jesus." I felt so, I felt such a fool.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1104s)

Oh yeah, then that's when the bullying starts.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1109s)

Yes, you've singled yourself out. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, very brave to stand up and say that, I think, Ross. I'd never do that. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1118s)

I remember.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1120s)

Sorry, go on. I remember at school, I was a little sneak. This is primary school, and they were watching a film called Over the Hedge and I told my mum, you know, it's about hedges, it's educational. And we were allowed to watch educational videos, so I was like, yes, fine. And then the teacher caught me watching it and she took me out because obviously my parents had said no.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1155s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1158s)

I remember.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1159s)

Not to watch videos. Yeah, yeah, well okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1165s)

If I go back to the other slide.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1171s)

Yes, here. Then you've got the school shop. So you've got the profits from the school shop and this predominantly, well how they say it is, this goes towards the running of the schools. I remember watching a video on Campus\&Co and there's two children at a blackboard and one of the children has written 'Our School Shop' and then an adult has done an arrow up to the OneSchool Global [badge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1201s). So they're indoctrinating the children from young that the school shops are for the schools.

And a lot of the school shop staff is volunteer work. And a lot of, well I don't know if any of them were paid to be honest, any of the people. I've never heard of anyone being paid for anything they do in the school shop. So the general running is all done by volunteer Brethren housewives. So this is a way of keeping the wives a bit happier and feeling like there's some use other than just cleaning toilets and kitchens and bedrooms and washing, etc.

They've got an incentive to not get disgruntled about life in the Brethren because Bruce Hales used to say that he knew how hard, I forget the word he used, something like mundane, being a Brethren housewife is. And I was like, yeah, so this has been introduced to keep them happy. So that's that sector quiet. The purchasing teams, they're not paid. And the marketing, you're either, there's WhatsApp groups for the school shop on which marketing is sent out. You also have emails sent out almost daily. You've got webinars where every school [shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1291s) will come together as a whole and have a webinar about Campus\&Co.

And then what else have I put? Oh yes, the fundraiser events. So these raise thousands of pounds, or the profit is thousands of pounds rather than raising. Well, I suppose it is fundraiser, isn't it? So yeah, they are raising thousands of pounds per event and they'll cook breakfast, they'll have extra activities for children, they'll do this, they'll do that, all at the same time of creating extra revenue for the school shop.

They just, I say just, beginning of COVID, they set up an online gifting portal so you could send gifts to any locality, any household in the world, in the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1340s) world obviously. And this could be flowers, meal kits, vouchers, you name it, they'd thought of it. And that was another thing that kept it going throughout COVID when we couldn't actually visit the shops.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1355s)

Then we've got the donation based wealth.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1358s)

So this is where it's a bit difficult to explain because there's so many different sectors, but you've got the Grace Trust, you've got the Endowment Fund, which is also known as Vision Welfare inside the Brethren. So for those that are struggling, or for those that are less wealthy than the rest of them, they've got to keep up the Brethren lifestyle. They can dip into the endowment fund.

And Brethren are aware that the endowment fund also has been set up to have as a backup in the [event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1406s) that the whole world crashes. So mortgages will be paid off, loans will be paid off, all from this endowment fund. And to put it into perspective, there was a seminar beginning of the, end of last year, beginning of this year, I forget which, I think it was the end of last year, where they raised half a billion pounds within a week.

That's the kind of money that is, it's free cash. And they're so sucked in by the system that they're putting it straight into this endowment fund. And then after that, two of Bruce Hales's children bought 9 million, 8 [million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1449s) Australian dollar houses.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1454s)

Cash.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1456s)

Cash. Yeah. And for me, I can't compute that people are that thick to not put two and two together. But Brethren are so naive, they wouldn't even think that. And I think that's really sad.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1472s)

And you were still in there when that all went down. Like, were you able to see through that when they were purchasing these houses that like, wow, what? Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1481s)

And a lot of people did, to be honest, but they're too scared to do anything about it because they've got their whole livelihood at risk. You know, this is called the Brethren ecosystem and I'll just refer to one of the other slides. So the goal is to become a self-sustaining community and this is, they've put this is everyone's goal. So if you're in there and you're part of this ecosystem and then you question it and the threat is there to be kicked out, that is your world, that is your ecosystem.

So to people inside, that's really freaking scary because it's put into you that you're going to fail, you're going to die, you're going to do this, you're going to do that. So for the risk [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1532s) the risk of questioning to then be kicked out, it's not worth it for some people. For us, absolutely, because we want to live the life of honesty, integrity and I don't want to rely on anyone. I never have. I've always done, I'm a survivor. I do most things myself. Obviously there's some things that you need help with.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1555s)

And you know, it's quite interesting that they use the word ecosystem, because when you think of an ecosystem, right, an ecosystem holds itself together by multiple pieces. And if you start taking out of these pieces, the ecosystem no longer can thrive. And like in an ecosystem, I mean, there's, in this ecosystem, there's hierarchy, right? There's the top and then there's the bottom feeders, right?

If there is enough of you inside that stand up and realize that you're not getting the best part of this ecosystem, you can change this ecosystem. So if you really look at it as an ecosystem, it's not benefiting you unless you're at the top. There are ways to change this ecosystem. And it doesn't matter if they're all crumble, but there's ways to change this. But you have to be willing to get over the fear and stand up together to do it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1619s)

Because there are so many people, like I could write their names down and it would be pages and pages and pages of people that know that this is wrong. You know, I was speaking to my husband earlier about commerce in the assembly, how that was an issue in JTJr.'s time. Now, it's flipped around to the assembly is commerce. Look at this stuff. If you can't see it, you must be blind or stupid or thick because people left over commerce being brought into the assembly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1658s)

Or they have these spokespersons that come out and they talk about how the UBT is not affiliated whatsoever with their church. Yet you go on to the UBT website, on the UBT website is a whole section of where they're selling hymn books and the canvases of the great leaders. There's this whole section of everything that is a part of the Brethren and the PBCC community that is being sold on the UBT.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1689s)

Yes, UBT is solely for Brethren. They don't do anything for anyone else. You've got UBTA, which is like the accountancy side of things. I'll go into a pie chart in a bit, but once you see it as black and white as it is, it is solely for Brethren. They can argue as much as they want but those that know and are not scared to tell the truth will tell you this is a Brethren from structure, it's for Brethren only and it's for, and as we've seen in that email, the snippet of the email, it's to sustain their ecosystem so they can be separate from the world.

Because I remember when the school shops were set up, they said about the mark of the beast is coming. And I believe it, I believe it. And where you'll have like a chip inside you where you can go and that's how you pay for your groceries, it's how you pay for this, it's how you pay for that. I mean, we're nearly there with our phones, aren't we? You can just tap your phone and that's your shopping paid for. But they say in the near the end, we won't be able to go in shops. So that's [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1764s) they've like, Christians won't be able to go in shops. I don't know how they're going to work it, but anyway.

And people will be knocking on the school shop doors because that's the only ones that they can go to. So they're trying to paint this picture that they are going to save the world because all the Christians in the world, because they're the only ones with school shops. So then everyone's like really believing in it and they take it in as this, we're going to change the world thing. And that's how they get so many people so interested in it. But it's obviously the small shop where their children go side of things. It's very, very clever.

Anyway, back to the endowment fund, they raised 500 million [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1815s) one seminar, which when it came out on the email, it was a strictly community only global ecosystem event.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1825s)

And then we've got, let me go back up. Yeah, so the directors of high profit, high donation businesses.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1836s)

So people that give donations out the business profit to either the endowment fund or wherever they put it into schools, they are given what is known as in the Brethren as Levite kind of status. So once a year, there's Levitical meetings held in, at the moment they're in Sydney, used to be Leeds and all over the place, Brisbane, Melbourne, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1867s) at the moment they're in Sydney. And it was a men, more or less men only event, of which I've been to one of actually, because obviously I lived in Sydney.

And it was just a mass of white shirts everywhere with two rows of sisters just around the outside balcony. It was like the misogyny in here just reeks. So the only reason a sister would be there from [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1897s) of Sydney is if her husband was a close friend of Bruce Hales. So that's the only way that sisters could have got into it. So it's basically like a big F-off man holiday for those who would work extra, extra hard.

And you know, it's in ministry, in their ministry about not going on boats, you wouldn't have meals out. All of a sudden, they can do whatever the hell they want to do in this one week. You know, there's boat trips [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1927s) alcohol, there's like entertainment activities. I'm trying to think of an example. I think people went out to restaurants.

And I remember a story, a man went out there and he had made a commitment years before that he would not ever go into a restaurant. And the rest of them went in there and he stayed outside to make a stand because he made this commitment on the back of Bruce Hales's ministry that he would not go in a restaurant. Go to [Sydney,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1958s) right under Bruce Hales's nose with some of his family, they go in the restaurant and he stays outside. Like the hypocrisy is just incredible. So that's what the Levite status is. And because they're given that status, they benefit from the system.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1978s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=1978s)

Then we've got the Grace Trust, which is the charity piggy bank basically. So I'm on, I think on some other podcasts, did someone speak about it that they haven't, they haven't actually put their accounts online or something, or maybe it was a post on Facebook, I can't actually remember. But so it's really interesting in how they structure of how they've donated. So most of it is to RRT and then they've got other charities within the Brethren and then they've got like naught point something, something, something percent is to say the air ambulance society or something. So that's how they say, look, we're giving, we're giving and it's like 500 pounds.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2035s)

So you remember a post like that, that they were talking about the little minuscule amount that they were actually donating versus what they were putting back in their own pocket.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2046s)

Which leads us on to RRT, which is the costly side of running this ecosystem. So you've got Bruce Hales's security team to keep him safe. Like what from? None of us give a shit about you, mate. Then you've got the legal team, which would oversee any threats or attacks from outsiders. So you've got a team on constantly monitoring the ex-Brethren from Facebook pages for any like infringement of copyright things going on or, you know, any people whose businesses have been affected by the Hales’s or UBT speaking out about it.

They will try and nitpick for anything that they can get a hold of so they can sue or counter sue or whatever they want to do. And you've got people who are monitoring those that come out with a sexual abuse allegation after they've left. So they will then try and pay them out or whatever they want to do or put their thumb on them or get that carpet up and sweep it under.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2124s)

Or pay people to sweep it under a carpet.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2127s)

Yes, exactly. Or they'll pay for someone to investigate people. I mean, we know that's happened.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2135s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2137s)

It's scary, the power they have, actually. And then I don't know why I put this at the bottom of the list, really, because this should be at the top, because the RRT was set up at the beginning of the Charity Commission matter, as they put it, which I remember praying for years back, the Charity Commission matter, like I was a kid then, it's just really sad. And this was set up [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2167s) try to show to the Charity Commission that they are there for charitable causes.

Now if the Charity Commission saw what went on in the background, they'd realized that it was a massively cleverly orchestrated PR stunt. Yeah. Now I was around obviously in the time that the RRT progressed to be what it is now, where they're sort of shaking hands with MPs and stuff and quickly get a snapshot of that. And as they're setting up the tent or whatever they want to set up, there's strict instructions of make sure you're in the most visible place to the press, that you're in the most, like the sign has to be in a certain place in a certain position and so that they can try and show what incredible team they are now.

And another one of the instructions is to make sure that young people aren't out the front actually talking to those that attend.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2235s)

Yeah. Don't engage in conversation to any depth. I'd heard that one.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2242s)

So the whole thing is controlled from the minute that blinking RRT banner comes out to the minute it goes away, which is super sad. You know, let people talk, let people, you know, it'd be good for young people to actually be challenged by these people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2261s)

Yeah, I think when it first started and as I say, amongst the ex-Brethren community, there was quite a lot of frustration at it. The one thing you did, a few people did say is this maybe an opportunity for the younger members of Brethren to get out there and talk to people in the world and actually engage and talk on a level. But then you slowly realize that that wasn't allowed either. So that's not [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2291s) to happen. So yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2293s)

Yeah, if you started, you'd be called over, "Oh, can you flip the burgers?" You know what I mean? Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, would be a task maybe back to his house. Yeah, so the whole thing is controlled. I think charitable work, the real charitable work is done inconspicuously.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2315s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2316s)

But no, they've got a big red, blue, flashy, top of the range, everything. And it's all just a big show. And people inside are also aware of that as well. But they get involved because, oh, this is a bit of drama. It's a bit different from normal life. We get to miss meetings. We're going to help the firefighters. We're going to cook them burgers. And they're targeting the people who are the heavily, emotionally taxed people like firefighters, for example, Grenfell Tower. I can't even start to imagine some of the sights that those firefighters would have seen. And they would have been crippled, emotionally crippled, mentally and, "Do you want a burger?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2374s)

And they make them pose for pictures, right? Like I sincerely, I was watching a video just recently of the RRT in Vancouver at the hospital and they were feeding all the nurses, they were feeding them and all these pictures. And I sit there looking at these pictures and I'm like, how many of these nurses and doctors and all these people actually wanted to pose for a picture? Right? I just don't get how this Christian community, so-called Christian community, can sit there and call [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2404s) call this charitable work when we know it's just about the picture, it's just about the video, it's just about getting your name out there. It's sad, it really is sad.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2416s)

Yeah, and for them to pick on the vulnerable, more vulnerable side is incredible. You know, they're not going to Africa to feed the poor little kids that, yeah, you know what I mean? Yes, they did something for Ukraine, but again, that was a massive PR stunt because all were involved in Ukraine as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2438s)

Yeah, do it and do it from, do it because you sincerely want to give charity. Yes, and because you really care. Exactly. Yes, absolutely. So I'm just going to check that I've covered all that. Yes, I have.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2461s)

So we've kind of covered this as well, but it was, I just want to reiterate that that seminar for the 500 million pounds was set up as a community only global ecosystem event. So they don't want outside people to know because outside people would clock, like what the hell is this? Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2484s)

And do you know that 500 million that was raised in whatever it was, two days or whatever, was that just the UK part of it?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2491s)

No, that was globally.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2493s)

Okay.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2494s)

So it was completely, yeah, so 500 million amongst around 50,000 people, including children. It's just nuts amounts of money. So this is the pie chart that I was referring to. So this is really interesting and it shows exactly how their ecosystem is working or how I'd say Bruce Hales's business structure is working. Yeah, and this is from a Strive 23 team.

So at the [top,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2537s) of course, there's 'Maintain our way of life'. And it's really interesting that this is at the top because that's everyone's priority at the moment. In the UK, there is, well, it's probably globally as well, but there's kind of like a financial crash going on. There's the interest rates have heightened for things like mortgages and loans and stuff like that. So people are really having to tighten [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2567s) purse strings and to be able to keep up the level of spending and the higher level of their lifestyle.

Well, that's everyone's priority. I mean, how I can imagine sisters thinking, how am I going to afford to do a Lord's Day dinner? Because their food is so extravagant. So they're really going to have to cut back. So 'Maintain our way of life'. Underneath that, you've got UBT household, One Medi Fund, Orbit, RRT and Campus\&Co. So UBT household is mainly about how are we going to budget? What are the 12, I think I remember it called like the 12 points of running a household.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2620s)

I wrote it down to be on the phone second. Yeah, a 12 point plan. I've got all my notes from when I was in there, you see.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2631s)

So you've got a 12 point plan of what to do when you're in financial struggles. In some of those 12 points, let's have a look. So like, yeah, you'd call a family meeting and go over what things are most important to you and then you'd forensically look through each thing and say, what can we cut out? What can we keep? Which is actually really important in a household, but the fact that they're telling you to do that to help [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2661s) to survive in this ecosystem is, well, they're raking in 500 million dollars in two days.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2664s)

And this goes along with where I've had reports from insiders and reports from principals and teachers where there's actually been people going to food banks. Like this is so wrong about this situation. Yeah, is that if you are this wealthy and you're asking, you've got this kind of money inside here, yet people from your congregation and flock are having to [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2694s) to food banks. Yeah, it's just not right. Yeah, it's sad. Really sad.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2700s)

Because actually those people that are going to food banks don't want to out themselves that they're struggling because then those that struggle are absolutely bullied. Yes, no doubt about it. I'll come on to the initiative they set up called Vision Welfare for those that are less wealthy, slash poor. I say poor, but in the non-Brethren sense, they're not actually poor. They're just not, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2737s) just can't keep up the level of what everyone else is at up here. They're not poor at all. They're just less than the rest of them, but they feel poor because look what else they've got to compare it to.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2749s)

Yeah, their ecosystem is very high demanding.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2752s)

Yes. So that was the Vision Welfare was set up. So they did a red button through UBT and they did a green button. So the red button was for households that are struggling to fill out a form and to be able to get vouchers for things like school shops or so that they do their food shop at the school shop or they can get help from local brothers [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2782s) dip into their knowledge of what they can do. I don't actually know if like checks were given. I don't know. Or cash was given. I don't know.

And then the green, oh, by the way, on the red button, it was said that it was confidential. Now, I was told by certain high up brothers in our locality who had pressed that red button in our locality. So the whole confidentiality thing is bullshit. It's complete bullshit. You will go onto a spreadsheet where the higher [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2824s) the hierarchy will all get to see.

I mean, when you fill in that spreadsheet, you put every single outgoing, every single income. So they know exactly where you're at. And you think it will just be for your local Brethren. Get a grip. Everyone is looking at your personal household finance details. To me, that's really scary. And then it filters out into the community that your household is struggling. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2855s) then at this OneSchool Global, which is there to apparently protect and educate our young, I'm sorry, I just went like that to read it, that's when the children that are less wealthy will be bullied.

Because why haven't you got this and this and this? Look at your shoes, the soles are falling off. Like I had that at school. I was really badly bullied because my parents couldn't afford, well, they probably could, but they didn't buy me new school shoes. Maybe they couldn't afford them, I don't know. But my soles were literally falling off my shoes. And I got bullied for that. And the amount of wealth that's [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2895s) there, you'd expect someone to pull you aside and be like, "Hey, should we go shoe shopping?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2899s)

Exactly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=2899s)

500 million in two weeks, someone can buy you a new pair of shoes. But no, instead they'll bully you. So I go on to OneSchool Global. So this was set up way back by John Hales, I think. And there was a blueprint, but John Hales outlined how he wanted the schools to work. And Bruce Hales has taken that from his daddy and works it all out.

So the schooling as a whole is a very good schooling system, as long as you're not going to get bullied, you're not going to get sexually harassed and you don't pretty much don't need to go to university because they'll streamline you to be ready to go into Brethren businesses. So it was set up to take the children away from worldly influence. And you know, some of the things that are going on in non-Brethren schools is scary now. Some of the stuff that's filtering through to education, I mean, I'll still take my children out of, but that's really easy to do and that's an option with schools.

But it's the overall things of videos and which present children are accessing now. But you know, they just don't want the children to have access to the outside world because they might be, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3000s) know, they might want to be a doctor or they might want to be a policeman. And so they'll take all the influences of the outside world away so that they're more likely to keep the children within and they'll get married and then they'll breed and they'll keep the ecosystem going. Sadly, there are high levels of sexual abuse in those schools, both between children and from teachers to children, as I've covered myself personally in my story. And there's also chronically high levels of bullying, like it's scary.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3042s)

Yeah, the bullying is what we hear of the most. Like when I get emails coming in and phone calls, it's, yeah, it is. Everybody has that same theme of the hierarchy and the intense bullying. Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3058s)

Oh, it's because you never get away from it. You know, you go to school, you're an hour on the school bus to get to the school. For some children it's more, for some children it's less, that's just an average. If your bullies are on your school bus, immediately you're double screwed because you've got those extra hour in the morning, hour in the evening with those bullies. And then you've got after that, I'm not sure if I covered this in one of my previous podcasts. You did, yeah. Did I? Yeah. So basically, you can't get away from them at all. So the bullying is so much more intense. You know, I had it said to me so many times, the bullying that you'd get in non-Brethren schools is worse than [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3105s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3105s)

It's not.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3107s)

It's not. Not by far. Because do you know why? Non-Brethren schools are equipped and prepared to actually deal with it, no matter who your family is, what surname you've got, where in the hierarchical system you are, they will deal with it. They don't care about that. All they care about is the welfare of that child.

There's one child in my local place that was bullied, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3138s) he was bullied for the most stupid yet nasty, nasty, nasty reasons. You know, that child is going to suffer for the rest of his life because of the bullying. I remember one lad down in the south of England and he was hung upside down out of windows and told, "You want us to drop you? Do you want us to drop you?" In like, you know, four story high school. You're telling me that that would happen in an outside school? Never. And if it did, those children would be removed immediately from that school.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3181s)

And, you know, we had a conversation with an anonymous, very influential principal teacher that was in a very influential part of everything. And the stuff that she told us, like jaw-dropping, mind-blowing stuff that goes on behind the scenes and the accountability, like that's the [problem,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3211s) is that these teachers can go, like they, especially if they're female, there's no accountability when they take this stuff to the higher-ups that are supposed to be looking after this because it just gets swept. It's all these bullies' kids' fathers who are on the board that you're taking it to. Well, that's just nothing that's done with it, right?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3231s)

Yeah, you're absolutely smack on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3234s)

Yeah, I wish I had my notes here from that phone call. I don't have them right here, but man, it deserved, obviously she had to stay anonymous, but just the stuff that she had expressed to us and the teachers that went missing. It's just crazy. It is really not a schooling system, right? It is part of their whole brainwashing, part of their program, right? That's what its main [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3264s) is to do. That's why there isn't accountability. I've said this from day one that this system is not broken. It's doing exactly what it needs to do to keep your tails at the head at the top of his business. Yes.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3279s)

Absolutely. And when he carks it, it will hand down to whoever's got the most in the bank, probably.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3286s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Or whoever digs it out the best. Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3290s)

Yeah. And on that point, I'm really miffed at the moment because, you know, inside we, you know, he was the seventh elect vessel. So therefore the rapture was going to come before he died. Now he's just had heart surgery. So you know, he's obviously a very poorly person. He could die tomorrow, any of us could die tomorrow. But like, where's this, you know, he's a seventh elect vessel, where's the rapture? He ain't got that long left. Anyway, that's just a by the way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3330s)

And I mean, I just, I mean, this is a whole other podcast on it, so we could go off and digress here. But I mean, for him to be as holy as he says he is, he should have never had these heart issues, right? That's my thinking, is that they should have never been there if you are the holy man that you are. And I know that there's a lot of blame that's being placed on the Brethren, right? That it's, you know, it's the stress they put on him and you know, blah, [blah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3360s) blah.

Well, no, like that isn't, that is not, that is not true, right? Like this Man of God should be, if you are put in that position, you're believing that this is the position and this is all that it holds and you should be able to handle all of it, including these ex-members who are now finally brave enough to come forward and be able to deal with it. If you're sitting in that throne position, you should have the capability and the capacity to be able to be dealing [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3390s) it all.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3390s)

Yeah, or the people like me who wrote and tried to speak to countless times about sexual abuse, you should be able to deal with those people. Yeah, not...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3402s)

Just my opinion. I'm like, I don't believe in a Man of God and a like vessel anyhow, but I'm like, if you're going to take on that role, you know what it consists of. And you're saying you've had the, you know, you had this mystical experience or whatever was said that he had, you know, he talked to Jesus himself. And I mean, if you're having all these capabilities, then you should be able to have the shoulders to be able to hold the load that's with that.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3430s)

Yes. And I know we've completely digressed, but the new church that we went to, that we've been to since we left the Brethren, they did a study on Exodus 18 on the Sunday just gone. And Exodus 18 is about obviously Moses in the wilderness and or when he left Egypt. And Exodus 18 sets out everything about what leadership should look like. And these are some of the points: good leaders humbly respect others, good leaders focus on what God has done, not what they have done, good leaders are willing to change, good leaders are wise about delegating, good leaders appoint other good leaders, and good leaders point everyone else to the greatest leader who is God, slash Christ. Now, if you look at those points and, you know, red flag alert, I looked at them after.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3497s)

And five out of the six, he is not. And I've left number two out because sometimes he does focus on what God has done in his preaching. So that's only sometimes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3514s)

You know, I had somebody from inside message me recently talking about even the Lord's Supper on Sunday. For those that are not Brethren, that is like communion, what regular church's communion is. And how the focus has even been placed on Bruce at the Lord's Supper now, right? And how it really disheartened this person. And I'm sure he's not the only person, but it's just when you start, when you start taking God [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3545s) of the church and placing a man, you're asking for trouble.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3549s)

Yeah, I think it's blasphemy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3551s)

Absolutely.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3551s)

I think it's, it's actually against God to do that because we've got Jesus, we've got the Holy Spirit, we've got God on our side. Why do we need someone else? We don't. So anyway, we've completely gone off topic. Let's get back to the topic.

So then after the school, we've got improved profits of community businesses. Yeah, of course it is. So you've got UBT and UBTA. So UBT, as we've mentioned just now, their priority is to oversee, in my opinion, this is the whole of the Brethren immediate ecosystem. So you've got, you've got how to run a household basically. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3607s) also in UBT, you've got how to run a business in the way that they think is best, which actually necessarily isn't necessarily so.

And then you've got UBTA who have their own accountants for the Brethren businesses and also for UBT. And they, yeah, mind-blowing, isn't it? I can't imagine like the loopholes they try and get through. So their job mainly really is to reduce taxes and pay as less to the government as possible. That's basically what their job is.

Then you've got fund education and welfare needs. I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3646s) know what NAF is. I've never heard of it before. So whether that's something that's been set up since I've left, I'm not sure.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3652s)

I think the NAF is the National Assistance Fund and I think they're New Zealand based, but I'm not 100%. So it's a, yeah, it's a bit like Grace Trust somewhere else, I think. But don't totally quote me on that one, but I think it's National Assistance Fund. But yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3667s)

GFT, which is the charitable side of things, Grace Trust invests in the Vision Foundations. So the Grace Trust is making it possible to invest in three UK businesses this year.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3689s)

Well, they're three Hales businesses, I wonder.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3692s)

Most likely. So they're using the Grace Trust money to invest in businesses. So the Grace Trust, though, is a charity in UK law. So how they're working that, I'm not sure. Surely that's against the law to actually be investing that money in businesses. I don't know, especially Brethren businesses.

They are exceeding [targets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3725s) in Grace for Grace Trust campaigns. Here we go. So their funds are enabling us to continue supporting the community and hundreds, hundreds of wider community charities next year. They're not, they're barely touching wider community charities, barely. You know, it's like a couple hundred quid here and there. Most of it is supporting the PBCC. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3755s) then you've got the Vision Foundation, which is obviously covered.

And TyreMax was set up years ago and it's something to do with truck tires. I don't know how they've worked it because I was never interested in it, but it was one of the first big global wholesale businesses and it's got something to do with tires. I don't know the ins and outs.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3778s)

I actually had a conversation with somebody who's associated with the PBCC, he's not, he was never a member. And I had a really long conversation, I remember TyreMax was brought up in it and he was really focused on the TyreMax and how wealthy it was and what they were doing with it. And I couldn't relay the whole story and message. It is on the list of things that need to be talked about in a podcast with someone that actually knows how to talk about that because I didn't quite understand, but there was a lot of controversy in it and I have my notes and it's on the list to be talked about.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3817s)

Yeah, well, it's on that, it's on that chart for a reason. And I said to my husband, TyreMax, why is it there? Like it's got to have some kind of significant importance, but I couldn't tell you why it's that significant and important other than it being financially extremely beneficial to actually be put on the grand pie chart.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3838s)

And there's a story around it with that. I wouldn't be able to relay it all, but I just remember being like, holy crap, I can't believe that that happened. And I wouldn't be able to relate enough to be viable on a podcast. So we'll leave it for someone to come forward and be like, hey, I can explain that story and then we'll bring them on.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3859s)

Yeah, that'd be great. And then we've got the elevation of circumstances set up, which obviously is the last bit on the pie chart, isn't it? Because you always start from the top, that's just how it works. So you've got the Vision Welfare, which I've covered already, which is making sure everyone can afford the Brethren lifestyle. You've got UBT Assist and that kind, the two kind of integrate, apart from UBT Assist is more for businesses than households. And then you've got [HR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3889s) 100 which is basically advertising jobs for Brethren, Brethren only. So the 100 is to have 100% of the Brethren employed. That's their target because, you know, you can't have anyone feeling left out, they might get a little bit disgruntled and leave. So that's there in place to make sure that employment is ticked. It's a bit of a tick boxing exercise.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3925s)

Yeah, I was gonna say, do you want to comment on the Orbit?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3927s)

Yeah, so Orbit was set up, I can't remember exactly when. It's always been there lurking in the background, but it's been made more a thing of now with the Connect app and that's run alongside Orbit. So if for example now, if you want to go away, even if it's to your mum's two hours down the road, you have to inform Orbit so your travel is monitored. Yeah, especially if you want to go abroad. If you want to [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3957s) abroad, you have to get like written permission from them that you can go abroad to see relatives, family, friends. Usually now if people want to go abroad, it's only for business purposes. You wouldn't actually generally go abroad to see your family because that would be Midianite-ish.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3977s)

Wow.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3977s)

Which I just think is completely bizarre.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3980s)

So in this app, you put all your information in like when you're going? Yeah, I see.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=3985s)

And then when you go to fellowship meetings, it will be uploaded to the app where you're going for dinner, where you're going for tea, who you're staying with, and it will put all their contact details on the app. So it's literally like making your life easier, basically. And did I cover OneMedifund earlier? I'm not sure if I did or not, but it's Brethren only health insurance. So it's just health insurance set up for Brethren.

So you can see what an incredible business plan it is to oversee. I mean, you know, I look at that and I think, where's Jesus in this? Where's the church in this? Where's what actually matters in this? It isn't. You've just got money, money, money, money, wherever you look. And that's one of the reasons we left because we didn't agree with it at all.

And this was a clipping from an email that was sent around to the locality in 2022\. So there was a fundraiser set up for GFT. And it says;

 "Thank you for all the generous pledges made to GFT from both personal and business donors as a campus."

 So this is one locality, one campus.

 "We've gone through our target of 1.7 million. You can read the rest of the numbers. And now I've got 1.79 million. If that yet, [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4086s) yet to finalise a pledge, any extra money is received above the target will certainly not be wastefully spent, as there are still many needs in welfare, external charities and further RRT work. Let's keep the ecosystem moving. I'd like to remind anyone who has not managed to set up their direct debits for next year to do so now. Please bear in mind that any remaining payments for 2021 do not get cancelled when setting this up. This year is not quite finished yet."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4118s)

Still more million dollar mansions to be bought.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4121s)

Oh yes. And it's all about we need your money, we need your money, constantly we need your money. Like we used to pay, I think it was either £250 or £300 a month to GFT. And now I'm like, I want a refund, guys. I've left. Yeah, I want it back. Yeah, like I can't. But that's how sucked into the system we were because it's so master mindfully clever that we were like, yes, we need to do this. And we were one of the guys that didn't give, like that was pittance compared to what other people were giving. So I dread to think what other people were giving if we were nobody's.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4174s)

Wow.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4187s)

Thousands, thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds. And then we received things like this;

"On behalf of all the enterprises that we support, we'd like to convey grateful thanks to all of you who responded to the 2022 GFT campaign. The strong support we received resulting in hitting 103.5% of target. So not only was the target fully met but also further substantial funds raised for the endowment fund. We cannot emphasise enough how thankful we are for every single [donation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4217s)."

So 103.5% of target they met. So it's just nuts amount of cash floating around in there. For some it's floating around, for others it's really, really almost like a sacrificial in some ways to actually be able to donate the amount of money that they are. 

"But also the much needed work [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4248s) reaching out to mankind in need."

 Mankind in need? Oh my days, get a grip. They don't give a crap. Like take homeless people for example now. People that are less than Brethren, they will treat like rubbish. Homeless people, what are they like? I have great respect for homeless people. They are fighting not only sometimes mental battles, but physical battles against living on the streets. And then [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4293s) some pompous Brethren twit walks up and like, for example, I went out with a couple of people that were my age and they were like, "Why haven't you got a house?" Like, are you joking? That's just, I think...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4308s)

That's, I remember a quote once, "All of us are only a few bad decisions away from homelessness." We don't know why people are there. And as you say, the arrogance that they are somehow inferior. We don't know their story, we don't know why they're on the streets. And actually to say something like that to them, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4332s)

Some of them are doctors that have got into, yeah, family problems or like they have qualifications under their belt. They would have been financially...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4343s)

Yeah, they never know somebody's story.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4348s)

And a lot of them are people that have fought for our country.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4352s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So get Bruce Hales talking to, because he's always banging on about John Hales in the army. So can you imagine Bruce Hales talking to someone on the street that was a veteran?

 "So any that have missed the campaign, the door is never closed for donations and they'd be much appreciated."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4383s)

There's a theme coming through here, Abi. There's a theme coming through here. Is there? Right, please donate.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4390s)

It goes on about having covered the essential funding shortfall for 2022\. 

"The ability to support the endowment fund is a critical factor in becoming a sustainable community."

That was rammed down everyone's throats that the endowment fund, you know, we're going to fail, we're going to have to give up our lifestyles unless we have this endowment fund to back us up.

So this was from, I think this was from like a UBT email address, I can't actually remember.But it goes on to thank people from each sector. So you've got OneSchool Global;

"Attracting, retaining and developing staff to ensure students get the best possible learning experience. Graduate life ready." 

Oh, that just makes me sad. That makes me sad. That makes me very... they're not going to graduate life ready. They're graduating with tools to be able to combat life in a Brethren business, but real life, real, real life, you know, no.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4476s)

And the tertiary education that they do, a lot of, a few people have left, have tried to use those qualifications to get, you know, jobs and they've been told they're not worth the paper they're written on, basically.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4489s)

Really? That's so interesting because most of them do a course called ABM, which is Advanced Business Management. None of these people are cut out to manage a business. I run a business and you know, if I put some of those people that do those courses in our positions, I'm not saying we're good at it, but you know, they would absolutely be crippled. So yeah, that makes me sad because he's definitely not ready for life.

"The resilience of our staff, parents and students throughout 2021, obviously that would have been throughout COVID and all the lockdowns and all that, has been appreciated. As we move to 2022, it will take forward the key learnings and successes in view of further delivering on the global vision."

Now, COVID was interesting with OneSchool because apparently some of the top schools, this is what was said amongst the Brethren anyway, so whether it's true or not, I don't know, but apparently some of the schools were ringing up OneSchool saying, "You are ready for this, like for this COVID outbreak. You've got, you already do self-directed learning, you've already got stuff in place for students to still be able to communicate with their teachers and learn when they're not at school." They're like, "How did you do it? How did you know?"

And all the Brethren were like, "Well, it's Bruce Hales, you know, he knew this was coming and, you know, such a miracle worker and we're so grateful that he knew so that our kids can continue education." And they took it as like, "Yes, look at us, we're being contacted by the best schools in the country about how we've figured this out." Whereas actually, I think self-directed learning is just a money saving thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4621s)

It's always been in the mainstream schools, it always has. And so has, up to a point, so has virtual, up to a point.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4630s)

Right, okay. Yeah, most, a lot of lessons in there are virtual. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4636s)

Yeah, I agree with you. I think it is a money-saving thing because if they've got, if you look at the OneSchool Global brochures, they advertise that the students do virtual lessons for students from campuses and even worldwide. And that's probably true, but if you put, you know, 50 pupils in front of a screen worldwide with a lecturer up on the screen, either narrated or whatever, that [saves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4666s) on teaching costs a lot. Big time.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4670s)

Big time. And it's fun for the kids because they're like, "Hey, look, there's so and so from so and so." Like they're probably not actually listening to the lesson because they're so excited. Yeah, are you figuring out your life partner? Yeah. And then it goes on to Vision Welfare, thank you for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4694s)

This was all part of the same email.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4696s)

Yes. Wow. Yes. And this is how they'll filter scriptures in to help you feel good. So they've used Proverbs 22 verse 9: "He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of his bread to the poor." Well, how about that against the scripture that talks about the love of money being the root of all evil? Yeah, so they're picking and choosing which they cherry pick their scriptures, very much so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4727s)

And it's clever. It's really clever. And it works.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4730s)

"Vision welfare continues its work to elevate people in need." 

They're not necessarily in need. Okay. In the real world, those people in need in the Brethren would be your middle class people. So they're not necessarily people in need in the real world, they're people in need to sustain the rich lifestyle that the Brethren have. 

"Relieve pressures on the widows."

 The [widows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4765s) do suffer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4768s)

And then we go on to RRT.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4777s)

"Whilst RRT is one cog in a big wheel…”

 yeah, I could say that\!

“Our outreach to mankind continues to be of all importance and it's only possible with the kind pledges that we've received. 2022 is set to be an exciting year with new and existing initiatives." 

Right, who has, I mean, I don't know, but it just sounds, 'initiatives' is a bit of a funny word when you've got all these other initiatives going on to be using in conjunction with RRT. Like you don't want to let that out that it's an initiative, guys. Do you know what I mean? It's a bit sort of putting yourself in the shit there, isn't it, by using that word? 

"Thank you for all your support, both financially and voluntarily. SmaRRT supporter program."

Okay, I don't actually know what that is, but I presume it's for businesses to be able to donate directly to RRT because look how they've spelt 'smart'.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4843s)

Yeah. And then you've got the Grace Trust, which I covered a bit earlier with the wider charities. And then you have the Vision Foundation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4865s)

I think the Vision Foundation is their basic, their venture capitalist arm, isn't it, where they invest in companies. Right, okay, something like that. Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4875s)

But that's my money. Yeah, do you know what I mean? Like I donated to that. Yeah, I want to know where it's going. Yeah, but most just like, just let them do what they want. You know, they know best. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4889s)

Yeah, well, it's that sort of blind trust, isn't it? Blind, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4894s)

So;

 "Generous donations through the past years have enabled us to make significant investments in three UK businesses this year."

 They would have been Brethren businesses obviously, and I expect Hales would have had their fingers in the pie somewhere.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4915s)

Yeah, and what I understand too is that it's not necessarily, they really pick and choose which businesses get that money.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4921s)

Yes, very much so. And also the business may be registered under a slightly different name or just registered as the UK branch, but actually it originated in Sydney. Obviously, you've got things like Ox Group, which is Dean's business in Sydney, but then you've got the Ox Group UK. So it looks like it's completely separate to an outsider, unless they dig deep. And it's probably a bit hard to put two and two together, unless you know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4959s)

Abi, could you go back to the second slide on that presentation where it says what the Brethren buy from UBT. I just want to bring up how this shows that they are being totally ripped off. If you go down to the Trove Music app, could you explain that for us?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=4979s)

Yeah, so the Trove Music app was, I think the £64.90 is actually for a gospel, sorry, it should have been on a different bullet point. So the £64.90 is for a gospel hall recording. So in some meetings, like Bruce Hales said there would never be any musical instruments in meetings and all of a sudden there was. Wow, [shock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5009s) factor. And the bands that played then went to a studio and they recorded these 12 songs, which some were hymns and some were Bruce Hales's favorites.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5022s)

So these are Brethren members playing in the band? It's not a, yes, a brother playing the guitar, playing keyboard and so on? Yes.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5029s)

Yes. And for £64.90 plus VAT, you could buy those 12 songs that were for that.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5036s)

Yeah, the reason I wanted to point that up is that, you know, obviously out here we have Spotify, and for like £5.99 a month, you get unlimited songs of, you know, and yet you're paying £64.90 for 12 songs.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5054s)

Which would have probably sounded absolutely shit. Yeah. Don't get me wrong, there is some serious skill in there and you know, there's hidden talent that will never be found because they're Brethren. Yeah, my husband being one of them. You know, he could have been famous if he was, you know, if he was led down the right route. You know, he's a wonderful musician. And Brethren know that, but it would have never been, "Wow, this lad has talent. Let's nurture it." Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, that was something that was brought out as we were leaving. So I never actually heard them. Not that I would have wanted to. I didn't ever buy anything.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5108s)

No, I just wanted to point out, you know, how they are being totally ripped off.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5116s)

Yeah, yeah. So that's that presentation. I'll stop share now. So that gives you an overview of, I love that pie chart. It's just groundbreaking. Good for them to have something like that on an email. It's just like, it was just like handing us a piece of gold that said, like, yeah, this is how we run it, you know?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5145s)

Absolutely. But an outsider, they'll deny that. They won't be like, "No, what's this?" because they're so good at lying.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5153s)

And I think that's the biggest frustration of all this, is the incredible amount of lies that they cover up. They sit there and they talk about the opposers and these attacks and everything that comes on as that we're lying. I guarantee you, like 100% of us are sitting here trying to bring out all of this truth to come up against all their [lies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5183s)

There's something that happened just recently that's really, really gotten inside my heart and it was, it's this whole praying for the removal of people. When I want to talk about it, it's just, I just got to backtrack into the bullying a little bit and like how their bullying is such an issue. The bullying is just, it like, I've never seen anything like it in the outside world of how much bullying and where it all stems from.

And I mean, I knew of this, right? I mean, you know, you hear and you forget things though, right, when they pray for the [removal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5222s) of things. But I'm only addressing this now is because we're at an all-time high with everything that is coming forward and coming out. And I'm not gonna lie, we've had death threats come this way with understanding now what they're meaning by these threats.

And I just want to let those insiders know that sit back and look at the work we're doing as this [absolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5253s) attack on you. It's not. It is absolutely not. It's just a matter of cleaning up what's been shoved underneath the carpet. And the biggest bomb that you can throw on top of this carpet is sitting back after looking at how big the carpet is and then start praying for the removal of those that have left.

And I just want to give people what removal means. When people pray for the removal, they're praying for our death. So on Monday night prayer [meeting,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5283s) when they're praying for the removal of certain people, that is that they're removed off the planet, right? That is their way of praying for the death of people. This is what they stoop to.

And obviously since we've started this podcast and we've had certain people come on to this podcast and we're revealing very potent information that is not Christian-like. You do not get up in prayer and ask for the removal of somebody. You just don't. And it [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5313s) really ignited something in me that I just can't figure out how my parents don't see through that, how my siblings don't see through that. You don't get up and pray for the removal of somebody. That's not your job. You don't pray to God for them to remove somebody, especially somebody who's been completely sexually molested and abused.

You just don't pray for that. Instead, a Christian would get up and pray for the help that that person needs to restore [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5344s) back to sanity. Yeah, it's just this whole mind blown thing of after we had some stuff come our way that I'm like, no, we need to address this. We absolutely need to address this. And yes, authorities are going to be involved and we don't take this lightly. I do not take this lightly when comments get placed on things and when you're telling somebody that they're going to be dead in a year because Bruce Hales has a track record of that. [No,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5375s) uh-uh, not gonna stand for it.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5378s)

I think it's all part of their brainwashing process that those that leave are evil. I have never been as close to Jesus and to God as I am now once I've left that abusive system and had some time out to think about where I stand between me and God without all the bullshit. I'm not an evil person.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5411s)

Yeah, I just want to bring out the truth of what happened to me, bring out the truth of what's happening to so many children in there, bring out what's happening to adults.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5414s)

And you know, frankly, someone that sits behind a keyboard and types, "You're going to be dead in a year," is just a coward. I don't believe in that's right. I remember, no, and I mean, you can't, I mean, it's just, it's just, well, it's murderous.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5445s)

The Bible, it's ridiculous that they actually believe that Bruce Hales can do this. That's the whole thing is it's just absolutely insane that they think that Bruce has this power. He doesn't. He doesn't have this power. I guess my biggest warning with all of this is that they need to be careful of what they're teaching their young because there are young in there that might [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5475s) ideas that are very, very unhealthy that are going to stem from what they're teaching.

Yeah, they're those kids to stand up and do. And most ex-Brethren say that, right, that once they leave, I remember saying that to my parents, that what I hold in my heart today is so sacred to me and can never be taken away from anybody. And I only found that after I left. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5506s) never found that in there, right?

It's just the bullying is so potent in there. For myself, I agree. Like I completely relate to you in that sense. I just want some peace. Why can't, why does religion have to have such a force of division in it? Why can't religion should be the thing that is sending out love? It's sending [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5536s) a hand, it's sending out peace, it's sending out care and compassion and it should be the thing that ties everybody together, not deviates and separates and wishes such horrible things on people, right?

To me, that's just what my heart wants. I just want some way where we can all be at peace somehow. And I mean, I understand that we live life, life has turbulence, life has its [ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5566s) and downs. But this is absolutely out of this world. It's insane with what we have our hands in now. It's just absolutely insane. It shouldn't be happening. And it should not be happening under the umbrella of Christianity.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5581s)

No, it's because it's the furthest thing from Christianity. So there was a couple of years ago, there was almost like a presentation in the foyer. And a foyer is like the cloakroom of a meeting room, but it's like big. So all the Brethren came out of the main hall into the foyer and there was loads of chairs sat out. And we had this like presentation thing on people that are against us.

And then afterwards, we all signed a document saying that we didn't want to be, we didn't want to be contacted [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5624s) three people. One of them was Lance Christie, I can't remember who the other two were. Richard Marsh, possibly, I can't remember.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5632s)

Some people signed, I do, we do have some people that have said they signed something saying that they would never contact Richard Marsh too?

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5640s)

No, I think that it was rather that they didn't want to be contacted by them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5644s)

Okay, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5646s)

But whichever way round. Now, I made a song and dance of it. I was like, "Yes, let's sign this paper," because I was completely sucked in then. But there were people loitering around the back of the foyer that you could tell didn't necessarily want to sign anything, but then because everyone was looking at them, they felt obliged. And that's why they held it in the foyer. They weren't going to go around household, household, household. They were going to do it in the foyer in public, in public intimidation. Hey, yes. So that you would be singled out if you did not sign that piece of paper.

So a lot of stuff goes on in there like that when intimidation is used to kind of [discreetly,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5695s) subtly force you to sign a piece of paper that you don't necessarily want to. So that's another part of the whole bullying aspect. I was sent a snippet today of, I can't remember what it was called, one second.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5721s)

The sad thing is, is these people, I mean, like, you know, you just freshly out can relate to that is like you get so sucked into the drama of it all. Right. Yeah. I mean, I've heard of a story where like somebody in there actually who had prayed for the removal of somebody felt so bad, called up. This person was out and cried about it to him like that. Like, I don't want to do that anymore. I don't. They felt bad. Like, it's just, that's the scary part of all this is because they believe it so much, right? It's just toys with their heart and mind that I really think Bruce and his minions need to be careful. They need to be very careful or they're going to have something on their hands that they don't want.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5768s)

I think they already have.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5768s)

Yeah, I know, but they really have.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5770s)

If they're not shitting their pants, they should be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5776s)

Yeah, yeah, they should be.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5778s)

Because it gets to a stage where you can't actually pay a lawyer to deal with this crap anymore.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5786s)

No.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5786s)

You have, especially, I think there's going to be very much an uprising from inside. Bruce Hales said that there won't be another Aberdeen. Maybe that's because he doesn't, he's not really into women in bed with him other than his wife, I don't know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5802s)

And I don't think it will happen the way that it did in Aberdeen, right? I do believe that there will be an upheaval, right? Yes. I just hope, a bit, yes. I just hope that it is as smooth as it can be. I just think of my parents that are in there and my siblings and nieces and nephews and I just, you want to be the least kind of tumultuous that it can be, right? Because this isn't, again, we say it again, this isn't about bringing the PBCC down. It's about getting the change to happen [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5832s) there that needs to happen, right?

Like the pedophilia, the sexual abuse has got to be taken care of, the bullying needs to be taken care of, the hierarchy needs to be taken care of, the money needs to be taken care of. It needs to be returned back to just a Christian church where people go to for help and for care and for compassion and to remember what love and light is all about. And family, yes, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5859s)

Yeah, I mean, without all the doctrine, if I took just the bare scriptural, if it was just the bare scriptural stuff, then I probably wouldn't have left. It's when the scriptures are starting to be twisted and twisted and twisted to suit their agenda. I'm not interested. Like the church we go to now is about scriptures, it's purely about scripture.

But it links to this core doctrine legal document that was written by Bruce Hales. And this was something that was sent around and had to be signed about eight to ten years ago. I can't remember exactly when [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5907s) I was, I wasn't married then. And I've never signed it, thankfully.

But point seven: "No action should be taken in any way to treat vindictively, maliciously or unfairly persons whether within or without the community, including those who were within the community and who are leaving or have left the community. Every care should be taken to provide for and support the welfare and education of children's young persons within the community. Where persons seek to leave [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5944s) community, reasonable assistance should be afforded to them in terms of support and or financial assistance relating to employment or other matters where they have been dependent on the community for that support. Reasonable steps should also be taken in these cases consistent with and subject to any legal requirements applying to the persons involved and the human rights of the person."

Human rights? They don't even know what the definition of human rights is. "To allow the continuation of the family relationship where a [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=5974s) member has left the community, including providing access to family members, in particular children. Where a person within the community dies, the principle of separation allows members of the extended family of the deceased, including former Brethren, to attend their funeral service. Any people attending a funeral service, whether from within or out the community should respect the wishes and beliefs of the deceased, behave with dignity and be treated considerably."

So [praying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6005s) for someone to be removed is against what most people would have signed in this document about no action being taken in any way to treat vindictively, maliciously or unfairly people that have left the community.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6019s)

And also a bit about allowing continuation of family relationships where a member has left the community, including providing access to family members, in particular children.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6028s)

That is a complete load of bullshit. My child has not seen his grandparents since, more or less since we left. Bruce's parents haven't seen us. We haven't heard from them in months and months and months. And we're okay, you know, if that's how they want to treat us, fine. Not fine, but that's how we're dealing with it right now. But these documents that they put together and fabricate to make it look like it's not as it is, it's just disgusting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6087s)

And I think like for myself, I come in and I came in and out of communicating with my parents and my family. And I mean, obviously when things got very tumultuous with my husband was another time when I reached out and I really needed, I needed a mom. I needed a mom so badly. But the thing is, is I couldn't get the mom I needed because the mom I needed was so indoctrinated and I actually had to let go and say goodbye because I couldn't deal, I couldn't [deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6118s) with what I was getting.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6119s)

Yeah, it's actually easier sometimes to have nothing to do with them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6123s)

I had to for my own sanity, I had to. And I grieve that every day because what I was getting was not my mom. What I was getting was Bruce Hales's indoctrination of what a mother should be. And that I think they probably find it as painful, but oh, I'm sure they do.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6144s)

Yeah, yeah. I think they're brainwashed to think that we're basically dead to them. We're dead to the Lord, we're dead to everything that we've ever known. We've turned our back on the light or lights or whatever they used to say. And actually, I feel I've completely come into the light. I've realized what I was a part of and our family have realized what we were a part of. And actually the blindfold has been taken off and we're seeing it for real. And that's why we fight so hard here, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6182s)

This is why we're doing what we're doing. Yes. For me, I do it because I hope one day that there's enough stuff that's come forward where all of a sudden either a sibling or a niece or a nephew or a mother or father all of a sudden is like, "Okay, like I've heard enough, I'm done. I didn't know that this was happening." And a lot of people don't know that this is happening, right?

I mean, I have talked to people that I left with and in the age group that I [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6212s) with that give stuff back to their parents and their parents like, "That's not, the Hales has never bought any million dollar mansions. No, they didn't. That's not true." Like they literally believe that that is not true. So the average person within the PBCC do not understand what is happening and they don't have access to these articles, right? They don't have access to any of this because their UBT phones don't get them. And those very law-abiding [PBCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6242s) members don't have those non-UBT phones, right?

And you know, it's just sad. It is just, it breaks my heart. That's what breaks my heart is that I want my parents so badly. They're such good people. They are such good people, yet they are so indoctrinated by Bruce Hales's fear.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6271s)

And they'll also be tainted because you've left.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6275s)

Yes. And now because I've spoken out is, you know, it's even worse now that I've spoken out. But you know what, I think, Abi, this is why we do what we do. I am like, I'm just so grateful. I'm so grateful that you have taken the amount of hours that you have taken and podcast material and given us such a thorough look into what's happening, right? You are one of the most recent [leavers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6305s) that we've had and we literally have gone from point A to point Z.

And I'm looking forward to the information that comes back from ex-members and from insiders once we put this podcast out and be able to collaborate a little bit more because it always happens that this is just a piece of the breadcrumb. I know these podcasts are divinely guided. We go from breadcrumb to breadcrumb to breadcrumb. They always just line up. There's really not [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6335s) much work we have to do in lining things up. So my heart just goes out to you. My heart goes out to all the pressure that you've had to put yourself under to get this all up and going. And the honesty.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6352s)

It's come from my heart. It's come from a place of wanting, wanting change because I know of so many people that are suffering in there and so many people want to escape but they can't because they're part of this ecosystem which has been their whole life. Yeah, and I just want to say there's a whole another beautiful, still Jesus-filled life out here that is truly Jesus-filled, not an elect vessel filled. And we are free. We are really truly free. They speak about being free in the Brethren. No, this is a different kind of free. This is, and I have found my wings, free.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6404s)

Yes, exactly.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6404s)

I'm gonna fly. You can try and put me down, you can try and pray for whatever. I am free.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6414s)

And it feels the entire body, right? Like it's just, yes. I'll remember the first time I ever felt it where I was like, "This is what life feels like. This is what being connected to it all, yes, is this is what it feels like." And that's what I said to my mom, like, "There's no, I would never put myself back in that situation to lose this part of my spirit, to lose this part of my soul because for once I [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6444s) feel the love of it all." Yeah, and it's just there. I didn't, it is, it's a beautiful, beautiful experience. I still very heavily for my family. I do, it is, it is. But I use it as fuel to put in this change that needs to happen. Yes, yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6465s)

I also want to say that there is a social media team that has been created who are constantly watching your likes of Instagram, your Facebook, you this, you that, and constantly monitoring who's following who. So if you're gonna, if you want to break out and you want to go on one of these social media platforms, well just set your account to private, whatever you're in, just set it to private so that they can't, you can do a fake name.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6505s)

Like you can do these other names. I have a lot of people who message me with alternative names and then private message me with who they are and what's going on. So that is a way to get into contact. And I do have to really stress the Olive Leaf Network. It's oliveleaf.network, which is a website that Lindy and a huge team have put together. Utilize that website. It is super important website [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6535s) get inside.

There's so many resources at the end of our podcast. It's not an updated resource list of books. There's so many books out there that I have realized that are out there and I didn't know. So please utilize the oliveleaf.network website and all the resources that are on there and the way that you can contact people from off that website. It's very, it's all discreet.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6557s)

Thanks, Cheryl. Yeah, that's brilliant. And there are people that will break free.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6563s)

Yeah.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6564s)

I know there are and I believe in them. And we've just got to hope and pray that they find true freeness, no, freedom.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6574s)

But yes. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you so much, Abi. It was so great to have you here. I am so excited to get these podcasts out and I'm sure you'll be no stranger to the show.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6588s)

Well, Abi, all I can say is thank you so much for this evening. It's been absolutely fascinating. A, to listen to your story, which I think genuinely think you're really brave to tell so soon after leaving and I'm sure good will come from that. But secondly, to explain to us your perception of how things are in the PBCC, bearing in mind you're such a recent leaver, has been absolutely fascinating. And you know, if the [PBCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6618s) are a mainstream Christian church, they shouldn't have anything to hide. They shouldn't be ashamed of their ecosystem or anything like that, should they? They should be saying it's wonderful, you know, we've got this sussed, guys, you know.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6632s)

But the global warming is going to get very hot when they, yeah, when they realize their ecosystem is where it's headed for. But yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6640s)

Yeah, no, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6645s)

It's been interesting to get up to date with everything that's going on inside there as well, with all the different bits and bobs.

Yeah, and also how it felt being inside so recently, particularly during Covid times, I think, because we've often said as outsiders the Covid times must have made quite a difference because suddenly you don't have a meeting every night and then it sort of comes back but they, they can't control it quite the same, although they try. And whether that will change things long term, who knows? That's all we want is change. Yeah. You're welcome with us [anytime,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFIa7Mic-w&t=6684s) Abi. It's been a real pleasure and thank you so much.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
