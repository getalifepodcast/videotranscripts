### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=0s)

Coming up in today's podcast...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3s)

This is a step too far, it's time to get off the crazy train.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9s)

And so, like, this is, for the people, especially for the insiders that are listening to this now, if you're reaching this point where you can't, you don't believe in it, and it doesn't make sense, and you think it's time to take a step back, and then you say, but how can you walk away on 200 years of the testimony? It's not. Like, every step of the way, for 200 years, people have been saying, this has gone too far, this is not okay, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=39s) time to take a step back and walk away. And you are just the latest in a long, long pattern of people raising the alarm.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=49s)

Yeah, of thousands of people raising the alarm and thousands of people doing the same thing. You're not alone, you're not crazy, you're not um, yeah, you're not, you know, on a flight of fantasy. It just might be that actually you're the one who's seeing things really clearly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=63s)

And it's just not talked about, right? Like that's the thing in there. The most that they have to glean any kind of, um, hope of change is Aberdeen, right?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=73s)

Welcome to the Get A Life podcast.

Hi everyone,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=101s)

Welcome back to Get A Life Podcast, where we shine a light on the hidden stories of those who've escaped coercive control and high demand religious groups. I am Cheryl and I'm an ex-member of the Exclusive Brethren, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, from a tiny town in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan in Canada. Before we get to today's podcast, I would like to reach out to every ex-member of the PBCC and anyone who has been a part of a high demand religious group. There is a very important survey that you will [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=131s) here that will help many of us that are battling and fighting for justice in the courtroom as well as helping to create new laws against coercive control. The data collected here is completely confidential and anonymous. If you haven't watched podcast 115 and are unsure about this survey, that podcast will answer all of your questions. We are very much in need of all the ex-members of the PBCC to fill this out if you haven't done it yet. The link will be in the description below.

Today I am so thrilled to have Craig Hoyle with us, author of the riveting memoir Excommunicated. We are joined by his cousin who is also an ex-member of the PBCC and runs a charity to help those leaving any high demand religious groups called the Olive Leaf Network. Welcome guys.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=177s)

Hi, good to be here.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=179s)

Craig's journey out of this cult is one of immense courage, emotional upheaval, and ultimately freedom from a cult that doesn't believe in being gay. His story not only captures the painful reality of being cut off from everything you've known, but also explores the deep personal discovery that comes with reclaiming your life and jumping into those dreams you weren't allowed to have.

What makes Craig's journey through his book Excommunicated even more fascinating is his in-depth exploration of his ancestry. We'll be diving into Craig's experiences, the challenges of leaving, and how uncovering his roots helped him piece together his identity after the cult. We are going to do this podcast a bit different, and Craig is going to take us through the book chapter by chapter, so those that can't read it inside the PBCC can still reap the benefits of this incredible book. I read it in a weekend, couldn't [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=230s) it down, and my mind was blown reading it. Craig, you are a magician with words, and I hope you inspire many other ex-members to write their own stories. As we discuss here on the podcast, these stories and memoirs are so important to be recorded. We live in a time now that allows truth to come forward in ways it was never allowed before. I truly believe this is how we are doing what we are doing. There are many people leaving now and it's books like yours, Craig, that give so much solace and insight. [What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=260s) a crazy ride this has been for you though. Your book is pretty much launched everywhere, I believe now, right? September 6th was North America. How are things going since the first launch for you?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=273s)

Good, it's been a wild ride. The book has been much more popular than even the publishers were expecting and it's on to its third print run now. Oh wow. Yeah, the first print run sold out so they did another one and that one sold out.

So on to a third print run now, and something that's really exciting is we've actually just signed a deal with a TV production company that want to explore turning it into a TV series.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=301s)

Oh wow, that would be great.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=303s)

Yes, yes. So there's been a lot of attention and it's been, um, it's been quite strange for me because I didn't, um, I don't know what I was expecting. I thought that people would be interested in the book for a few months and then it would all go away, um, and that hasn't been the case. I'm still being invited to all sorts of different events and festivals and for the next year. Like I've just had invites through for March next year as well to go to WOMAD, which is [an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=334s) arts and music festival here in New Zealand.

So the attention has gone on for a lot longer than I was expecting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=344s)

You know what though, that book was, it was so easy to read. And so like you literally, you were just flipping through the pages as fast as you could. So like I can see why it's on its third print.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=355s)

And a big shout out here to to Lindy as well who read it all while it wasn't in as good a state as it is now, um, where you went because I mean, this is our family and one of the things that I was super cautious about is when you're representing not just yourself but your family, it's it's a really, it's really challenging and like, am I getting it right? And you want to be, I think you want to tell the truth about [what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=385s) happened without being overly critical. And so Lindy was a huge sounding board for me being like, am I being unfair to our great-grandparents here?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=394s)

Also, it's incredibly complicated to try and, as you say, accurately represent people who are still on the inside and you've obviously had to change some names to protect some people's identity, which some people queried me about. They were like, who's this person? Like I've never heard of that name before. But, um, yeah, for any listeners who don't know that, some of the names were changed to protect identity. But yeah, I think that's an incredibly complex thing that you've done is not only trying to tell the stories of people who are deceased and [historically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=424s) part of this story, but people who are still alive, who are still in the Brethren and people who are out of the Brethren and trying to as accurately as possible represent their stories at the same time as it's very clearly your voice and your story and your perspective.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=440s)

Yeah, and especially when knowing that those people on the inside are going to be angry no matter what.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=445s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=446s)

Um, so you have to thread, like it's such a delicate path to walk and representing them in a way that is fair and comes across as fair to other people while knowing that they are still going to be angry about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=460s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=461s)

Yeah, um, and there's no way, like there's no way that my parents will ever be happy with the fact that this book exists no matter how fair I feel I've been to them. Um, but for me, it was really important that other people who have come out of the Brethren and also for people who are still in there can read this and say, yeah, that that rings true, that happened to me or I can understand how that would be true.

And that's particularly challenging as well when you're writing about those older generations, like our parents' generation, our grandparents' generation. Um, they're still alive and so it's a, it's a huge swing to describe their experiences and what the Brethren were like in their childhood and through their formative years when I wasn't there personally and people who were there are still alive. And it's still one of the things that freaks me out [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=519s) the idea that people will come out of the woodwork and say, I was there in the 60s and that's not what it was like. And so that was a really careful process for me of making sure that as many people as possible or read the manuscript or read different parts of it to check that I had it right.

And it's really small details, things that aren't necessarily recorded in official Brethren history. When I described how the Brethren woman started wearing scarves and I just said, oh well they put this hand on the head and they tie it behind their heads. And someone who read one of the earlier manuscripts was like, actually, when we started wearing scarves, for about the first 18 months, they were tied under our chins and then it moved to being tied behind our heads. And like I would never have known that detail, but for someone who was there, if you get a tiny detail like that wrong, it really stands out.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=580s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Craig, that is another thing that is the huge strengths of the book and kudos to you for this because this book is deeply personal and intimate and it's got your, you know, personal story in it but yeah, equally, like just as powerfully evident is that it's, it is, there's history woven through it and it's as you said, it's been incredibly fact-checked. It's, it's, yeah, very true to what did happen. As you said, you've got multiple different people [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=610s) check it from multiple different generations and historical archives. And that's, I think, yeah, huge strengths of the book. There are many memoirs out there and quite a number now from ex-Brethren. And, you know, there's a real range in quality to them as well and content. And some of them are really highly personal, just about that person's life and their emotions and their immediate experiences. And, you know, that's fine. That's one category. But the huge strength of your book is this incredible attention to detail [spanning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=641s) decades and decades. It's a phenomenal piece of work.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=647s)

When HarperCollins originally approached me about writing this book and they asked me to write it, I didn't have any burning desire to write a book actually, but they reached out and I met the commissioning editor and initially they wanted me to write a book just about my story and I said no because there are a lot of personal stories out there. And I said it's, I am just the result of what happened to my parents and they are the result of what happened to their parents. And sort [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=677s) without thinking it, I started thinking about it. I gave the commissioning editor this like big lecture about 200 years of my family history and what had happened with the Brethren and how you couldn't understand my story unless you understood this 200 years of history.

And then they came back and they're like, why don't you write a book about that?

And I was incredibly lucky that for 200 years, because our ancestors were involved from the very beginning days with Darby, and they all kept records of what they did and what they thought, and why they did what they did. And so Lindy and I are the seventh generation that were involved with Brethren and of those seven generations, the first generation joined and then there were another three [generations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=728s) in the middle that also left. But a generation would leave and the next generation would come back. And so for 200 years, it's been this like really personal, really damaging conflict of going in and out and in and out and in and out.

And everybody believed that they were doing the right thing. And it's only sort of when you look back at it with the benefit of 200 years of hindsight that you can see how incredibly damaging it's been to the family and then how this is just a microcosm of the Brethren movement more widely. And then you think about all the terrible, terrible harm that's been caused by these practices and [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=774s) it really has been going on from the very beginning.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=777s)

I think that's what made this book so different, though, right? Because it was such a different memoir to read. Like, it was so different because it was just so much more than your own personal story. Like, the roots to it gave it such heart. Like, you're sitting there. I mean, I think part of me got healed just reading it, right? It was just, there was so much part in the way that you told it is, I think that's, it was just so fantastic to read.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=806s)

I'm very pleased to hear that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=808s)

It was just incredible.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=810s)

I say to a lot of people that I don't see, obviously I've written it and a lot of it is my story, but I think more broadly, I wanted the book to be our story. And it should be something that speaks to anyone who's come out of the Brethren and then more broadly, anyone who's come out of any controlling environment, be that religious or otherwise, um.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=834s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=834s)

And I'm really pleased that it's having that reaction with people because I never wanted it to be just my story.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=843s)

Yeah, well you've achieved that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=845s)

Yeah, you've achieved that, achieved that. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And, you know, I mean, and I know I, you know, I've had firsthand encounter with insiders who would love to have it in their home, but, you know, some of them still live at home and they, they just don't want to be caught with it. It's just too risky, right? Especially those that have to wait for a certain age to leave or those that are just, you know, not married yet or not wanting to get married and biding their time on leaving. And I think that's why I really, really wanted to do this podcast differently [than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=875s) probably the ones that you've done. So yeah, why don't we start with this? Do you want to start with the very beginning?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=885s)

Sure. So for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, this is what the book looks like.

For those that can...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=893s)

Get it, go get it. I'll put a link below, especially for the ones in North America now that can get it. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=900s)

Awesome. And just to explain the cover. So that is me when I was, I don't know, 12 or so. And then the two, this is my grandparents on their wedding day, and their wedding picture was cut in half after my grandpa was withdrawn from. And so that's why that picture has been torn apart like that. And the idea with the design was to show the history and also the fact that families are being torn apart. So [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=930s) what the cover's about.

And we were thinking that we would work through, we'll just go through the book chapter by chapter and I'll read out a few pages from each chapter and then we'll just chat about it as we go along.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=945s)

Yeah, that sounds really good.

Shall I read the bit because it's a good summary as well, just to give a big overview. I mean, we kind of already have given an overview, but let's do that because it's quite succinct. So on the back, good old back of a book, it's always useful to look at that. It says, after coming out as gay, Craig Hoyle was excommunicated from the New Zealand Exclusive Brethren and forced to say goodbye to his family forever. The conservative sect was everything he'd ever known, a childhood where television, pop music, sports and even pets were against the rules.

 [Joining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=978s) public society, the worldlies, for the first time, Craig sets out to meet his grandfather who had been excommunicated in the 1980s and then using his diaries and letters uncovers two centuries and seven generations of his family's tangled and often cruel relationship with the Exclusive Brethren or the Brethren. Weaving their past with Craig's own upbringing in this secretive and oppressive religious group, Excommunicated charts the evolution [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1009s) the Exclusive Brethren in New Zealand and the heart-wrenching stories of a family torn apart.

So this is a summary of your book, but also on the inside cover, Craig, it gives a wee summary of who you are now, which I think is important as well. So it says on the front cover, inside of the front cover, Craig Hoyle grew up in Invercargill within the New Zealand Exclusive Brethren. Separated from public society, he attended Brethren-only schooling and worked in his family's tyre shop. After facing interrogations and conversion therapy for his sexuality, he [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1046s) excommunicated from the Brethren and lost his family in 2009\. Today, he is the Chief News Director for the Sunday Star Times in New Zealand. He has worked for newsrooms such as TV3 and Radio Live and behind the scenes on current affairs shows including 60 Minutes. He lives in Tamaki Makaurau, Aotearoa, which is Auckland, New Zealand. So Craig, that's a quick snapshot of who you are now. You're still the chief news director for the Sunday Star Times, [aren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1076s) you? So no doubt you're a busy man. That must be such an intense role. And yeah, you enjoy living in Auckland. And I understand you live just down the road, actually, from the main Brethren meeting hall, which is quite funny, really.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1092s)

Yes, I drive past it almost every day.

And I thought long and hard about moving to this part of Auckland and then I thought, bugger it, why should the Brethren determine where I lived?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1101s)

Exactly, good for you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1103s)

Yeah, so there you go, there's a wee bio, that's a wee snapshot of who, very brief snapshot of who Craig is now and of the book, so let's go ahead and unpack the book. Craig, do you want to start us with the prologue, which kind of sets the scene, doesn't it, and then begin looking at the chapters with us?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1122s)

Sounds good. What I'll do is I'll read a few pages out from each chapter as we go, and then we can chat about them. So the prologue is where the book begins, and it sets the scene, and it starts in Invercargill.

“Grandma Edith shook with wrenching sobs as we stood on her doorstep. It was only the second time I'd seen her cry. The first was when she'd received news of her mother's death. This was so much worse. I knew that after this goodbye, I would never see grandma again.

Edith had tried to keep it together when I arrived at her house that overcast Saturday afternoon. She was speaking with another Brethren woman at her doorstep, and I stood to one side as their conversation wrapped up. Grandma broke down as soon as we were alone. She wept as she said she wasn't allowed to welcome me into a neatly arranged home. She had been told I was about to be placed in the first stage of excommunication, which meant she had to sever contact. There would be no cup of tea, no biscuits and no loving conversation at her [kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1186s) table. Her soft woolen cardigan and curled white hair stood out sharply through my own tears. I told her I wasn't officially excommunicated yet and begged her for one last hug. Sobbing even harder, she threw her arms around me. This was the last time we'd embrace, the last time she would speak to me without fear of retribution from the church, and the last time I would listen to her hearing aid beep because I had my head in the wrong place as we hugged. Edith, my dad's mum, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1216s) heartbroken. She spoke of how the devil kept taking away her family, her grandfather, her parents, her husband and two of her children and now here I was, the first grandchild she would be forced to disown. How could the devil be so cruel? But it wasn't the devil who was forcing us apart. It was the Exclusive Brethren.”

“On that Saturday in Invercargill, a blustery city at the southernmost end of New Zealand's South Island, I walked away from a Brethren family history that spanned seven generations and almost two centuries. I was 19 and life in the church was all I had ever known. Like my parents and their parents and their parents before them, I had been born into a system that demanded loyalty and obedience. To walk away was an act of desperation but I knew it was the only way I could ever be true to myself.”

And that is where the book starts and sets the tone for how it continues.

And it was really important to me to start the book with a scene like that because I think for all of the discussions that we have now, what it really comes back to is that we've been ripped away from our families and for as much as we can, um, get over it, we'll learn to live with it, it's that the absolute cruelty of those separations that when we're very first ripped away from our family and that I think is the [deepest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1309s) trauma that that never leaves us.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1311s)

Yeah, I had an insider send me a message that was a couple weeks ago and it was, it came into the reading today, "The Brethren doesn't split up families, God does." Oh my gosh.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1327s)

Are you kidding me?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1328s)

It actually made me cry. Like it actually, I actually, I actually cried after I read it. And was this like, only because right, our families are still in there and if they're teaching this stuff, I mean, before it was, you know, it's just the way that they change their narrative to fit what they need, right?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1350s)

Yeah, that's so true. I was speaking with some people yesterday about the realities of spiritual abuse and religious trauma. And I was saying that it's psychological abuse and mental abuse and emotional abuse, but it's got this extra layer because it's done in the name of God. That the people who are doing it use the concepts of the divine or of the sacred text or the Bible to sanction it and to justify it and to even make it a good thing, which is exactly what you've [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1380s) described.

It's horrific, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1385s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1385s)

Okay, so that's the prologue, which, you know, and it goes on. It's got several more pages that explain a wee bit more, doesn't it? And that just is, that just is full on. And the prologue finishes by saying, um, my life as I knew it was over. And I think that's something that again, every former member of a high demand religious group or every former member of the Brethren absolutely knows that statement in the depths of their bones, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1415s) all of us have reached a point where my life as I knew it was over.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1420s)

Yeah, and it's such a bittersweet moment, isn't it? Just like watching these, these new, these people that are leaving now, right? Full families coming out. And it's such a bittersweet moment of knowing that you're gaining that freedom that you've always wanted, but then your heart is being ripped out because you're having to leave behind the family. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1442s)

Yeah, and you never get over that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1444s)

No, you don't.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1445s)

For as much as we, you know...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1447s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1448s)

You can, you can learn to live with it, but it never goes away. Um, so after the prologue, we move into chapter, chapter one, which goes through parts of my childhood. I'll start with the beginning of chapter one, and then there's a second bit that's sort of related that I'll skip through too quickly.

“During the summer of 1998, when I was eight years old, my five younger siblings and I clustered excitedly beside the kitchen bench as Aunty Sophie plugged a cassette player into the wall socket. It was a sunny afternoon and we'd been racing up and down on the flying fox Dad had built for us in the backyard. We were streaked with dirt and grime, keeping us all clean was a tall order, and I scuffed my toes across the scratched linoleum as a tape clunked into place. This was a big novelty. We [weren't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1500s) usually allowed to listen to music, and we didn't even own a cassette player. This one was borrowed from an older Brethren couple around the corner who used it to listen to recordings of church services. I wondered if they'd have loaned it to us if they'd known it would be used for playing music. According to mum, just this once we could bend the rules, but it was best we didn't tell anyone.”

“Sophie had found the tapes in a cupboard at home in Wellington and brought them with her on this visit to Invercargill, but she hadn't told me or my siblings what was on them. All we knew was that she and mum clearly thought they were important. To me, they were even more exciting than the flying fox. I was amazed that entire speeches and songs could be stored on thin strips of plastic film. Our lives were almost completely free of modern technology, so this was an eye-opening window to another world. As my auntie hit play, the [tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1551s) clicked and whirred. A hush fell over the kitchen. Then a soulful melody began, like nothing I'd ever heard. The notes of an instrument swooped through the song. Mum and Sophie explained it was a Hawaiian guitar with a small seal bar used to pluck out the gliding sounds much loved on the islands. I closed my eyes and imagined a tropical beach with palm trees and scorched white sand. And then an astonishing revelation. The person playing these otherworldly songs, Mum said, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1582s) her own mother, Grandma Lottie.

I stared in shock. Lottie was deeply religious, even by Brethren standards, and I couldn't fathom her being behind something so beautiful and exotic. Sophie explained that Lottie had a complicated relationship with her beloved guitar. Although she loved playing it, she worried her music was coming between her and God. At one point, she feared her guitar was becoming an idol and stopped playing it for years. In the cassette recordings, she wasn't performing [alone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1612s) A man whose voice I didn't recognise was playing the piano alongside her, their voices raised together in song. Her accompanist sang in a rich baritone and their harmonies tugged at the heartstrings. A faraway look crossed my mother's face. Our auntie warned we needed to be careful that Grandma Lottie didn't hear the recordings. They'll make her cry.”

And the subtext becomes clear later in that chapter is the recordings of my grandparents playing together and my grandpa had been withdrawn from. And so we weren't to let grandma listen to those recordings, because if she heard her and grandpa playing together, it was too much of a reminder of what had been lost.

And just picking up on that music theme a few pages on, describing...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1671s)

That actually makes me feel so sad because you know they were, I obviously didn't know your grandmother so much, but they like, this is about George, yeah, or if it's okay to give that away. But yeah, he, like he was an amazing musician and he loved to sing and he had a wonderful voice and yeah, that just makes me feel so sad to think that there's this recording, this snapshot of a couple together sharing their [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1701s) love of music together and you know, there's a recording of this moment and then, yeah, all that like pain and division and separation to come to, you know, to never sing and play together ever again. Um, it's a heartbreaking picture. No wonder they didn't ever want your grandma to listen to them because it would have been just so painful for her to remember that togetherness and beauty that they did have.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1729s)

And just on that togetherness, I think that segues nicely to this next bit, which is just short.

“Mum had a honey-coloured guitar and would sing us to sleep after we'd been tucked in. This was pretty much the only time we heard her play. She was usually too busy in the kitchen to get her guitar out at Brethren social gatherings. One of the songs she strummed was Hank Thompson's 1956 country ballad, The Blackboard of My Heart. The chorus mystified me when I first heard it. The singer talks about his heart as though it's a blackboard that once had I love you written on it. Now his tears have washed the words away and it's too late for him [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1767s) write them there again. At the end of the song, Mum stopped to answer my questions about blackboards and explained how chalk could be dusted away. She leaned across for a reassuring hug and told me, "The words I love you are written on the blackboard of my heart with permanent marker and can't ever be removed."

And I think that speaks for itself. And this was a, there was so much love in our family and so many things that were messed up as well. But there was this outpouring of love from people like my mum and people like my grandma, so much love to give, and a lot of it was expressed through music like this.

And it wasn't until I became older that I realised there were these incredibly dark undercurrents through it all.

And we'll just carry on to the end of chapter one, I think, which ties those pieces together.

“As I grew older, I started to connect the dots. The man we'd heard in Grandma Lottie's recordings was the mysterious George to whom I had been compared as a child whenever I was being rebellious. I learned that he had been Lottie's husband, which made him my grandpa. He was Anna's younger brother. Anna is Lindy's nana. George had been withdrawn from when my mum was 13 and she hadn't seen him since. This explained why Lottie lived without a husband and might cry if she heard the recordings. [Even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1872s) worse, George was against the Brethren, one of the terrible opposers we kept hearing about. He had dared to challenge the Elect Vessel's authority. We were told he had hurt Lottie deeply and abandoned the family. George loomed in the distance as an evil person who shouldn't be talked about. A story that made threats of excommunication seem very real. I imagined what might happen if I met a similar fate. Be careful what you say, I told myself, or you might end up like George.”

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1904s)

Yeah.

Yeah, that's an interesting reflection there that you've captured that you were aware of thinking even as a young age because, um, yeah, one of the things that I've learned a lot about in therapy, especially over the last few years is around concepts of attachment. And, um, and in families, you know, how do you have secure attachment and anxious attachment and avoidant attachment and all that sort of thing that in this, this knowledge that it's so important for us to know that we have, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1936s) loving bonds with people we can trust around us. 

And you know, that story of your mum saying to you, you know, I've written "I love you" on the blackboard of your heart and that can't ever be erased, that was a beautiful description of a mother, you know, trying to affirm to you that her, she was going to be there for you no matter what. Like what a precious memory that was. And yet at the same time, you know, at the end of the chapter there, you're reflecting this growing awareness as you grow up that actually sometimes people do [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=1966s) scrubbed off from the blackboard and that they disappear. And, and that is also this weird reality as you've said, there's this beautiful love and bond and at the same time, this awareness that we all grew up with knowing that sometimes people disappeared. And that if you were naughty in some way or stepped out of line and, and like you said, you're never too sure what it really was about because often we weren't told what people had done, but we just knew that they had disappeared.

It's an awful reality of what it's like growing up in the Brethren, starting to learn these factors.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2005s)

You're being promised unconditional love and then at the same time realizing unspoken that there actually are all these conditions. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2014s)

Yeah, and it's just, it's, it's, I think our mothers and our parents have very, very good intentions, right? But with how heavily indoctrinated everybody is, we do, we do become a death to them. We become completely written out of their lives. And I think due to the indoctrination that they're all under, that really does, that really happens in their brain, right? We're not spoken about. I mean, when Richard [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2044s) met me, he had no clue I even existed in my family and he had stayed with my family. You know, I had somebody else reach out and say that, no, there's no, there's no Cheryl that was ever here in Maple Creek, that this isn't true. There's no Cheryl. I mean, she wasn't from the locality of Maple Creek. So it's, it's one of those things where you sit back and it's heart wrenching what you've got to, especially a mother who gives birth to a child and then eventually has [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2074s) allow the memories and the interactions that all of the things that they gave to that child literally die within their soul. It's so sad. Like I mean, we go through what we go through, but just imagine what our parents must go through as well.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2093s)

Yeah, and especially for a lot of us who chose to leave. I mean, we had an element of choice and we can at least, we, I know for myself, I can live with the, um, consequences of those choices because I knew and still believe that it was the right thing for me. Yeah, um, but I look at someone like my mother who had no choice, you know, all of the separation, all of this heartbreak has been really, as I said, forced on her. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2123s) when you don't have that choice, it's a lot harder to live with the consequences. Yeah. And so I think moving, moving on to the next chapter. And the, the sad thing here is that there's, um, there can be a lot of love in Brethren families and they can also be a lot that's not so great. And this is what chapter two starts to deal with.

“Watching dad as I grew up taught me that violence was how some things got dealt with. He thrashed me and I lashed out at my younger siblings. A horrible cycle where punching and kicking was the ultimate demonstration of anger. One afternoon when I was only eight, a petty sibling dispute boiled over soon after dad got home from work. Angered by his heavy-handed attempts at justice, I screamed at him. "Fuck\!" I had never sworn in front of Dad before. Swearing was a terrible yet exotic [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2185s) done by worldly kids, and I thought this word was the worst of them all. 

From the look on his face, it was as though the ground had parted for the arrival of the devil himself. I realised I'd made a grave error and hightailed it for the backyard with Dad, still in his work overalls, in close pursuit. I made it as far as the washing line before I tripped and fell. He closed in. I was used to being severely smacked, but this was different. Dad left me lying on the ground and lined up his steel-capped boots. [Thud.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2215s) Thud. Thud. I wrapped my arms around my head, sobbing and screaming as his kicks thumped into me. Later, bruised and terrified, I curled up in Mum's arms, crying as she tried to tell me that everything would be okay.

Not long after that, a couple of Brethren kids came round for a playdate. Childish roughhousing turned to name-calling, and I ran off and shut myself in my room. But Victor and Blake wouldn't let me get away so easily. They banged on the bedroom door, shouting taunts. Full of rage and with nowhere further to run, I opened the door, punched Victor in the face, and slammed it closed. I'd broken Victor's nose. There was no hiding what I'd done when he turned up at church in a face cast. Everyone saw me as a violent child and I was marched around [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2262s) his family home for a humiliating apology while our mothers made awkward small talk, pretended there was no bad blood. Nobody thought to ask what was going on in our home. It was just a black mark against my name, one that lingered for years.

One of the many problems with beating your kids is that eventually they get big enough to defend themselves. As the oldest child, I was the first to put this to the test with Dad. He was slender and wiry, and at ten I was solidly built enough to try my luck. Dad had chased me into my bedroom for a beating and was incensed when I dared strike back with a punch. Standing up to him was like dumping a jerry can of petrol onto a bonfire. Blows rained down indiscriminately, and in the scuffle we fell to the floor where we writhed around [throwing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2308s) punches. I wasn't quite big enough to match his strength, so I grabbed his pinky and bent it back as far as I could. In the heat of the moment, I figured breaking his finger was the only way this nightmare would stop.

 "David, stop\!" Eventually, mum's helpless screaming got through to dad. Ashen-faced and panting, he rolled off to one side and looked at me in disgust. "We're going to have to call a priest." To me, this was the worst possible outcome. The intervention of a priest was the first step [towards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2338s) someone being shut up or withdrawn from. I was still under the nominal age of 12 for assembly responsibility as it was known, but feared that wouldn't be enough to save me from public punishment. 

My fear of dad was eclipsed only by my fear of being excommunicated and I sobbed in terror as he went to find the phone. I would be the one in trouble. He was the head of the household, so I was supposed to respect his authority no matter what. "Please don't," I said. "I'll be good, I promise." [When](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2369s) my tearful pleas fell on deaf ears, I ran sobbing into the night. Brethren discipline required a priest to first talk to the guilty party. Using my childhood logic, I figured that if he couldn't talk to me, I couldn't be shut up. I huddled, terrified, in a neighborhood alley in the dark, weeping as my mind churned through worst-case outcomes. How would I face the other Brethren kids at school if I was shut up?

Eventually I plucked up the courage to creep back through the streets and surveyed the family home. The coast appeared to be clear so I snuck through the back door and put myself to bed. The next day mum told me it didn't look like I was going to be shut up but she added that I needed to be a better boy. For weeks I lived in fear that priests might change their minds.

So this section was really important to me to include because I think it illustrates how messed up a lot of Brethren families can be and it's not talked about.

Whether it is violence or whether it's sexual abuse or any of these really, really traumatic experiences that children might be having. So often they were swept under the rug or the blame was pushed back onto the children. And all of the times where I was accused of being a violent child, no one ever, ever asked what was going on in our family. No one ever asked me [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2462s) I thought violence was an okay way to deal with a situation. And when the violence was discussed, it was only my violence that was the problem because I was challenging the head of the household. His violence to us was fine according to the priests.

Um, and so this was the the undercurrent to a childhood in the Brethren, I think, because yes, there was this love and this warmth and being surrounded by people that you cared about. And there was also this really, really ugly side that wasn't talked about and that really fucked you up if we're being honest. And I think a lot of [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2512s) are still living with that impact now.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2515s)

Yeah, yeah, that's that's so true, Craig. That, um, yeah, Brethren Brethren homes for all their lovely, you know, these days anyway, manicured gardens and their neat and tidy appearances and tidy clothes and all that kind of thing. They, Brethren homes are full of very similar types of dysfunction as can be found anywhere else. And some of it's yeah, physical violence, some of it's sexual violence, alcohol abuse, drug abuse. Um, there's also huge amounts [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2545s) mental and emotional and psychological abuse and control and dysfunction going on and marriages and families. Enormous amounts of it that when you all sit together in rows in church, you you don't see anything of it. And yeah, it's important to name that. It's important.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2563s)

And to also just, could you imagine like having an eight-year-old kid who's been acting out or to have someone come up to him and just say, like, are you okay? Like, how are you doing? That was never asked. That was just, that wasn't something that was sat down with and you sincerely asked somebody or a teenager that's acting out. Those, those are not words that ever would come out. And if they did come out, it always had this gaslighting element to [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2593s) that was fear based. It wasn't a sincere heart-to-heart conversation of like, what really is going on?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2601s)

Yeah, don't ask, don't tell is a huge sub-cultural motto of, yeah, the Brethren.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2610s)

You know, just following on from that and that whole don't ask, don't tell in the way that nobody ever asked and nobody ever, you know, we just swept it all under the rug. There's another few pages towards the end of the same chapter that I think flow on from this quite well.

And a bit of context to this is that my dad struggled with depression through my whole childhood, so it was not an easy thing to be around.

When I was 16 and in year 12, mum spent weeks in hospital after surgery to remove her gallbladder. She'd been having issues with gallstones and it all finally came to a head. I was struggling at school, acting out and talking back to the teachers, then driving to the hospital after class to pour my heart out to mum. She lay pallid and grey in a surgical ward yet still gave everything she could to make sure he was supported. Was she afraid of dying? No. If she was going to die, did she want us to call her [dad?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2672s) George. No. I loved mum dearly and couldn't wrap my head around how she expressed little affection for her dad, though at one point she'd loved just as much as us kids loved her. My six siblings and I needed our own dad to step up and make sure we were okay, but as mum lay in hospital, he spiralled even deeper into his depression. One awful morning, he drove himself to exhaustion and collapsed again. This time, he crumpled in the kitchen, cracking his head open on the bench as he fell. My brother Caleb found [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2702s) lying on the floor in a pool of blood, and once again, we had to call an ambulance for him. But this felt worse than his previous episodes. He'd never needed to be stitched up before, and now mum wasn't there to pick up pieces.

Later that day, as dad was treated at hospital, we heard that mum was being rushed into emergency surgery again. There had been problems post-op, and her abdomen needed to be reopened immediately. The doctors said they couldn't guarantee she'd survived. I went through the day feeling numb, waiting for a phone call to let me know whether I still had a mum, and for that matter a dad. What's a teenager supposed to do in a situation like that? How do you prepare for the possibility of becoming the eldest of seven orphans? My [teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2745s) were as kind as they could be but I couldn't properly open up to them about my trauma and grief because as wellies, I felt they wouldn't understand. When mum came home from hospital she was bedridden, too weak to do anything more than watch his dad's mental health continue to deteriorate. He shut himself in his wardrobe for days at a time, obsessing over books of Brethren teachings as he cried in the dark for God to show him the way forward. Occasionally he'd emerge and shouted us for not being well behaved.

One evening he became very upset about us not eating dinner together as a family. It was difficult to get nine people showered, dressed and fed simultaneously before the 7:30 church service. He demanded we all arrive at the table at the same time. We made it happen, no mean feat, and sat there expectantly, waiting for him to read the usual pre-dinner Bible verses. Instead, he stared at us blankly, then slammed the Bible down and shouted, "I can't do this." As he stormed back to the wardrobe, the rest [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2806s) us ate in stunned silence.

 I was in an impossible situation. According to Brethren doctrine, Dad was still the head of the house, and we had to respect his authority, even if he was no longer capable of exercising it. I couldn't understand where he was coming from or what he was trying to achieve. I was a headstrong teenager with issues of my own, years away from any empathy for the huge pain he lived with. I resented him for traumatising us and for his double standards. If I lashed out, the priests got called, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2836s) if Dad lashed out, we had to submit to his authority. 

Dad became suicidal and talked about wanting to end his life. I remember at least one occasion when he disappeared into the night and Mum was distraught. We had no idea where he was, had he hung himself in the cemetery, drowned in the river or jumped in front of a train. As the eldest son, I was supposed to shoulder responsibility, so I took it upon myself to comb the streets of Invercargill, pushing aside a rising lump in my throat as I scanned parks and beaches for my father's body. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2867s) felt very alone on that late night mission. The severity of Dad's depression was brushed over by the Brethren and nobody offered to help me with the search.

Um, and that I think, um, circles back around to what we're talking about, about the, um, utter lack of support, um, for people who are struggling with their mental health in the Brethren, um, and more broadly, how a lot of those mental health struggles were caused by the Brethren in the first place.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2902s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely brutal. And yeah, and very, very graphic, very, yeah, very beautiful, beautifully described but graphic scenarios that I'm sure many listeners will identify with moments of observing family members in complete crisis and feeling completely alone because, you know, you were alone. Um, knowing the [Brethren,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2932s) however well-meaning, um, some, you know, run-of-the-mill Brethren person, um, couldn't help or didn't know so they couldn't help, even just with acts of kindness like bringing around a meal. Um, the priests and elders can't help. 

So much of this stuff's totally out of their, yeah, for sure. I remember, um, a family member of mine being in complete crisis including with mental health issues and the, and the, the priests being counselled and being told that, um, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2962s) person needed to read the bible more, which, you know, but like your dad in that moment, um, that you described at the family dinner table, this person was incapable of doing that at that time because their mental distress was so great and that was not what at all what they needed to be told to do. Um, and then, you know, we, like you said, we didn't feel that we could talk to teachers, they were outsiders and not to be trusted. When you're a kid, you can't take yourself off to the doctor or even a [teenager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2992s) and you'd be scared to trust the doctor. Like, where do you go?

It's incredibly lonely.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=2999s)

And none of these, like none of these things that I'm describing here had anything to do with me questioning the Brethren. They were just desperate situations that we needed help with. Yeah. Um, and the Brethren just weren't there. Yeah. Um, and I mean, later in that chapter, I go on to describe, um, you know, I ended up talking to Athol Greene of all people about this. And of course, he's, and BDH's father-in-law [now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3029s) died. But Athol Greene was a nice guy. And, but his advice was that I needed to step up and take responsibility for the family and responsibility for the family business and responsibility for my six younger siblings. And that I should be a father to my parents because both my grandfathers had been withdrawn from. And, um, and I was only 16\.

And this whole idea...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3057s)

Yeah, like the logic that happens inside a high demand religious group, right? It's so unrealistic.

Just, that's the hard part of all this. And we see this now that we're out and we, we hear what happens inside there and they just, they don't understand what reality really is. Meanwhile, reality is happening inside there, right? I mean, your dad would have just needed someone to sit down with so that he could pour his heart out to them on whatever it was that was bugging him, but that would have never been offered. I mean, I can't remember of a time when I was ever in there where there was ever a moment offered to me to feel safe [enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3097s) to be able to come clean with what had happened to me, you know? Those, those moments don't happen.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3103s)

And I think one of the things that looking back was really harmful was this whole idea of, um, God only gives you as much as you can handle. And, and the more that's getting piled on you is so, that's just the reflection that God has, God believes that you can deal with this. So the worse it is, the more God believes in you. And therefore, sort of by extension, if you failed to rise to the challenge of all of this trauma [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3133s) was being piled on you, it meant that you were failing what God believed you were capable of.

And it just meant that you were never able to stand up and say, this is too much, this isn't okay.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3148s)

Yeah, yeah. It's like the bar is held here, here is the bar. Everybody must achieve the bar no matter what weights are strapped to your back. And if you can't, well, we'll kind of look the other way because we don't know what to do. And you just, yeah, you need to, 16-year-old Craig, you just need to like man up and parent your parents and the business and all of your siblings. Like, yeah, it's yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3174s)

And if it all looks like it's sort of rising much too rapidly, well then that clearly means that God thinks the bar should be higher.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3185s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3188s)

So I think that for me it was a complicated childhood. A lot of love and also a lot of pain. And very, very fortunate that there wasn't heavy drinking by either of my parents, I'm glad on that front, and also glad that there was no sexual abuse within our family. And for as much as these terrible things happened in our family, I recognise that being protected from those things was a really fortunate thing in a Brethren childhood.

So the book, at this point, two chapters in, goes in a different direction that starts going back to the history, describing so Lindy and I, our great-great-great-great grandfather Sam Childs, knew the Darby and Wigram families back in England, back around London, and have actually known those families since before the Brethren times and so when the Brethren came along it was a natural fit.

And I'll just read a section about Sam Childs.

“Samuel Childs, my great-great-great-great grandfather, was a well-to-do businessman from London's merchant class. Born out of wedlock in 1787, Sam was an impressive figure with wavy black hair and thick dark eyebrows, exuding confidence in a gilt-framed oil painting he sat for in his late 40s. But for all his material success, he was a troubled man, preoccupied with whether God would judge him for the circumstances of his birth. His unease with his place in Christendom dovetailed with growing [religious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3304s) dissatisfaction in Britain and Ireland.

Some Anglicans felt the Church of England had become stale, heading down the same liturgical path as Roman Catholicism. These protesters rejected the concept of organized religion in favor of a simpler ascetic faith, and they gathered for informal meetings inspired by, as they saw it, the Bible alone. Tormented as he was by church teachings on parenthood and legitimacy, Sam must have been relieved to find a community of Christians who had thrown out the old rulebook. Through the [1820s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3335s) and into the 1830s, these free thinkers loosely coalesced, among them John Nelson Darby, the youngest son of the Darbys of Leap Castle.

With his privilege, charisma and piercing dark eyes, he stood out as a prominent voice. Fellow Brethren founder George Vicesimus Wigram was a family friend of Sam Childs. Darby and Wigram's group soon came to be known as the Plymouth Brethren in recognition of the rebels' early connections to Plymouth, a port city on the south coast of Devon. The Brethren movement spread rapidly and [sometime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3365s) after 1841 Sam moved with his wife and the youngest of their 13 children to the Berkshire town of Reading in the Thames Valley.

A Brethren meeting room had been established there in 1840, the Blue Room on Queen's Road, and Darby was a frequent visitor. Even in those early days, trouble was brewing within the group. Brethren followers argued over how to interpret and apply scripture, and a loose set of rules began to take shape. In 1836, the year Sam's last of four sons was born, a [prominent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3395s) Brethren member was concerned enough to pen a letter to Darby warning that if the group continued on its path, it would be consumed by doctrine and opinion. Darby, whose mysticism had taken a moody turn after he fell from his horse and suffered a head injury, paid the warning no heed.

Tensions erupted in 1848 as the Brethren movement underwent its first bitter split. A comparatively liberal side believed it was acceptable to continue fellowship with other Christians who held slightly different beliefs, and this side became known as Open Brethren. The Darby and Wigram camp, meanwhile, believed in rigid enforcement of doctrinal boundaries and became known as Exclusive Brethren. Brethren gatherings up and down England were forced to choose sides, with friends and relatives cleaving over who was correct. This divide [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3442s) the retired Sam Childs in a difficult spot.

The 61-year-old had relocated to Reading, only for much of the congregation there to turn against his long-time friends, Darby and Wigram by establishing an open brethren meeting. For Sam, a gruff grandfather with bushy white whiskers, there was no question about where his allegiance lay. By 1853 he had given up on Reading and moved his household back closer to London. There he set about constructing a home in Sunbury on land adjacent to Darby House, an estate owned by the family of the [emerging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3473s) Brethren leader. This was much more comfortable territory.”

And the reason I included this in the and the reason I read it out now is because it was really important to me to demonstrate that this separation and this difficulty and this trauma that we're experiencing is not new. This didn't just start in 1960 when separation came in, this was happening to Lindy and I's great-great-great-great grandfather [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3508s) the 1850s, where it turns out you're suddenly living in the wrong city to be part of the Brethren that you're a part of, and it ends up being more comfortable to relocate your entire family so that you can be in the right place with the right Brethren.

And this is, I think, something that a lot of people don't quite understand. I think there is a bit of, there's a bit of sort of rose-tinted reflection on the fact that the Brethren was so much better before 1960 and in my opinion and certainly from everything that we've gathered from going through 200 years of our family records is they really weren't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3559s)

Yeah, I agree with that. There was, it was just recently, there was a bunch of stuff put out about JND. And I was talking to another ex-member about how we should probably do a podcast on it. Because our, I think a lot of us have this perception exactly before 1960, that this stuff didn't exist. Right. And then I started reading through a lot of these papers, and I was just mind blown at the complications and the thought, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3590s) the way that John Nelson Darby actually did communicate his teachings and it was, it's very similar to what we have now. It was just, that's just done in a different, different context, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3605s)

Yeah, that that's completely right. There are so many accounts of nothing to do with the PBCC now, the Exclusive Brethren, other Brethren scholars, Brethren historians of the wider Brethren movement or of other religious scholars of just other wider religious scene who have got archival letters and documents and newspaper clippings and things like that that describe [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3635s) controversial JN Darby was. And you know, he's described by these other people as being a polarizing figure, being a person who divided communities with his, it wasn't just his beliefs and his doctrine, although it was definitely those were, you know, outworking, but it was his character as well. He was a, he was a polarizing character. Yes, he was obviously intelligent and charismatic in some areas, but he was controlling and ruthless and black and white. And those [sorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3665s) of characteristics came through in his theology and his doctrine and his teaching, and they marked every Christian assembly that took leadership from him.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3677s)

Yeah, and that then ended up having a massive impact on the Brethren in New Zealand, because the Brethren in New Zealand were started by J.G. Deck, who had been friends with Darby back in England and then came out to New Zealand. He didn't agree with the separation between open and exclusive brethren, and so he came out to New Zealand.

Actually, we'll just read this bit from the book.

### 

It'll be faster than me trying to explain it.

So the context here is we're down another generation now. My great-great-great-grandparents had been missionaries to Jamaica and had helped start the Brethren movement there.

Then they were back in England and then after the death of one of their children.

“As he mourned his lost son, my great-great-great-grandfather threw himself into Brethren affairs back in the thick of things with Darby and Wigram in England. Disturbing reports were emerging as a wayward direction taken by the fledgling Brethren movement in New Zealand, a far-flung colony in the South Pacific where only a few decades earlier the Crown had signed a treaty with Maori tribes. Darby's friend and Brethren associate James Deck had shipped out there some 20 years prior, ostensibly for his health, although letters show he was deeply pained about the split [between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3758s) Brethren followers in 1848, and perhaps saw the new colony as an escape.

Free from the watchful oversight of Darby and Wigram, Deck had set about establishing his own version of brethrenism. A charismatic preacher with a long-flowing beard, he drew large numbers from mainstream Christian churches whose leaders saw him as a threat to their congregations. Deck welcomed all, never bothering to draw a distinction between open and exclusive brethren.

This worked fine for 20 years, but as shipping routes and communication improved, word filtered back to England of the freewheeling nature of his movement. Darby and Wigram grew increasingly concerned with setting New Zealand straight. In 1871, Wigram journeyed to the colony and undertook an extensive tour, trying to determine which Brethren meetings should be classified as exclusive and which open. He reported approvingly that the assembly in Christchurch appeared to have the greatest loyalty to the exclusive side, but he [remained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3815s) concerned overall by the lax approach taken by the New Zealand Brethren.

On a subsequent visit in 1874 he fretted that the assemblies were being tainted by the heartiness and rough and ready nature of the society. It's little wonder then that Wigram and Darby sought to install loyalists among the exclusive residents of New Zealand. They needed devotees who would preach the correct strict doctrine and pressure other members to toe the line. This was the perfect opening for William Childs, that's our great-great-great [grandfather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3846s), a proven loyalist with connections from childhood who had shown he was willing to depart for distant shores in support of the Brethren cause.”

And this really illustrates the turmoil that was going on in the Brethren, and particularly in New Zealand through the 1870s, where Wigram literally came to New Zealand and travelled around all of these different Brethren meetings and essentially drew up lists and said, well, you're good Brethren, we'll consider you to be exclusives, and you're not good, we'll consider [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3885s) to be open Brethren, and basically split all of these different churches and demanded that the ones that they considered to be exclusive stop talking to all the ones that he considered to be open Brethren.

And so there's this massive separation and turmoil and trauma that ran through this Brethren movement in the 1870s in New Zealand, as Wigram and Darby controlling things from England and then on a subsequent visit were [demanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3920s) this loyalty and demanding this adherence to this division that they were insisting on. And again, separation, this was not a new concept. The idea of separation at some level had been there from the very beginning and this is what Wigram and Darby were demanding of the New Zealand Brethren in the 1870s was separation between open and exclusive, which was something that Deck didn't agree with [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3951s) in the end was forced to go along with.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3952s)

Yeah, yeah. It's just so interesting to sit back, right, and just listen to the words that are all being used and it's fast forward to 2024\.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3963s)

There's nothing new about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3966s)

No, yeah. There's just different, different world, right, with different control, with different tools that they're using, right? It's just, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=3977s)

And you know, you've obviously been born and raised in New Zealand, so you're describing the New Zealand Brethren historical scene there too, but it must be the same for every country around the world where the Brethren are as well. There's these tales of families and power and politics and strong leaders bashing heads against each other and the outfall of that on individual lives and on family relationships.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4007s)

Just on the impact on individual lives, and coming down another generation, skipping through to the 1890s, this is our great-great-grandfather Fred.

“As I sift through our family records, I discover a letter to Fred from his sister-in-law Sophia four months after his wedding in 1898\. Writing from England with loopy blue penmanship, she references the family's sadness that Fred's eldest brother has drifted from the fold. "Poor Will, we must go on praying for him. He is missing so much." Sophia praises Frederick Raven's simple teaching and consistent preaching, although there's a hint that not all is rosy among his followers. "How sad it is that he, [Raven,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4050s) has been so misunderstood."

To me, this is familiar language. More than a century later, I was taught as a child that most people who oppose the Brethren just don't understand them. The supposed misunderstandings of Raven's doctrines prompted further divides through the last two decades of the 19th century as members left in protest. In 1890, Fred's missionary father was among a group at the Worcester Street Hall who rejected Raven's teachings, leading to a split in the Christchurch Assembly. But Fred, now [married](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4080s) into a family of Raven loyalists, stayed true to the Exclusive Brethren cause.”

And so we just see by this point we're on to the third generation of the family that's experiencing turmoil over what's going on in the Brethren. And there's these splits and these separations and these demands for loyalty. And you see family members that aren't part of that, the ones that have started to go off and do their own thing, are starting to be [frozen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4112s) out. And maybe contact isn't being cut off with them, but they're starting to be referred to in a different way. Sort of you pity them, you feel sorry for them. It's clear that there's something a bit wrong with them because they're not performing to the same level of Brethrenism as you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4131s)

Yeah. Later on towards the end of your chapter, the same guy, Fred, so that's your great-grandpa, right? Just to reiterate that.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4138s)

Our great-great-grandpa, I guess.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4140s)

Yeah, yeah. So towards the end of this chapter, you describe a bit later on in Fred's life and again, a fascinating letter that you or a pamphlet that you got hold of, a historical one. Not sure of the exact year that it, doesn't say the year that it was written, but again, it's so amazing that you've got these historical documents. But you describe that a London elder wrote a pamphlet and wrote it and Fred [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4170s) would have received this pamphlet along with many others.

But in it, this man called Mr. Giles, or Giles, I don't know how you say that, sorry, he warned about the Exclusive Brethren and said that under Taylor's leadership they, the Brethren, were at risk of becoming, quote, "a vast hierarchical system dominated by Taylor to the exclusion of any who cannot agree with him," unquote. And our great-great-grandpa agreed [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4200s) this pamphlet along with many others. And many people, you know, so-called in Brethren speak, turned away from Mr. Taylor at that point, or set up a rival table and, and you know, all those kinds of divisions that happened over the years.

And that was the language that was used for, yeah, it was. And and those who were still Exclusive Brethren, of course, had the view that we are the faithful ones, we're the remnant, we're holding on to the core truth, whereas in everybody [else's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4230s) perspective, they were, you know, barking completely up the tree and that this profound exclusivism and polarization was actually very problematic and not in line with Christian doctrine and theology. So it's like...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4246s)

It's just chaos.

For 200 years, very regularly, there has reached a point where a whole lot of people in the Brethren have gone, like, this is a step too far, it's time to get off the crazy train.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4262s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4263s)

Yeah, yeah. And so, like, this is for the people, especially for the insiders that are listening to this now, if you're reaching this point where you can't, you don't believe in it and it doesn't make sense and you think it's time to take a step back and then you say, "But how can you walk away on 200 years of the testimony?" And so it's, it's not like every step of the way for 200 years people have been saying this has [gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4293s) too far, this is not okay, it's time to take a step back and walk away. And like, you are just the latest in a long, long pattern of people raising the alarm.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4304s)

Yeah, of thousands of people raising the alarm and thousands of people doing the same thing. You're not alone, you're not crazy, you're not, yeah, you're not, you know, on a flight of fantasy. It just might be that actually you're the one who's seeing things really clearly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4319s)

And it's just not talked about, right? Like that's the thing in there. The most that they have to glean any kind of hope of change is Aberdeen, right? I don't know how, I talk to so many insiders that are all waiting for an Aberdeen moment. They, they, they're waiting for this Aberdeen door to happen because then it's an easy walk out the door, right? And so I mean, this is so good the way that you laid it out in here is because it really shows those inside that it wasn't just about [Aberdeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4349s), right? Like for 200 years this door has been swaying back and forth. It gets really full inside it and it opens up.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4357s)

And by the, again, by the time this happened in 1920 with the Giles division, it had been going on for 100 years already. There was already four generations of our family that had been pushed and pulled and torn in different directions by what was happening with the Brethren. And so, you know, 1920 for us is more than 100 years ago now. But for the people living that Brethren experience then, it had been going on for 100 years before that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4384s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4385s)

And so the idea that any of us are just going to be able to decondition without doing some really deep work is unlikely or difficult.

So moving on through the book, that's taken us to the end of chapter three. And then chapter four moves forward a bit in time.

“My great-grandmother Ruth came out of the Brethren in 1920 with the rest of the family, and so she had had a childhood in the Exclusive Brethren, and then the family went to the Open Brethren after they left in the Giles division.

They ended up meeting our great-grandfather Alf, who was also in the Open Brethren at that point. He had grown up in the Exclusive Brethren like her, and then had decided to break bread with the Opens instead. And he was through the 1930s on the Chatham Islands working at the radio station there.

And at this point, Alf and Ruth weren't officially together, but they were doing a lot of writing back and forth in the 1930s. And so that's where the story picks up.

Alf and Ruth's shared exclusive heritage was a mixed blessing. His parents were still in the more restrictive church, as were many of Ruth's uncles and aunts, and the couple faced ongoing pressure to return to the fold. When Ruth travelled to Ashhurst in the summer of 1933 to visit relatives, she was interrogated by three elders about why she had deserted the church of her childhood. Alf was indignant. ‘My dear Ruth, what a battery you ran,’ and adamant he too would never return to a church that he saw as a pretty [dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4489s) bunch.

Besides, he added, even if he and Ruth were to be recognized as exclusives again, they would be promptly excommunicated for sharing communion with outsider Christians. ‘If your dear dad came over and broke bread, we would be cut off, I suppose.’”

And this is just to demonstrate the very strong them and us that was happening even then in the 1930s, which was still decades before official separation.

And Alf and Ruth ended up married in World War II. They were in Palmerston North. Alf was in the Air Force at Milson Aerodrome there.

“But Exclusive Brethren shadows were never far away. Alf's wartime stint in Palmerston North put the family within reach of their exclusive relatives including Alf's father, Ernie, and stepmother, Kate, in nearby Ashhurst. Alf and Ruth had mostly cordial relationships with these relatives as contact between members and non-members was still permitted by the exclusives. It bugged Ruth that she and Alf still faced occasional pressure to return. In the summer of 1945, she described how her father-in-law had paid them a visit [accompanied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4560s) by an exclusive elder who recommended us to try them for a month.

A few weeks later, Ruth visited an exclusive friend and was surprised when another exclusive woman arrived and pinned her in conversation. "Ida talked meeting and justified their right position and didn't I want to go back?" It was a relief when the host emerged from the kitchen with afternoon tea.”

And I include that just to demonstrate the pressure that was happening on people even back then. And we have this now with people who come out of the Brethren and there's this massive pressure to change your mind or to go back, and this undermining of the path that you have chosen because you can't possibly be right.

And just to make the point here, Alf and Ruth were not in any way inclined to go back to the Exclusive Brethren, but they were trying to have cordial relationships with people who were still in the Exclusive Brethren. And so the result of that was there was this constant pressure that they faced, this constant challenging of their choices, this pressure to go back to the true position, the right [position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4636s) to be part of the one true fellowship.

And I think there's a lot in there that a lot of people today will relate to. There's nothing new. This has been going on for a long time. This was our great-grandparents when they were about our age.

And what ended up happening was that our great-grandpa Alf developed cancer, and the cancer was the leverage that the Brethren needed to pull them back.

He was weak and vulnerable, he couldn't work for extended periods of time, and the Exclusive Brethren in Wellington, which is where they were at this point, sort of poured love and support and money at their family. And probably the money is the most important thing, and there was this sort of wrap-around support that the Exclusive Brethren do so well, and that was the tipping point for our great-grandpa Alf to go back [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4702s) the church with cancer. And so this was a hugely difficult thing.

“So Alf had gone back into the church already, but Ruth was much harder to persuade, resolutely staying home, even when Alf started taking the children along to the services. But the pressure ratcheted up as her husband started attending meetings every Sunday and then on weeknights as well. Even so, Ruth was bewildered when he told her in the summer of 1949 that he had decided to return as a member. They'd just been on a romantic getaway to the Marlborough Sounds without the children, a blissful two weeks of swimming, picnicking and napping during which Alf had said [nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4749s) about his intentions.

His wife spent the next six weeks in torment, describing her daily grief and despair over Alf's return to the dogmatic church of their youth. ‘I Grieved as if Alf has taken a step, I feel I cannot. Why?’ The couple spent long nights by the fire debating Exclusive Brethren beliefs well past midnight as their children slept. Ruth penned a long letter to her father Fred, now in his 70s, knowing he would understand her concerns. But she showed [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4779s) letter to Alf, then had a change of heart and ripped it up.

12 days later she sat down to write a very different letter to her dad. She had finally capitulated. After 29 years of distaste for the Exclusive Brethren and six weeks of relentless pressure from her sickly husband, Ruth would also be returning to the church. She told Fred that after hours of darkness, she believed God wanted her to follow her husband. ‘I feel now, Father, you are dearer to me than ever, but he is first. I believe the Lord has enabled me to write this letter.’

She had made her stand, but her emotional torment continued. ‘Feeling yearning over father,’ she wrote plaintively four days after declaring her position to Fred, and then 11 days later, ‘spent some time just tossed with doubts, a few [tears.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4826s)’”

And this illustrates, I think, the turmoil that couples go through when it comes to Brethren, both for those who are inside thinking about leaving, and those on the outside who are being pressured to go back. And you really see this through our great-grandmother's diaries, this fear, this absolute fear that she wasn't on the same page as her [husband,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4860s) and what that might mean for their family, and that he was taking the family in a certain direction, and either she was going to go along with it or she wasn't sure what the consequences were going to be.

And this heartache really, I don't think there was any part of her that wanted to go back into the Exclusive Brethren, but I think the reading between the lines, the fear that their family might be torn apart if she didn't go with her husband, meant that she felt she didn't have a choice. And that's a cruel, cruel position for people to be in. And I think there's so many Brethren couples that will be able to relate to this, not knowing whether you're on the same page as your husband or wife and the consequences of [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4919s) admitting that you feel differently.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4921s)

Yeah, that's so true, Craig. And I remember, it reminds me of our grandmother Anna, who you know, feature later on, but she was in a similar position where she didn't believe in the Brethren and yet she had, yeah, taken marriage vows to her husband. And she also had a deeply religious belief that, you know, you shouldn't break the marriage covenant. And she felt that if she left, she would be breaking the marriage covenant, although it could be argued the other way that if [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4951s) didn't, you know, go with her, he was breaking it.

But we know that from their perspective, it's the fault lies with the person who chooses to leave. But yeah, she and our grandmother was also torn between all these things. And then you throw into that, that this person is on death's door with a cancer, you know, a huge health battle and facing impending death. And they've got three young children. And, you know, you're not going to, you're not going to leave or turn against your sickly dying husband's wishes as well, are you? [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4981s) it's, yeah, I mean, it sounds like she has much made that decision to keep the family together as out of anything. It wasn't necessarily about conviction about the Brethren.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=4992s)

And again, making the point here that this was 1949\. This was well before separation came in.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5000s)

In terms of the eating matter and all that kind of thing. Yes, yeah. Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5006s)

Just to finish off how the cancer ended, because I think this paints a picture of where Brethren thinking was at at that time.

So Alf went to hospital again in 1951\. At that point, the doctors said, basically, you're going to die. We can't treat you any further. And sent him home to make peace with his family.

“Yes, in the spring of 1951, Alf visited Wellington Hospital. The assessment following his weekend stay was bleak. His treatment could go no further, and it was time for him to return home, take peace, and prepare to die. ‘Five doctors all agreed,’ Alf wrote. He was furious, resolving that faith alone was the key to winning his years-long battle with cancer. ‘I believe God I will do so in the face of 500 doctors if need be.’ Ruth too, spurred on by her renewed all or nothing faith, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5062s) convinced the answer lay with God and decided after prayer to put Alf on a complete liquid diet of fruit and vegetable juices.”

And we're starting to see here by this point that they're well back into the Exclusive Brethren. They're really, they've gone in boots and all.

“This fast was to last for 40 days, a scriptural period. For more than two weeks, Alf had nothing but juice. Local Exclusive Brethren brought around boxes of produce, which Ruth juiced, juiced and juiced. Alf was allowed one cup of tea each day at 3pm as a special concession, but after 10 days even the tea disappeared. He noted that he was going weak at the knees and rapidly losing weight. Alf's religious fervour neared delirium and he refused to accept that death was [approaching.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5110s)

On the 14th day of the fast, he went a step further and decided the palliative medicines he had been prescribed at the hospital were hindering his faith. Giving up all medications would show faith in God's ability to command a healing miracle. ‘The doctors haven't given me up, I've given up their remedies too. The sleeping tabs and painkillers are down the drain.’

Wrecked with cancer, starved for a fortnight and now feeling every shooting pain, Alf's ruined body fought on for a few more days. ‘Pain is purifying,’ he wrote in his diary. Three days after giving up his medication, he dragged himself from bed to shuffle up and down the back lawn with five-year-old Aira, inhaling, walking 20 steps, then exhaling, every breath a painful exertion. ‘I could feel the pulsing, tingling life in almost every nerve,’ he wrote, and ‘[virtue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5161s) seemed to flow in from her warm hand into my gaunt, emaciated brain.’

Later that evening, Alf noted triumphantly that he was beating his cancer. ‘The tide has turned.’ His diary ends there. The following day has a short message in Ruth's handwriting. ‘Alf, very ill indeed.’ He died five days later.”

And this, they genuinely believed, and it's very clear from their diaries, they genuinely believed that their Brethren faith was going to save Alf's life. It didn't matter that the doctors at the hospital had said he was going to die. It didn't matter that he was supposed to be taking all his medication. Basically, bugger the doctors and not only are we going to ignore what the doctors are saying, but [we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5214s) going to take him off all of the meds he's supposed to be on to make his death easier. Less pain, the ability to sleep, the ability to exist.

And not only that, but we're going to starve him because fasting is scriptural. And this terrible, terrible death that he had, starved, unable to sleep, wracked with pain, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5245s) still right up until the last sort of, until he lost his ability to write, he was convinced that God as part of their Brethren beliefs was going to heal him. And again, I think the impact that that had on Ruth, his wife, when he died, and you see people go through these, these crises of belief with the Brethren where [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5275s) go all in with their Brethren belief and then something massive happens that challenges their faith. And the Brethren at that point, you're at a crossroads. I think you either acknowledge the bullshit or you go even deeper.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5291s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5292s)

And definitely what happened for our great-grandmother was she went even deeper.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5299s)

And I think, psychologically, I'm not a psychologist and all that sort of thing, but you can see the deep layers of complexity that are going on psychologically here. Like, you know, I certainly don't support at all what they've done here with their, with their belief in faith for healing and, and you know, they've called it faith, they've said that that's why they did it. But I sometimes wonder if extreme acts of faith like that are actually a person in complete and utter denial. Someone who's deep in psychological denial.

And understandably, like he was only in his 30s, wasn't he? Or, and they've got three young children. Like you can understand that for Alf and for Ruth [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5345s) they were absolutely desperate. And their wider family doesn't feature much here, but I'm wondering, you know, what the other family members who weren't part of the Exclusive Brethren were saying to them or challenging them about it, because they must have been incredibly worried about them and not everybody would have supported them doing this fasting and that kind of thing.

Yeah, the people who are clearly, they come across here like people who are in absolute desperation and fair enough to be losing your [life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5375s) at a young age leaving behind three young children. And I wonder if sometimes, I agree with what you've said that people then and after a crisis can, you know, we do respond in different ways. And I agree with you that sometimes people then sort of almost turn deeper to, you know, a certain path. And oftentimes it's actually not necessarily in my view because they believe in that path. It again comes back to kind of a psychological denial or an [inability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5406s) to, you know, it's just like the internal world collapses, which it's what it apparently happened for Ruth.

You know, her faith was shattered after that as well as, as well as her whole world and being left there trying to figure out how to be a solo parent to young children. Of course, in many ways, just at a purely pragmatic level, she would have stayed with the Brethren because they would have been offering that material help of with, with just finances and [surviving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5436s) and meals and with care for the children. And you do what you need to do to survive. And if that means psychologically capitulating, then you psychologically capitulate.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5446s)

And it's the sunk cost fallacy as well, isn't it? Like at this point, you've sacrificed so much into this belief structure that to admit that it's been wrong and to admit that you've made these sacrifices for nothing is too much.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5461s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5462s)

And so you keep going.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5463s)

Yeah, yeah. But it all comes back to having the foundation that the Exclusive Brethren are built on. They again, we come back to that, they've lost their sense of reality, right? And we see that today with them believing that they're above the law, right? They're so naive in what they do and believing like their sense of reality just leaves the whole situation.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5487s)

I think what really warps everything for the Brethren is like their one unshakable belief is that the man of God can do no wrong. Like that is, that's the one single belief that you can't challenge, you can't question. And then when you work backwards from there, like if that must be the case, then that means that these things must be true and these things must be true. And by the time you get out to these sort of quite ordinary [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5517s) about how you should live your life, like because the one central unshakable part of your belief structure is actually bullshit. 

You get out to the edges and it's, it's twisted sort of beyond recognition. You're like, well, how did we end up here? Yeah. It's like because we believe that Bruce Hales has been doing no wrong and for people who are in the Brethren now, when he's as fallible as the rest of us. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5547s) And just skipping through, so this had an impact on Ruth's children. She was a solo mother of three. The oldest was Lindy's grandmother, Anna, and the second was my grandfather, George. And just this chapter four ends talking about my grandpa and grandma meeting each other. This was in Christchurch in the early 60s. So skipping through another generation, there's a section here, and this was [describing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5586s) how rigorously their wedding plans were controlled.

“This level of control was fairly typical among an Exclusive Brethren in 1961\. Members were encouraged to confess their misdeeds at meetings that sometimes stretched until almost midnight. Lottie, a self-righteous teenager, dutifully tattled on the Christchurch brethren in conversations with George, describing how her peers were absolutely broken after being punished for sins including fornication and dressing like the world. But Lottie herself, now 19, wasn't immune to temptation. As her wedding [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5623s) approached, her interactions with George became increasingly amorous. During one of his visits, the young couple went too far one evening after Lottie's family had gone to bed.

Nothing serious happened, just a bit of fumbling really, but in the cold light of day it felt like the end of the world to my 19-year-old grandparents. Overcome with guilt, George confessed to his mother Ruth. She shared the news with a Brethren elder in Wellington who promptly wrote to one of his counterparts in Christchurch. Lottie also confessed to her parents. They told the local elders who arrived on a Wednesday evening to grill her. She told the elders how the young couple had laid down together and she had let her young fiancé put his hands down her neck, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5663s) promised them that through God's mercy it hadn't gone any further.

George was sick with worry about how matters would play out, losing his appetite as he waited for news from Christchurch. ‘No breakfast again this morning,’ he wrote in his diary.

The elders unexpectedly decided the young couple's misdeeds weren't bad enough to warrant public attention. They told Lottie the matter could be closed in private so long as her and George's stories tallied and they'd told the full truth.

60 years later I wonder how Grandpa George would feel about me reading these personal letters. His horror and shame seem a world away, yet strangely it feels as though his letters, carefully saved for many years, have brought us closer together. Being spared public shame was a huge relief for George and Lottie, inspiring the 19-year-olds to recommit to their faith. It was, Lottie told George, a reminder that their marriage would be sacred before God. ‘The main thing is that I'll always have you with me and me with you.’”

And that section for me was quite a shock when I came across this in my grandparents' letters. Because we've all been through those sexual grillings from the priests where we're asked about who did what and who put their hands where. And you feel that's the worst thing in the world and surely you're the first person who has been bad enough to warrant this kind of grilling from the elders. And it was just like a real shock to me to read about my grandparents having the exact same experience [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5764s) generations earlier and was like, nothing has changed.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5768s)

It's really weird, isn't it, Craig? That's just such a good point. Yeah, it really is the same old cycles continuing, handed on from generation to generation. Yeah, really fascinating, really fascinating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5787s)

In a horrifying kind of a way, right? It just blows your mind sitting here just feeling this all, right, of how cyclical this has been for 200 years.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5799s)

It really just, just never stops.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5804s)

Yeah, well it is fascinating seeing how these things are so similar to things that Exclusive Brethren people could have written in their own diaries today, right? Wow. And for people who are listening, not viewing, there are photographs as well that we'll be sharing that you will have seen and we'll keep seeing as well. So if you want to check those out, you can, of these people. So then the book shifts gear, right, Craig? And you move into [chapter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5834s) five. You fast forward back to your own story and your own experiences. And it begins, the line says, "My childhood feelings of being a round peg in a square hole intensified as I grew older."

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5852s)

Yes. This was around the time when I was realising that I was gay and what that meant being in the Brethren, nothing good.

And speaking through to when I was a little bit older, around 18, this was the first time that I had had sex with anyone, my first sexual encounter. And coming off the back of what we've just heard of George and Lottie's experience, you know, remarkably similar feelings. So I'll just pick up my story here.

“ I met Paul through the personal listings in the Southland Times. More than a year after calling the gay sex hotline, which had not gone well, I'd plucked up the courage to go a step further. My crushing fear of being excommunicated was eclipsed by exploding hormones, and I was desperate for [connection.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5901s)

Physical connection, yes, but also emotional connection with someone who understood how I felt. I made an excuse for why I needed to go out that evening. It was the autumn of 2007, a few days short of my 18th birthday. I dialed the number from a payphone on Tai Street. I'd learned my lesson. To my surprise, Paul agreed to meet and invited me over to his home. Fortunately, it wasn't near where any Brethren lived. Members operated like a spy network, and I knew it would be reported back to my parents or the priests if my car was seen parked on an unexpected [street.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5932s)

The first thing I noticed about Paul was his shoulder-length blonde hair. Brethren men weren't allowed to grow their hair long, so this marked him out as a worldly, welcoming, and friendly. He uttered me through to a dimly lit room where a purple mosquito net hung bunched up over a neatly made bed. I could barely speak. Part of me was terrified knowing I was about to cross a point of no return. I also thrilled with anticipation at being so close to another man as we undressed. What do you think of my body? Would he [take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=5962s) the lead and show me what to do? How was I supposed to know where to put my hands and whether he was okay with it? Our encounter was awkward, over almost before it began. I was too embarrassed to tell Paul it was my first time.

Guilt swept through me. I slunk furtively back to my Toyota Corona, hidden up a side street across the road from Donovan Park, and my stomach churned as I scanned for any Brethren observers. Had I been followed? Would my sin be discovered? I didn't know what I'd been thinking. All my life I'd heard terrible stories about warnings about people being cast from the flock. Now I was sure my turn had come. After I snuck home through the back door I couldn't sleep. Convinced my life was over I shut myself [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6005s) the study and with shaking hands called Daniel Hales in Sydney.

The Hales family was still the pinnacle of Brethren fellowship. Daniel's father John Hales had died a few years earlier and Daniel's younger brother was Bruce, the new man of God. Daniel knew I was the great-grandson of Johnny Wright who had rebuked John Hales for speeding all of those years ago. So I knew that if I could plead my case to anyone, it would be directly to the Hales family.

Daniel, a grey-haired, cardigan-wearing businessman, listened as I told him in a trembling voice that I had something terrible to confess. I could still feel Paul's body pressed against mine, my hand running through his long blonde hair, and I tried desperately to push his face out of my mind. In a state of shock, I couldn't bring myself to tell Daniel what I'd actually done, but to my surprise he was kind, fatherly almost, and calmed me down. "Whatever you've done," he said, "there is a way through and it surely won't be as bad [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6063s) you fear." He told me to take my confession to Peter Hickmott, one of the Invercargill elders, and be honest with him about what had happened. ‘Tell him not to do anything without talking to me first.’

The next morning I was shaking as Peter closed the door to his study. I'd barely noticed the autumn clouds or the well-pruned rose bushes lining the park outside. Peter was an awkward man. He and his wife didn't have children and his owlish spectacles and halting nature belied the power he was accumulating within the Brethren system. The man of God himself had stayed in this house and I knew that anything I told Peter would be repeated directly to the Hales brothers in Sydney. Peter questioned me closely as I revealed my [misdeeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6107s) just as Grandpa George had revealed his 50 years earlier.

Who touched what? What went where? How many times? I felt unclean. I wished the floor would open and swallow me. Soldiering on, I gave every last detail I could think of, with one crucial exception. I denied I was gay. I pretended that I'd been experimenting in a foolish, youthful misstep that had no deeper meaning. Peter must have had his doubts, but he kept them to himself. After our meeting, I waited on [tenterhooks,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6138s) pacing my room, unable to engage in conversation, as Peter conferred with Daniel. I was bracing for the axe to fall, knowing I could face public humiliation and excommunication.

When the edict finally came back, I was astonished. Like George and Lottie all those years ago, I was told my confession showed God's spirit was working in me, and the matter of my misdeeds could be closed in private.”

Which really did feel like a narrow escape at the time. But that experience of going through these priestlies where you have all of these details dragged out of you and made to feel like you are the one who's at fault, when really the whole process is completely inappropriate. And then when they do show you grace or compassion as they would describe it, you're thrown back on their mercy and it sort of works to reinforce the system that you're a part of.

When you take a step back and look at it, it's wildly, wildly inappropriate for teenagers to be raked over the coals like this about their sexual activity. It's not, it's not professional and it's not safe.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6224s)

Yeah, my gosh, there's so much going on here. And I think, you know, one of the first thoughts that I had was in this chapter, you know, this chapter is, you know, explicit in a way. Heck, you write about masturbation for goodness sake, you know. Brethren don't say the M word out loud, let alone write it in a book. And so, you know, this chapter, it names stuff, it puts stuff on the table, it puts having sex on the table, it puts calling hotlines on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6254s) table.

And I guess I just want to say at the outset that all of these things that are supposedly so taboo and nobody does them are incredibly common across the Brethren and that there's, you know, everybody in the Brethren, hello, hello, despite your headscarf and your lovely white shirt or whatever, you have a sexuality. And everybody at some point has, you know, mentally, [physically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6284s) engaged with their sexuality and engaged with experimentation or thinking either, either with just themselves or with others.

We also know from, you know, hearing accounts as well as maybe our own experiences that again, many of these lovely people sitting in their rows in the Brethren have experimented with sexual encounters with people on the outside. And increasingly now that they have got [technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6315s) and the internet available to them, that the use of pornography and online sex and chat rooms and all that kind of thing to connect sexually with people has absolutely exploded across the board among the Brethren.

So I kind of want to name it at the outset to go, you know what, this freaking isn't taboo or it shouldn't be taboo because it's so common that, you know, I would go so far as to say that probably every single person in the Brethren, whether they're now a gray-haired [80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6345s) year old or they're a pimply faced 16 year old has probably had illicit sexual encounters. And so I, I love, I actually love that you, as awkward as it might feel from a Brethren perspective to discuss this stuff openly, it's like, yes, this needs to be discussed openly.

It needs to be tabled and we need to talk about the Brethren response, which is so black and white and categories of morality. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6376s) that you as a young person struggling with your sexual identity and orientation, you know, what you needed was understanding, somebody to listen to you, somebody to explain to you what being gay was, that you're not a freak, that this is a known phenomena. And yes, there's a broad spectrum within that of gay experience and expression. But [instead,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6407s) you are responded just solely with the category of this is sin, this is evil, this is darkness. That was the only category you were given to interpret your experiences through.

And I think it's the same for masturbation, it's the same for so many of these things. It's like, bang, this, even sexual abuse, right? It wasn't, you know, as you know, so many times it wasn't responded to in the sense of what is going on here, even for a [perpetrator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6437s) or an abuser, what's going on here? Let's talk about this. It is instead responded to by priests in the category of sin and shame and moral failure, right? It's wrong. It's...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6451s)

It was such a failure because you had no concept of how widespread it was or what everyone else was up to because nobody was admitting it. I was talking to a leaver recently and they were saying like, they were convinced that they had a sex addiction problem because one of the rules was that you had to be pure for at least six months before you got married, which meant like no masturbating for six months before your wedding [day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6481s) And they had realized or they had resigned themselves that they would never ever be able to go six months without masturbating. Therefore, they would never be able to get married.

And they'd held this belief that there must be something wrong with them for such a long time because that was what they were talking about. And there's this, what we're talking about and there's this dawning look as they're like, I only just realized that everybody was masturbating in there and lying about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6512s)

And no priest should even know. You shouldn't, to any that's listening to this right now, that is nobody's business. No priest should, that shouldn't come out of anybody's mouth and you shouldn't have to report that to anybody. That that is your own personal, that's your own personal experience with your own intimacy with yourself. Like that is not, that is not up to anybody else to have that kind of information.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6542s)

Exactly.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6543s)

Yeah, if you want to talk about, you know, if you want to talk about your sexual expression or identity or experimentation or whatever, you know, then seek out professional help. There are trusted professionals, and again, be careful of that because there are people who market themselves out there as being someone to talk to about these things and they might not be safe. So, but you can find like qualified, trained sexual health therapists and professionals who can give you a balanced view. And you can find Christian ones if you want to find a, you know, there are other Christian worldviews on this kind [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6579s) topic than just this very black and white category of it is only sin and only shameful.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6588s)

Talk to a  professional, not a priest.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6589s)

Yeah, that should be on a shirt. Find the Olive Leaf Network.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6600s)

Exactly. So we'll just skip through to the end of that chapter because I'd been cast on, I'd become part of the Brethren system of confessions and priestlies and where you confess this idea that you have to confess every last sin because that's what gets you in the clear. And so this went on and on and on.

And this is how the chapter ends.

“Away from the preaching and backslapping, doubts crept through my mind like shadows at dusk, swirling together with curiosity in an intoxicating dance. But when I started asking questions, I was quickly shut down. It was perplexing to me. The Bible recounted how Jesus, age 12, had sat questioning his elders in the temple. If that was good enough for Jesus, I reasoned, surely questions were okay. During group conversations after church meetings, I openly challenged some of our teachings while my fellow Brethren [awkwardly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6662s) shuffled their feet.

Why can't we be left to make our own judgments about what TV shows are okay? Why is it okay for Brethren to campaign for political parties but not okay for us to vote? Questions like these were a direct challenge to the divinely appointed man of God.

It was deeply isolating to have doubts when everyone in my community was supposed to be moving in lockstep. There was no diversity of thought and disagreement was tantamount to treason. I didn't know how to find others who shared my doubts. Most were too afraid to speak out and if I had revealed my true feelings to someone, there was a chance they would have reported me to the priests. A careless word could have got me excommunicated. For most Brethren, the only path was to just keep quiet, but as the church tried to control my [understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6708s) of the world, I was already grasping the scope of what lay beyond.

Athol Greene did his best to head off my doubts when I tentatively shared them during our phone calls. He said I should stay loyal to Peter Hickmott, ‘the Lord has given him to you,’ and that if I couldn't muster my own faith, I should fall into the line behind Brethren whose faith was stronger than mine.

As we continued our conversations, I from my bedroom, he from his home in Penrith, Athol warned that if I allowed any doubts, the devil would try to get me to discount the Brethren. These chats with Athol weren't all doom and gloom. He was still optimistic that I would find a way through and settle down as a loyal Brethren member. ‘Keep at it, son, just keep at it. We're going to win.’ The key to this, Athol said, was to unfailingly follow the teachings of his son-in-law, Bruce Hales, the Man of God, a [lovely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6759s) man. And then Athol added, ‘He's Christ.’

This sort of talk, while blasphemous to most Christians, was fairly common among the Brethren, that they were increasingly putting the man of God on the same level as Jesus himself. And Athol had no qualms about doing so. ‘All you need in your soul,’ Athel told me, ‘comes from these great men.’” 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6785s)

Well, there's a lot to unpack there. Much to unpack, could be another podcast all in itself.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6788s)

Yeah, this whole, looking back, it's astonishing that Athol Greene, may he rest in peace, yeah, would describe his own son-in-law like, just, yeah, "He's Christ." Yeah, yeah. And this is like, for anyone who's listening, this is not me remembering a conversation that happened. Like as I was talking to Athol Greene, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6818s) was writing down everything he was saying verbatim and I believed it at the time. And so this is taken directly from the notes of our conversations at the time. So this is not just me misremembering it with a particular sort of anti-Brethren lens. This is what was said as I wrote down as the Brethren member believing everything that was being said.

And it was, it's terrifying to have doubts in the Brethren when this is what you're being told.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6854s)

Yeah, yes, yeah. Like it's, I mean on page 107, and you know, I want to say as well to the listeners that don't consider just because you've listened to this podcast that you don't need to read the book, because Craig is missing out so much and there's so many paragraphs, yeah, there's so many paragraphs and little anecdotes that, yeah, just really describe so much more. Like this really is a whistle-stop tour. And so do read the book when you get a chance. But yeah, page [107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6885s) you talk about doubts a wee bit more and you said, "Doubts were considered a sin by the Brethren."

Popular refrains from the church leaders included statements like, "We'll do the thinking, you do the doing," and "If you don't understand it, just don't question it." And you know, we kind of laugh when we hear those because we remember them. I remember those quotes and you know, they're thought-stopping cliches is a term used I think to describe them in the kind of field of the culty-sphere. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6915s) you're right, doubts themselves were, they were actually considered a sin as well and taboo. You are not allowed to express doubts, even in the form of a question.

And so when you've got someone who's close to Bruce Hales as well, and that gives him added authority, saying, you know, "He's Christ," it really is, would have been taken by this young you as absolute fact that he is Christ. And while you knew it didn't necessarily maybe mean that he was actually Jesus Christ, you knew the point of what he was saying, which is that he is Christ to us, that he is, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6959s) know, the manifestation of God that we have in front of us and that, yeah, his word is divine and all that kind of thing.

And all of it is reinforcing this thing that if you go against what this Christ says, you will go to outer darkness and ruin. Like it's just building up this incredible polarization, right, of like this wrestle within you and this wrestle without of choices, and which choice do I take and being [reinforced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=6990s) that if you choose being gay or to leave the Brethren and to leave Christ that you know, you know, you'll only go to darkness. And yet you're wrestling with this inattention going, I don't just don't think that's right. I don't think I can agree with it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7007s)

And it feels like you're being torn apart, yeah. And it's that feeling but when you know that something's a bit, but you don't dare let yourself admit it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7024s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7025s)

And I think that's still the experience that a lot of people in the Brethren are having where they think that the louder, the louder you shout it, the easier it'd be to make yourself believe it. And that's just not the case. Saying this, shouting it from the rooftops is not going to make it any more true.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7055s)

Yeah, and it's really, I, yeah, I appreciate that line in there that you read out that everyone in the community was supposed to be moving in lockstep because that is so true. And yeah, it's an interesting term, lockstep. Like it brings to mind that kind of military soldier, like everyone dress the same, move the same, think the same. And that is what it was like to be part of the Brethren. And it is still like that today to a large extent. Even I'm fascinated that they've moved to having their schools to be [global](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7086s). And again, it's very similar that you know, internationally the, the, the rooms have all got to look the same, they've all got the same posters, they've all got the same furniture, like they've got the same uniforms. It's right from a young age that unbelievable uniformity is being conditioned into these people and it is terrifying to step out of that lockstep.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7108s)

And you know, to all the insiders in there, doubts are healthy, doubts are normal, doubts are often our intuition and our gut and our own spirit speaking to ourselves that's saying, "Hey, something isn't right here." So write your doubts down. Maybe that's something that you guys can do is write them down and like don't just hand your doubts over to a priest like that's, that you know, is going to squash them. Do your own research, find ways to research the [doubts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7138s) that you're having.

**Craig Hoyle**

Like Lindy did.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7139s)

Yeah, I, well I keep, you know, before I wrote the letter to Bruce Hales, I kept my notes, my doubts. I was writing them down in a notebook and I bought a locked briefcase and I kept them in that because again, this is the days before phones and stuff, so I couldn't take notes on my phone. But I actually had to have a locked briefcase because I knew you weren't allowed to write and explore your doubts. And I wasn't writing anything bad or anything condemning the Brethren.

It was literally just my questions and some of them were so inane and it was like, [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7170s) can't men wear shorts? Why can't I, you know, take a meal to my neighbor who's sick? And some of them were a bit more, you know, intense like, why, why is, you know, people of a different race not allowed to marry each other in the Brethren and why can't I go to university? But yeah, my initial thought was just, I just want the answers for these. If the Brethren are right and they're God's only position, there will be answers and I'll find them. So I encourage you, dear Brethren, go and read the ministry, [go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7200s) and do that because that's what I did. I dug into the ministry, I didn't have internet, I dug into the ministry and I dug into the Bible looking for answers to my doubts and my questions. And I encourage you to do the same. Go on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7212s)

See where it leads. And if you don't want to write it down and you don't have a locked briefcase, make yourself an anonymous email account and just keep all your stuff in your own email account.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7228s)

I think that leads us on neatly to the next chapter. And we'll just skip through a bit here, but it talks about the introduction of separation and what that did to families at the time. And so our great-grandmother Ruth cut off all of her family outside of the Brethren and a cruel, cruel experience for so many people.

But through all this, Anna and George, so that's Lindy's nana and my grandpa, were raising young families. And so we pick up in the 1970s here, going back to the doubts thing;

“As Ruth grappled with the consequences of rejecting her family, her children, Anna and George, were too busy raising their own to spare much time thinking about doctrine. For George, it was easier just to go with the flow. Distracted by three children, he didn't pay much attention as rules were introduced, slowly and gradually. However, by the 1970s, the siblings were having nagging doubts about whether the Exclusive Brethren were everything they claimed to be. Members were routinely excommunicated [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7297s) minor infractions like wearing shorts or listening to the radio.

And Anna agonized over the love and compassion that seemed to be missing from the increasingly hard-line church. Part of her regretted not following Gerald Cowell when he had objected to Big Jim's separation doctrine, which she thought went far beyond what scripture could justify.

 In a bizarre twist, when Anna fell under church discipline in 1977, it had nothing to do with her doubts. The elders in Auckland discovered she and Rob had taken their children to sex [education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7327s) evenings five years earlier. Anna hadn't had any sex talks from Ruth and didn't want her own children growing up ignorant.

On the evening the eldest daughter, Kathleen, got engaged, priests turned up at the family's doorstep. They questioned Rob about those innocent classes and claimed he was evasive in his answers. That was enough for them to justify shutting him and Anna up so the matter could be investigated further. What was supposed to be a night of celebration turned to horror as the six eldest children were ordered to pack [suitcases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7358s) and then bundled out the door to stay with other Brethren families in Auckland, their parents feeling they had no choice but to comply. It was the last Anna saw of her children for eight months.

Like my grandma Edith, Anna sat heartbroken at home under assembly discipline while her eldest daughter's marriage was approved by Brethren elders. Kathleen had only just turned 18 and her grandmother Ruth, now living in Wellington, travelled to Auckland to be there at a wedding day in the absence of Kathleen's mother. Kathleen was the first of Ruth's grandchildren to marry, but how could Ruth fully enjoy the occasion, knowing her daughter Anna, missed terribly by Kathleen, was under assembly discipline. Ruth noted in her diary that [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7400s) had been a very, very happy occasion, yet a shadow in the background that Robert and Anna were not available.

Anna, a busy mother of seven, had gone from a frenetic home and church routine to ghostly silence overnight. She was kept sane only by her youngest daughter, who at two and a half was deemed too young to be removed to Brethren custody. Being separated from her children was a lesson for Anna in what the church's punishment could look like. After that, she tried to do a better job of conforming to the rules. My grandpa George, Anna's brother, mostly supported the Brethren practice of shunning rule breakers until it [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7437s) to him. As Brethren misdemeanors went, it was minor.

 His wife, Lottie, had taken their three kids to swim at a nearby beach after school on a hot summer afternoon. Where she went wrong was also taking children from another Brethren family, as this was a breach of a recent ban on mixed bathing, which dictated that males and females should not swim together if they went from the same family. The local priest confronted George about it. ‘Why did you allow mixed bathing to go on in your household?’ And he covered for Lottie to avoid throwing her under the bus. He hadn't even known about the beach trip, so it wasn't a question of whether he had allowed it to happen, but he accepted the principle that a man should be responsible for his house and took his punishment on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7477s) chin.

George and Lottie were shut up at home for several weeks, while the priests grilled him about the mixed bathing incident. To George's surprise, there was no deep spiritual searching or sympathetic comfort from the priests during their confinement. Instead, it was all procedural based on how to keep to the rules. He had always assumed that being shut up before coming back to the meetings would lead to renewed faith and was an opportunity for spiritual cleansing. The priests, he had previously believed, needed to wait for some kind of breakthrough to show that he and [Lottie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7508s) were sorry and could be forgiven.

But to his surprise, no such moment arrived. After a few weeks, the priests decided the couples had sufficiently faced their sins. The men duly reported that George and Lottie could be restored to happy fellowship, but George didn't feel any difference to how he'd been before the experience. After that, he paid closer attention as if peers were shut up and withdrawn from. There was nothing spiritual or godly or encouraging about it, he soon realised. He came to see it as a crushing [process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7538s) In his eyes, these people had been hammered down until they agreed not to make waves anymore. Picking at the thread didn't end there, the doubts kept coming as the 1970s rolled into the 1980s. One question about the Brethren kept rolling around in his head. He wondered if somewhere along the line they had stopped being the one true church.”

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7562s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7564s)

So powerful.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7564s)

Powerful. And so much more. There's so much more in that chapter as well, hey, that you haven't read out and haven't discussed now. But wow, yeah. And it's fascinating that that thing of, you know, George kind of being busy with his family and going along with it all. And then his experience of, what did you say, it wasn't until it happened to him. Somebody said something about, yeah, I'm not realizing what [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7594s) priestlies were like and what the process of church discipline was like and how actually unscriptural and unspiritual it was and how brutally unfair it was until it happened to him.

Because I now think that for my father Steve and his, he's been interviewed by Cheryl on this podcast as well, but I think that the process was probably similar for him in some ways that I think sometimes it's not until you really feel the underbelly of it all yourself, you really feel the harsh side. It's easy to kind of [keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7624s) living in denial and just, well, I guess you're just trusting that the priests are doing a good job and you believe their line, you know, they trot out at the meeting and say, "Oh, so-and-so wasn't walking with 2 Timothy 2," and you just trust them. And that person never gets the chance to share their side of the story, so you don't know.

Whereas, you know, George went through this experience just like all these years later his nephew, my dad, experienced of actually this [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7654s) what did you say, "There was nothing spiritual or godly or encouraging about it. He came to see it as a crushing process. These people had been hammered down until they agreed not to make waves anymore." Wow. So many of us who have been experienced church discipline from the Brethren would describe that that was the process that we have endured.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7678s)

And this is like, again, this has been going on for such a long time. Like this is our grandparents' generation describing this, but it could be how any of us described it now. Yes, this is...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7690s)

50 years ago.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7692s)

And for as much as the line you keep hearing from people who are still in, "We've changed, things are different now, we don't operate like that anymore." And the light of that really is that people keep leaving and they keep describing the experiences they are having right now. And I am in contact, as Lindy and Cheryl no doubt are, with so many people who are still in the Brethren or who are in the process of leaving [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7722s) the way they are describing those experiences is exactly as my grandpa George was describing it here from 50 years ago.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7731s)

Yeah, that's right. And it's actually quite freakish and quite bizarre, isn't it? Like, I mean that reading George's letter that he read out to the, well sorry, he didn't read it, he posted it out to the Wellington assembly. He was planning to preach it on a Tuesday night or something, wasn't he? But then he got excommunicated and couldn't, so he put it into a letter form and post it to Wellington assembly. And yeah, and again, I can't remember what year that was and you might cover it in the book, but I remember reading that [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7761s) 50 years later and being like, "Oh my gosh, like there's so much in here of what I also have just written to Bruce Hales." Like it was like, what, this is bonkers. It's like all these years apart and it's the same character, the same spirit of things as you've said.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7781s)

And it's different, it's different rules. Like it's whether you can listen to the radio or whether you can use a fax machine. And now it's whether you can have a phone without Streamline. Whether that, like in a way that the rules that are being argued about don't really matter. Like the underlying passion here is the control that sits behind it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7804s)

A pig is still a pig whether it's got lipstick on or whatever, I don't know. You know, it's like...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7809s)

My parents, like when Bruce Hales took over, right, it was the same that was brought to me out. It's everything's changed in here, everything's changed. And you know, all you can see is that Bruce Hales just took them into this candy shop, right? Everything was changed, but it's still locked on the outside, right? To the point where the police were interrogating somebody the other day, the other day. And you know, it was said they were like, it was a family that was treated badly [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7839s) they're like, "Oh no, no, no, like they, we've been apologized to. It's all been forgiven. We're not like that anymore."

And no, like to those people that are, those just simple grassroots Brethren that are watching this just to see what we're up to. It is still like that. It 110% is still like this. Nothing has changed because the color of your house that Bruce has you inside is painted differently. The lock is still on the front door. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7870s) just the insides have changed. It's all still the same.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7872s)

He's given you more toys to play with and bought in material, material prosperity and indulgence because that's his own personal Achilles heel and the thing that, you know, he really loves himself. He wants a lovely comfortable golden cage with lots of toys and he's making that available for everybody else too because he's so generous and kind. But yeah, it is, it, it's the same, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7897s)

I mean, the acid test really is if you stand up in the middle of a meeting now and say Bruce Hales is wrong, what's going to happen to you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7906s)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7908s)

The same thing that's been happening for the last hundred years, more than a hundred years.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7912s)

And that horrendous podcast here, I can't remember the young man's name or if it was actually given, but where they just, where they played the priestly, the priest...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7921s)

Yeah, podcast 110\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7923s)

Oh, absolutely horrendous. And the link, I mean that priestly was not from that long ago, was it? And the language they used again of like, "Do you want to go into hell and outer darkness and ruin or do you want to, you know, be here with with our beloved brother Bruce Hales?" All that, it's like, yeah, at the core of it, exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7948s)

And I'm sure there was many, many people that related to that podcast. I know all the young ones in Maple Creek that got priestly visits in Maple Creek,   that's what our priestly visits were like. Whether it was on my paper route or whether it was in our living room or whether it was out in the car in front of the house or out in a field somewhere else, that is how we got talked to in Maple Creek, you know. And so I think it's super important that we lay it out the way that you're laying it out, Craig, and showing that this isn't something that just popped up now. [Right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7978s) It's been happening for a long, long time. It hasn't changed. Just that your building that you're sitting in has changed.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7987s)

Yeah. Exactly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7990s)

Chapter seven.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7992s)

Aberdeen.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=7995s)

Aberdeen. Drum roll.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8000s)

I think what's, before we get to the Aberdeen part of chapter seven, is just really important to just talk for a bit about the rise of alcohol in the Brethren in the 1960s, and what a massive impact that had on Brethren doctrine, and how I think the rise of alcohol in the 60s was part of what tipped the Exclusive Brethren from being sort of an ultra-conservative [cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8030s) to being a cult that was also like a bit nuts.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8036s)

And that also had like huge sanctioned indulgences within their community because before that there was this strong thread of sort of, which again came through I understand from Darby, there was this austerity and, you know, asceticism of, yeah, that, you know, not indulging so much in the pleasures of the world and, yeah, whether it was alcohol or fine gardens or houses or material luxury, those things were, you know, eschewed.

Like, Darby did, I understand, you know, wasn't into his fancy food and would travel around on horseback and that kind of side of him did mark the Brethren, that they weren't into all that stuff. And the wider Brethren too, you know, not just the exclusives, but they weren't known for not being so into material prosperity and the pleasures of life. Whereas it was like alcohol just opened that door for that, didn't it? And as the saying says, the fish rots from the head. Like, let's be clear, the love of alcohol and the Brethren has 100% come from the leaders. Yeah, it's not just something that's like a subculture among some people and the Brethren, it was encouraged and endorsed and held up as a role model from Christ, [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8118s) the one at the top.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8119s)

Saying, "Pour me a whiskey." And then now they've added antidepressants onto it. So I think that's the biggest thing is like, I don't know if you guys don't know inside there, but you're not supposed to mix alcohol with antidepressants and that's a massive problem that is happening inside there. I mean, that does so much damage to the brain.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8141s)

Yeah. Let me just read a bit of the rise of alcoholism. Yeah.

“Elect Vessel James Taylor's journey, his path to alcoholism was slow at first and then swept the Exclusive Brethren with a vengeance. Big Jim was a shy man. As he jostled to protect his father's legacy in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he found that having a few drinks of scotch helped him get through the meetings where he was expected to take a leading role. Until then, Brethren had been largely teetotal, drinking in moderation or not at all, and most members had no frame of reference for seeing the effects of alcohol on one another. Hard [liquor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8180s) was up there with cigarettes as one of the vices of the world, until the script suddenly flipped.

Big Jim's few drinks spiralled as he rose to prominence. By the time he visited New Zealand to host meetings at the Whangarei Town Hall in early 1962 he was openly encouraging previously teetotal Brethren to join him in taking up the bottle. The whole meeting centred around the idea that we should be free to drink, an astonishing turn of events for the gathered conservative Brethren farmers and small business owners who had congregated to hear the elect vessel on a special visit from New York. Big Jim reasoned that alcohol was part of God's creation and therefore meant to be enjoyed by the saints. Nobody did point out the obvious, but it was on people's minds. Well, so is tobacco.

Whiskey drinking soon became a test of faith. If you weren't doing it, then you were out of line with the elect vessel. Big Jim, previously shy, increasingly led riotous church meetings, while few Brethren recognized that he was in the advanced stages of alcoholism. Dignified old men were made to stand up and get publicly humiliated for not drinking. Even pregnant women were forced to drink. [Alcohol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8258s) loosened your tongue, the logic went, so if you avoided drinking, it must mean you had something to hide. The Brethren coined a number of absurd phrases to justify their alcohol consumption, and these were still regularly repeated when I was a teenager decades later. ‘Drink and be free.’ And ‘Drink makes a strong man stronger and a weak man weaker.’"

I still can't say that with a straight face.

And just skipping through, this is talking about the extremist doctrine that came through. And then;

“By 1965, Big Jim's drinking was so heavy that he had to be hospitalized due to the effects of alcohol on his liver. But by the end of the decade, he was drinking heavily again. When he visited his daughter, Consie Hales, in Sydney for Christmas 1969, they drank until they were bleary-eyed. On a trip to Canada the same year, Big Jim emerged from his bedroom the morning after his arrival and spotted the host's whiskey collection, [asking,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8313s) "Can I have some of that with breakfast?"

The host, astonished but knowing it was unthinkable to turn down such a request from the elect vessel, told him to go ahead and watched in further astonishment as Big Jim filled a water glass with black-label scotch, then drank it with his bacon and eggs. Big Jim's host kept track that weekend. The elect vessel was drinking a bottle and a half of whiskey a day.”

And I think that's a really good scene setter for leading up to what happened at Aberdeen is at this point, JTJr. was so far down the alcoholism stage that a lot of the time, not much of what he said made sense. And there are still recordings of him, including at Aberdeen, where he's almost incoherent. And the Brethren were really tying themselves up into knots at this point in the late 1960s because if you believe that the Man of God or the elect vessel can do no wrong or he's Christ, as Athol Greene later said about Bruce Hales, you can't possibly admit to yourself that there's something wrong with this person, that this person is an alcoholic, that [alcohol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8389s) is impacting how this person is behaving.

And so you end up in a really messed up place where everything that this person says, you're having to retrofit all of your other beliefs to make it make sense. And so I think that for the Brethren in the late 1960s, they were getting to a really difficult place where they were having to go sort of further and further down these quite extreme paths [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8419s) try and apply some kind of logic to the way the vessel was behaving and when it was clear to any outsider that he was, you know, off his trolley, so to speak.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8433s)

Yeah, exactly right, Craig. That's, that's a helpful term, that term retrofitting, because you're right. And it's what you mentioned earlier about, you know, for the Brethren, they've made the starting point this place of saying, you know, they've made it the cornerstone of their, their whole system, the whole doctrine is, is to say that this leader is the divinely appointed Paul of our day, another expression that's used, harking back to Paul the apostle, saying that he is this divinely appointed, infallible person.

And and therefore everything else that happens has to be interpreted from that perspective. And so no matter what their behavior is, whether it's alcoholism, whether it's indecency with women, whether it's potentially illegalities or or unethical things with money, oh no, the leader can't be wrong. It wasn't them, that's been misinterpreted, that they're a good godly person. And it's, there's some other reason to explain [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8492s) of this.

I mean, the recordings from from him around that time are unbelievable. As you say, they, to an outsider, you're like, this guy's off his rocker. It's as clear as anything. And you can get, you know, you record some of what he's saying on page 135 and these recordings are available as you said, but he, I mean, he used vile words. He'd talk about people's breasts and bottoms. And he, you know, he's, he's one of some of what he said at one meeting,

 "You bum, you, you big bum, [Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8523s) bum, Scott bum, Scott. Now you have it. You've never had it so good, you stinking bum."

 Like what? Like in what planet is this somebody who's the manifestation of the spirit of God, someone who talks like this? Like it actually defies belief.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8543s)

Again, we're so far removed from reality. Like that's what happens when you place somebody in the position like they place their man of God in. We, we have this issue, reality is just dissolved. And I'll touch up, I will put a little bit of a clip of that what, what Lindy just read out and I'll attach the full link to that recording that Craig and Lindy you're referring to below in the description.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8934s)

I just think it's really important to make the point here as well that the Brethren who were in Aberdeen for these meetings believed in JTJr. Like they had already gone through separation, they had already gone through losing all their fishing boats in Scotland, but there had already been sort of these massive tests of faith in JTJr. that had brought them to this point. And so nobody, nobody was [arriving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8964s) in Aberdeen thinking, "Hey, let's take down the elect vessel." Nobody was thinking, "Hey, we're going to go there and challenge him on what he says."

Everybody who was there at Aberdeen was there believing that JTJr. was the elect vessel, believing that he was God's divine representative, believing that everything he said came straight from heaven. And so they were trying to make it make sense. And like I think what Aberdeen shows is that you can [retrofit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=8994s), but you can, like everybody has a tipping point. You can only retrofit so far before you're forced to admit that something's not right...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9006s)

 Or to chop off large parts of your brain to make sure that you can fit.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9011s)

And for, this was the point. And I think the other thing, the people who were at these meetings in Aberdeen, and what Lindy was just reading out there, took place during the Saturday meetings at Aberdeen. Nobody challenged JTJr. on what he was saying. Everybody was going along with it. Everybody was, if not explicitly agreeing with it, everybody was happy to be there. There was cheering in the room, people were going along with it. Aberdeen wasn't a hostile environment for JTJr.

And it really only unraveled after it became clear what had happened outside of the meetings. And if you think this kind of talk in the meetings is outrageous, then this was really the only tip of the iceberg for what had happened in Aberdeen. And it came to a head, so this happened at the Saturday meetings, and then these 500 Brethren showed up for the Sunday meeting at the main hall in Aberdeen, and JTJr. was nowhere to be seen.

You can imagine what that would be like now if Bruce Hales just disappeared in the middle of three day meetings. It would, it would be, it would cause a stir. Everybody would want to know what was going on. And so you've got these 500 Brethren gathered at the meeting room in Aberdeen trying to work out what the heck has happened to JTJr.

And so we'll pick up back here explaining what had happened. Gradually, the story emerged. The elect vessel had been involved in a major bust up the night before and had been sent packing.

“Big Jim had taken a liking to 35-year-old Madeline Ker, a Brethren woman just half his age, with a demure smile and shoulder-length dark brown hair. Madeline and her husband, Alan, had been invited to attend the special meetings in Aberdeen. They were originally billeted to stay with Brethren and nearby Lawrence Kirk, but their plans were rearranged at Big Jim's insistence so they could stay with him at the home of an Aberdeen leader named Alex Gardner, a rising star among the British Brethren. That Thursday night, brethren gathered in the Gardner [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9146s) were baffled as they watched Alan Ker lead his barefooted wife, clad in a dressing gown, through to the Elect Vessel's bedroom. Alan then returned to his own bedroom alone, and his wife wasn't seen leaving Big Jim's room until 6 the next morning.

That Friday evening, she was again led by her husband to the elect vessel's bedroom around 11pm, and again Alan returned to his own room alone. When Big Jim wasn't in his bedroom with Madeline, he was holding court with whiskey and women in the living room of the trim blue and white bungalow. A steady supply of hard liquor was passed around. As he became increasingly intoxicated on the Friday evening, he demanded that the women in the room sit on his lap one by one. A queue of them, some [quite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9190s) young, some married, some single, formed beside his chair, and husbands were forced to watch as the elect vessel fondled their wives' breasts, legs and bottoms. Several of the women wept as they awaited their turn, but Big Jim just joked about how the underwear prevented easy access.”

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9208s)

Their host, what a bastard. What a bastard. I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt. It's just, it's this despicable abuse of power. I, I just, you know, I just, yeah, probably as a woman as well, just like putting myself in those shoes, that is, that is a huge sexual violation, a violation of every part of those women and of their husbands. And it's just despicable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9234s)

And can you think of what those women were feeling like down there? You, what they were feeling like? They know their husbands can't stick up for them. They know they have to endure that. They know it's not right. And you literally have to sit there and allow it to happen.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9251s)

Exactly. And so carrying on, because it gets worse:

“Their host, Gardner, was shocked by what was happening. As music started up again from an expensive electric organ, trucked in 100 miles for the occasion, children were told to leave the room in order to shield them from the elect vessel's behaviour. Shame hung in the air as he sucked at a young woman's mouth. She did not respond in kind, and her humiliation was palpable as others watched on in horror. Her husband, feeling unable to defend her against someone so powerful in the church, bowed his head so he wouldn't [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9288s) what was happening, but he found it impossible to ignore the slobbering kisses to which she was being subjected.

This wasn't new behaviour for Big Jim. Through the late 1960s, he would often demand that young women line up after church services for a holy kiss. If any of them refused his advances, she was seen as being out of step with God's will.

That Saturday afternoon, as Big Jim took a break from raving at the gathered Brethren, Madeline was once more led to his bedroom. The hosts had tried to barricade the hall with furniture to block her path, but she and her husband forced their way through, cracking a large glass door pane in the process. When she came out of the room, she told Gardner that Big Jim had ordered her to say their host was a son of a bitch and a bastard. Gardner felt that he was in an impossible position. The elect vessel could supposedly do no wrong. Later [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9340s) evening, when Big Jim and Madeline did not emerge for dinner, the distraught host decided he had no choice but to confront the elect vessel.

In a letter Gardner wrote a week later, setting out his perspective on what had happened, he explained, ‘I felt I had to find out what was happening in my house. I went through to Mr. Taylor's bedroom and found Mrs. Kerr undressed and in bed with Mr. Taylor. He had on his pajama top, which was open down the front.’ Big Jim was unrepentant. When questioned by a witness [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9370s) to whether his behaviour was morally suitable, he simply replied, ‘Yes.’ A horrified Gardner insisted that Madeline and her husband leave immediately. From his perspective, this was in order to protect his house.

Big Jim, enraged, tried to follow Madeline into the night, saying, ‘She is my woman.’ Several Brethren men physically restrained the Elect Vessel. For these Scottish followers, it was a step too far to allow God's voice on earth to chase after a married woman who a short while earlier had been found naked in his bed. [In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9401s) the letter, Gardner described what happened next. ‘JT Jr. became very difficult, calling me bastard, son of a bitch, and to all go to hell. I had to send for Dr. Bill Thompson, who had been attending to him for the last three to four weeks. JT Jr. became very quiet when Dr. Thompson arrived, and he was given an injection and tablets. Dr. Thompson said that medically he was a sick man, but the moral side is a matter for the priests.’

Big Jim's son, James Taylor III, arrived in Aberdeen on a 1:20am flight, having been summoned by concerned Brethren to take his father home. A few hours later the Taylors were on their way back to New York.”

Just to explain here that this is taken from letters from witnesses who were there and also from emails of people who were there. And there are still people alive who were in the rooms when these things happened. There were still witnesses to the truth of these things. By and large, the people who are the loudest defenders of JT Jr. around the time of Aberdeen are people who were nowhere near the place. And overwhelmingly, people who were at Aberdeen and people who were close to Aberdeen and people who knew people who were at Aberdeen walked away. Because for these people who were there, this was a tipping point.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9502s)

There's a reason why nearly all of the Brethren in Scotland who were in fellowship with him at this point left the church. It was several thousand of them, wasn't it? Like, and as you say, they were the ones closest to it and who knew firsthand witnesses and who could hear from them. And it's a fascinating point what you said about those who defend it most loudly were the furthest away from the scene. And also, I might add, [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9532s) the ones with the most to lose if people do realize that the great men are fallible.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9537s)

And I think it's just, so just the next bit here to describe how the Brethren reacted to Aberdeen in real time.

So Ian Arbon is one of the people that I talked to for the book, and the Arbon family were in Aberdeen for the meeting because they had family there.

“Ian Arbon was recalled home from Aberdeen with his family. His dad had received a phone call from the leader in Peterborough, who demanded they come back immediately and give an account of themselves. When the Arbon family showed up to the Tuesday night meeting, having rushed the 450 miles home, local elders asked whether they supported the supposedly treasonous Aberdeen brethren. The Arbons were the only ones in the room who had been at the Aberdeen meetings. Ian, his father and his brother confirmed they stood with [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9590s) Scottish brethren. They tried to give an account of why they'd reached that view, but were shouted down from all sides. They were then escorted to the door.

Feeling rather shell-shocked, the Arbon family waited outside the meeting room to see if anything else would happen. Over the next few minutes, about 70 people walked out and came over to the Arbons wanting to know more about what they hadn't been allowed to say in the meeting room. Of course, the Arbons were more than happy to tell them. Most of those 70 Peterborough Brethren were excommunicated for daring to question the purity and holiness of the elect vessel and only a few returned.”

And so you can see from this that the Brethren didn't allow even any discussion about what had happened to Aberdeen, even when there were direct witnesses who had been there, who had seen what JTJr. had said and done, and who, like, to me this was one of the places, I mean, among many others, where the Brethren really [departed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9656s) from the scriptural principles that they'd been known for, you know, the whole concept of in the eyes of two or three witnesses, let a matter be established.

And around the time of Aberdeen was really where you saw to some extent that principle fall away, where it was even when you had direct witnesses who were there in the meeting room with you, it was more important to shout those witnesses down to make sure that they weren't heard so that they couldn't share their side of the story, because what they said even as witnesses is was a threat to the version of events that had been circulated by the leadership.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9704s)

And could you imagine, could you imagine had this gone the other way where an actual Man of God was held accountable? Like I know that they know that their establishment, their foundation that they stood on, if, if there was a Man of God to actually take some sort of accountability, I mean, the church would not be where the church is today. It wouldn't be this cult that it is today. This is, this is this moment. This is where I get really, really [infuriated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9734s) and it's just, it breaks my heart because the the account of its nature is literally why the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is the way that it is now and has such a high level of sexual abuse in every way, shape or form. And not even sexual abuse, but there's a spousal abuse, right? It's just to me, this was the pinnacle point that if they had just stopped [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9765s) taken accountability, we might have a somewhat form of mainstream Christian church.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9772s)

And I think the thing here is that the Brethren in Scotland and the Brethren in Aberdeen didn't just walk away from JTJr. and the Exclusive Brethren. They did try to follow the process of holding him accountable. They sent the tapes over because they're like, "JT Jr., he's a local in New York, therefore it's the New York Brethren who need to take responsibility for addressing this." And they sent the recordings over to New York and they sent letters explaining what had happened and they described in [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9802s) detail and left it with the Brethren of New York to take action against what JTJr. had done.

And this was sort of the, the acid test really for whether it was possible to hold an Elect Vessel accountable. And the Brethren of New York tried, and there was massive conflict in the New York meeting about whether they could hold JTJr. accountable.

So, we'll just pick up the book describing this;

“The Brethren of New York were responsible for investigating and enforcing Assembly judgment, but censoring the elect vessel proved beyond them. He thumbed his nose at them, turning up drunk to meetings in the weeks following the Aberdeen incident as a New York elder recounted in a letter. ‘At the ministry meeting, Mr Taylor appeared barefoot, sat ultimately clowning and dozing during the hymn, prayer and words.’ The brewing storm caught the attention [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9860s) the press when Big Jim brazenly invited Madeline Ker and her husband to visit him in New York a few weeks after the Aberdeen encounter.

A Daily Express reporter was dispatched to ask the Exclusive Brethren leader for his version of events. Madeline and the elect vessel were found together at his house in Brooklyn, their respective spouses nowhere to be seen. Big Jim was in an armchair clad only in underwear. He didn't seem bothered to have been disturbed in a state of undress, joking to the reporter that he'd better put some trousers on. ‘But quite honestly, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9890s) find it more comfortable just sitting in my underpants."’

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9894s)

This stuff is mind-blowing. I still find it astonishing that you can look up this photograph from this interview and that it's got those classic things like the whiskey and the Bible.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9911s)

“As the elect vessel denied having done anything improper, ‘Absolutely nothing happened in that bedroom that Mrs. Ker and I are ashamed about.’ He sat on the couch and posed for an astonishing photograph. He looked disheveled with a glass of whiskey in his right hand and a large leather-bound Bible resting on his lap. He draped his left arm around Madeline's shoulder, resting his hand on her breast, and kissed her lightly on the cheek. ‘I don't care what people say,’ he told the reporter, ‘she is a very, very pure [person.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9941s)’ This picture and the accompanying article were the final straw for many Exclusive Brethren in Europe and North America who were already hearing from friends and relatives who had witnessed Big Jim's behaviour in Aberdeen.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9957s)

This is important. The reason why this is important is not only because that it's this filthy skeleton in the Brethren's closet, but it's because, you know, to be honest, the same thing today, again, different clothing perhaps on the outside or whatever, you know, metaphor you want to use, but a similar thing could happen in the Brethren now. A similar thing could happen with the current elect vessel is that he's caught without his underpants on, so to speak. And again, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=9987s) as we know, a similar crisis could happen where, you know, two sides form, one where people go, "Hang on a minute, where are the witnesses, where are the facts, what's going on here? Perhaps this isn't what we see."

And where the spin doctors kick into operation, where the Elect Vessel, gasp, might even lie. You know, the page before, you describe how the Brethren in New York and around the place challenged him with the recordings where he kept saying [bum,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10017s) bum, boob, tit and stuff. And where he, he tried to lie and say, "Oh, the recordings were a fake." And yet, you know, there wasn't enough time or the equipment in that day to actually create a fake in that manner. And the Brethren who knew him listened to it and said, "Well, no, it is clearly your voice."

So quite on top of all of this sexual immorality, he's lying and being caught red-handed lying. And I just want to zero in on that stuff because I'm like, people, this could [happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10047s) again. You know, it might not. Maybe Bruce Hales really is the Christ, but maybe he's not. And maybe he too could lie. And I've been told that for a couple of decades now, that in Bruce's ministry, he's been teaching the Brethren and saying things like, "Are we prepared for another ambush? And will the Brethren stand with me when there's another ambush?" And so he's, in a way, I think, why on earth is he preparing them for an ambush? Has he got something to hide? Is [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10077s) worried there's going to be a crisis? Is he worried there's going to be a test of his leadership?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10084s)

This is why Aberdeen is still, after 54 years, still such a massive thing for the Brethren. It's not just about JTJr. being a filthy old perv, although I think it's pretty clear that he was looking back. But this really gets to the heart of whether you are prepared to acknowledge the truth of what happened. And it's why Bruce Hales keeps coming back to, if [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10115s) another Aberdeen, are you, you know, are you ready to stand with the truth? And 25% of the Exclusive Brethren worldwide left over Aberdeen. But massive, massive numbers. It was thousands and thousands of people.

And starting in Scotland where almost everybody left and then you got further and further out. And it was the people who had been there or the people who had friends and family who were there or the people who got letters from people who were there. And the Brethren in Aberdeen tried to explain what had happened and they wrote, the other thing is that the recordings of Aberdeen went to Stow Hill, I think it was called then, the precursor of the Bible and Gospel Trust. So all of the recordings of meetings got sent in to the Bible Trust to be printed as ministry.

And the Aberdeen recordings got sent in to the Bible Trust. And it was Rebecca Stott's [father,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10183s) of course, who was running the Bible Trust at that point. But the people at the Brethren's own Bible Trust responsible for printing the ministry listened to the recordings from Aberdeen, which they had been sent to turn into ministry, and said, "Hey, something's not right here."

And it was the Brethren's own ministry depot that printed the transcripts of Aberdeen and everyone's letters and said, "Hey, we're not making a judgment call here on whether JT Jr.'s behavior was okay, but here's the ministry from Aberdeen and here's everyone's letters and we're just publishing this as a standalone white book so that you can all make up your own minds about what happened [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10232s) Aberdeen." And this was the Brethren's own Bible Trust putting out an own, like a version of their own ministry to the Brethren and that was banned.

And that issue of the white book was taboo for Brethren and Brethren were told to destroy it without opening that white book. And you know, there were families who ceremonially burned that white book in their backyard to show what a [judgment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10262s) they had. And it's like, but this was exactly the process that the ministry is supposed to follow. The recordings get sent to the depot, the depot prints and the depot sends them to everyone. So why can't people read this one?

And still, for anyone who's interested, this white book that was put out is still available online. If you want to know what was said, you can look it up, you can go and read it. And at that point, for anyone who was found to have read it, you were instantly withdrawn from.

Unbelievable way, unbelievable cancellation of attempts to cancel the other narrative. Yeah. And you're just making me think, it's, it's obviously not anywhere near as such a big scale, but just a reminder as well that the Brethren continue to redact ministry and to redact things that were said that later on they become embarrassed about or, yeah, that they don't want to be kind of immortalized in ministry in print. And I think for example of the so-called poison ministry that Bruce Hales said about my brother Braden Simmons, which has been talked about on this podcast, on Get a Life podcast, possibly with an interview with Brayden or I might have talked about it in previous interviews.

But as an example of that, you know, that ministry where Bruce Hales inquired about the fastest way to kill yourself and you know, appeared to be saying that it was better for Braden to kill himself than to have contact with an outsider. It appears that that's, you know, those are the parallels he was drawing because he had an extended discussion about it about rat poison, that the fastest way to kill yourself would be arsenic or rat poison. That stuff was printed in white books and distributed all around the world to every Brethren household. And then it hit the [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10385s) and the media and the ex-Brethren community, who there was an uproar.

And oh, lo and behold, when when those meetings were printed in the more hard copy of Bruce Hales's ministry, oh, all of the poison ministry references had mysteriously disappeared and you would never know that they're there if you take that book off the shelf. "Oh, there's no such thing as poison ministry. No way, that was never said." And yet those white books still exist. People, we know this was said, we [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10415s) it happened.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10416s)

And if you look at the, if you look at the white book version versus the proper, you know, the later official ministry version, there's like four or five pages that have just disappeared of Bruce Hales's ministry. And it's like, well, he's either God's voice on earth, he's Christ, he can do no wrong, therefore everything he says is God's voice, or it's possible he fucked up and we just need to get rid of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10443s)

And I mean, they truly believe in there though that he should be allowed to edit his ministry the way he wants to. And going back to Aberdeen, so he's brought that up a lot recently, is Aberdeen's being brought up again. So he knows, I mean, it was very heavily brought up after we did all those Aberdeen podcasts, but it's coming up again since all this ATO raid has happened, right? Like he's always got this backup plan to be smoothing things over [while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10474s) chaos is happening.

And yes, now we've told, okay, he was supposed to have, they were supposed to have fellowship meetings in November that it was cancelled because he's having knee surgery. I guarantee you there is no knee surgery happening. I guarantee you he's dealing with his ATO situation. Like there's just, there's just always just such a way where he smooths things over, gathers the empathy that he needs from the people and from his followers and keeps moving on. But I do believe, I do believe he's walking towards his, his canyon that he's going to fall into.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10518s)

Interesting. And oh my gosh, well that, you know, read the bottom of page 145\. Just wrap up the...Yeah. Yeah, read the bottom of page 145, Craig, because it's just so relevant.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10529s)

Yes. So I had started asking questions about Aberdeen because I'd Googled it and found the picture of JT Jr. and we were in Wollongong for fellowship meetings with Bruce Hales and we're talking to, about whether we could advertise in the Yellow Pages. This was me and Dad;

“Our conversation with the man of God was uneventful and Dad was pleased to get special permission to advertise in the yellow pages again. Then, as the Man of God manoeuvred into the front passenger seat of a waiting [vehicle,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10560s) Dad threw him an unexpected question. ‘Mr. Bruce, could you say something to set Craig's mind at rest about Aberdeen?’

I was mortified. Having doubts about Aberdeen was bad enough, but to have them revealed out of the blue to the man of God was so much worse. His reply was succinct. ‘What it comes down to is the absolute folly of ever doubting the man of God in the first place.’"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10583s)

And that is how he keeps control of 55,000 plus members.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10591s)

"The absolute folly of ever doubting the man of God in the first place." Wow. The scene is set, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10604s)

Right. And they all believe. Well, I mean, not all of them. Some are waking up. A lot of them are waking up in there. A lot of them. Yeah. Wow.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10615s)

Yeah. So that takes us to the end of chapter seven.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2yp5pGSZIk&t=10617s)

Mm-hmm. So we're going to end here and Craig and Lindy are going to join us again and pick up where Craig begins his journey of leaving.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
