## Summary

Anna Simmons lived her whole life in the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC, but never agreed with their harsh doctrine of separation. She was unable to leave because of her family, but spent years having secret contact with relatives on the outside. In one letter, she said she had “felt trapped for most of my life”, and she also said she felt like a “prisoner of hope”.
Many people who have left or are thinking about leaving the PBCC will relate to this quote from Anna: "CAN I continue where I am, wearing the mask of conformity, and rebelling within?"
Anna died last week, aged 85, the day Bruce Hales arrived in New Zealand for the infamous Palmy Party. It was bad timing for the Brethren! You see, Anna was the grandmother of Lindy Jacomb and Braden Simmons, and the great-aunt of Craig Hoyle - three of the biggest “opposers” in New Zealand these days. So what was going to happen at her funeral?
In this surprising podcast, Lindy and Craig reveal how the Brethren compromised on all of their usual burial rules, and even allowed a completely “worldly” funeral service to be held for her in a non-Brethren chapel. Here at Get A Life we’re hopeful that this sets a precedent for how Brethren funerals will be conducted in the future. Have a listen! We also give a Palmerston North update!

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=6s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. We are joined today with Carman and again, our very special guests, Lindy and Craig. We have an exceptional good news podcast today from Craig and Lindy in regards to new funeral changes that happened for them that they're going to dive into but first we want to give a Palmerston North update.

So [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=37s) have received quite a few emails and messages from insiders regarding how they're going to recoup the cost of this Palmy party that happened and I'm going to let Carman dive into some of the numbers to let everyone know what kind of money Bruce Hales may make off of this. Go ahead Carman.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFtFJ4ELDg3I%26t%3D61s)

Well it's kind of funny because we've got such a large variety of different reports this time. Sometimes when you get a report you just get 10 more reports of the same thing and this time it appears like they're being a little bit creative. So the initial reports that we got, we got from sort of UK, Canada, Australia, not right in New Zealand.

And it's been reported that at the care [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=91s) a letter was read and they're expecting worldwide, the brethren to pay $20 per head to cover the cost of this special midweek fellowship meeting in Palmerston North. So when you figure that out, you can guesstimate there's 50 some thousand people at $20 a head, you will get a couple million dollars.

Well, then interestingly, the [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=121s) has come out of Palmerston and New Zealand area. And in New Zealand, if you attended the Palmy party, you are going to be invoiced an extra $100 per head to cover your subsidized travel to Palmerston North. So if you guesstimate around 8,000 visitors went to the Palmy party, that would be another $800,000. So close to about $3 million intake [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=151s) the Palmy party in total.

So then we got to thinking, gosh, that seems like a lot of money for a two-meeting Palmy party because it literally was two meetings. It was one meeting on Wednesday and one meeting on Friday. Zero meetings on Thursday.

And so we started thinking about security costs and estimates at about $120,000. Private jet chartered from Sydney to Wellington up to somewhere in the ballpark of Palmy and then a vehicle cavalry to escort the Mogpog into Palmerston North. I mean that's right well the charter jet the estimate was about $70-75,000 [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=200s) then of course all the vehicles security at about $120,000.

The bill from Vendemia, we had an insider that actually witnessed the bottle list and the bill from Vendemia and for the two days it was over $100,000 and then there would be the food cost but even when you add all those up and sort of throw in a few incidentals that only comes to about $600,000. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=231s) we're just kind of assessing and thinking about that he's going to take in close to $3 million and we have identified about $600,000 outgoing. I wonder where the extra $2.4 million is going. Any ideas Craig?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=247s)

What an absolute rort. That sounds like an absolute rort from what you're saying. That's unbelievable. I can't work out why the average Joe and Jane blogs in there isn't doing this math and asking some questions. Shouldn't charitable institutions and church entities have complete financial transparency? Is anybody on the inside asking where this money's going?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=274s)

Well an interesting part is even if you didn't personally attend the meeting, so you're not personally paying for your part of the Palmy party or the subsidized travel, if you watched it on Zoom you are expected to pay your $100 invoice as well. So even the pregnant and elderly people that stayed in the Auckland meeting room and watched it by Zoom, even they don't get a break. They get a $100 [invoice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=304s) for having the honor of watching the Palmy party.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=308s)

Oh my gosh, that is shocking. You know what, the brethren and other people around the rest of the world absolutely ridicule and rubbish kind of the televangelist type people who appear to be in religion for the money, or the people who say that there's, you know, you've got to come and give your tithe up the front or give money up the front of the stage or whatever. We mock and ridicule those Christians who do that and yet it appears that Bruce Hales is doing [exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=339s) the same thing.

He's just doing it under a Trojan horse, right? Of saying, "Oh, here's a conference that by the way you didn't get to choose to come to this or not, you were told to come to it." But and then afterwards, you know, here are these bills and you have to pay for that privilege. That that's just a rule.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=358s)

And then you'll pay for the privilege all over again when you have to pay for the white book. Yeah, and I mean and even in their care meeting on Saturday, well the care meeting notes and recording we received, all the money that went out in that care meeting at that locality all went back into Bruce Hales's pocket. It was either through a trust or through the Palmerston North, nothing went out to anybody else.

Everything funneled back into Bruce Hales's pocket. So I mean he may have [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=393s) put on a good show, there might have felt what felt to be like this huge relief of a party, but in the end everybody pays for it and then some.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=405s)

Wow, to clarify what you're saying Cheryl, in the good old days when we used to go to a Maple Creek care meeting, there might be $2,000 that gets dispersed, but generally that would get dispersed to probably 15 to 20 different people or money pots, just call them money pots. Whatever you know, different causes or or or relief funds or whatever they go to. So you could take $20,000 and split it 15 or 20 different ways.

The most [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=436s) care meeting, the particular one that we were told about, there was about $4,500 to be spent and the initial chunk went straight to Bruce Hales. Then the next chunk went to the Palmy party, and then the next chunk went to the all-man meetings in Sydney in December. And then the next chunk went to the Grace Trust, and the next chunk went to the Vision Trust. And by the time the $4,500 was dispersed, all money went actually back [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=466s) one source. And that's the picture that we're trying to compare for you how times have changed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=475s)

Yeah, and we should let the viewers and listeners know a care meeting is the first Saturday of the month where each locality, so each place, city, town, sits down and disperses their money that they've collected from everybody for the month. So it could go to other different priests or heavies, whatever you want to call them, and in this case everything went back to Bruce is what we're referring to.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=499s)

Right, right. So normally it's collectively decided where is this money going to go, although when I say collectively decided, from my memory as well it did appear to have already been written down or a certain kind of agreed amount was already actually agreed upon. And it was very uncommon for someone in that congregation to contest or or challenge or change where that money was going.

And also, I mean we [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=529s) don't need to go into all the detail now, but like I'm just assuming there's other overlap and giving happening not just at the care meeting, right? Like people have already in New Zealand, those people have already paid their hundreds or thousands of dollars for their flights and transport. That's already been paid separately.

And people are already in their monthly regular outgoings already paying money to entities connected to Bruce Hales such as UBT. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=560s) this care meeting giving's additional, right, to those other kinds of ways and means of expenditure. Yeah, you have to do a podcast another day digging into this stuff a bit more because I think it's shocking and I think that people need to be asking for far greater transparency over where this money's going and how it's being spent.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=579s)

And I think it's extraordinary to think, like if, and Lindy this is probably a question for you, when you think of money that comes into a church, it's your tithes, it's your offering. And most churches, I mean there would be the general operating expenses or whatever, but you wouldn't think of that money being used for a party, a booze party, a food party. You know, that's not just generally a church, you can't really think of a Christian church doing that. Am I off base here?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=608s)

Yeah, it's not activity that I've heard of a mainstream church doing, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=614s)

On a technical point, the care meetings are on the Saturday before the first Sunday of the month and so this most recent care meeting was on Saturday the 30th of September.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=625s)

Right, thanks. Weird. Weird that is true. And in that care meeting was new rules that were laid out too and I wish that I don't have the letters right in front of me right now regarding some new rules that Bruce was laying out. Well actually it didn't come from Bruce, it was concerned elders again regarding trade shows. What else was on there Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=651s)

Not staying in motels and not going to places where there's no brethren.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=656s)

That's actually a bit upsetting to hear for me because trade shows are a really, really important business networking and sales and marketing opportunity. And I'm really confused about why Bruce Hales or why the concerned Universal Elders would disallow something that would directly contribute to making businesses more successful.

Why do you think that they are not allowing trade shows? Is that because [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=687s) also heard that there are often trade shows in locations without brethren and people are going and staying in motels to attend and having a holiday?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=694s)

So it was becoming, so in this letter it was talking about like you can still go to trade shows but they have to be absolutely necessary, right? So I mean from what we had heard was that people were using them as holidays, right? People were out having fun like they should, right?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=713s)

Right, because it's great. It was the only valid option to have a holiday. Again for viewers and is not familiar with the brethren, you are not allowed to go on holiday in the brethren. Like you categorically can't even go away on an overnight camp because you might miss one of the meetings that evening that you're meant to go to. Like you can't go to to Ibiza or you know California or wherever your holiday destination of choice might be. You're not allowed to have leisure off.

And so I guess what I'm hearing you [guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=743s) say is that, I mean I remember back in there, the only way you could travel would be if you came up with a business excuse. Like I remember our family wanted to go and visit our relatives who'd been moved to Argentina and the brethren, but again you couldn't just go and see your family members because they were your family members. Dad had to come up with a business investigation opportunity in Argentina in order to take us. So I'm guessing that's what they've done is that people have used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=774s) business trade show thing to enable them to visit all sorts of countries.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=778s)

It was a break and they are enacting the Orbit there. So if you do need to go to a trade show, it will have to be approved. So they did talk about approving things through the Orbit, through Orbit. So Orbit is their app that if you need to go somewhere you've got to put all your information in it. Obviously goes to a heavier priest in that locality and they have to approve it. So the Orbit was mentioned in the letter.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=802s)

What if you just book regular flights with an airline yourself? Is that not allowed now either?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=806s)

No, all travel plans must go through Orbit and they must be approved by an elder in your locality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=813s)

Yeah, to me it was like this, we talked about last last podcast about the push pull that Bruce does, right? So he goes to Palmy, has this huge party and then literally care meeting the the weekend after I guess it would be, right, is or the care meeting after that he pulls right back. So this is a classic cult move, classic leadership move by a cult leader, right?

I feel bad for those people that get stuck in that or don't see it and just get thrown on this roller coaster ride of this push pull, push pull, I'm giving, I'm taking away, I'm giving, I'm taking away. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=857s)

And another quick warning for all of our watchers and listeners, when you have a Zoom meeting and you are watching it on your UBT computer or you're zooming in on your TV, remember it is tracking your location. So you can't go camping and take the computer with you or the TV with you. It tracks where you're watching the Zoom meeting from.

And a lot of people have got busted and are in a lot of trouble because they did not realize [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=887s) Life360 is tracking them wherever they go. So if you are being a very good peeb and you're watching your Zoom meeting but you're watching it at the campsite, that's a no-go because it knows you're out there camping and having fun and that's not allowed. It's so 1984, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=906s)

And they have to, they really do track it. Like we had, Carman posted that one insider that sent us a message, they track you. They have phones that are under review and under surveillance. So yeah, anyhow, I'm going to let Lindy and Craig kind of join in on what else was going on right before this whole party had started. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=937s) yeah, go ahead, Lindy, explain to the listeners and viewers of what you guys were experiencing when this was all going down.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=946s)

Yeah, wow. Shoot, where to begin, Craig? Actually, I'm going to jump right back and set a little bit of a scene here. So yeah, we would love, Craig and I would love to share today about a wonderful woman called Anna Simmons, who was my nana and who was Craig's great aunt.

So yeah, she was a wonderful woman who had spent most of her life in the Exclusive Brethren Church and had married a man in there, but she'd actually only joined when she was 11\. And I'll let Craig share a wee bit more about that because he is a fabulous historian especially of family lineage and history and that type of thing. So actually Craig, I'll let you do a little bit of that same setting and then I just want to talk briefly about the letter I sent to the brethren a year ago before we head [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1001s) yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1002s)

Yeah, so Anna was my great auntie, as Lindy said. My grandpa George was her younger brother and they came into fellowship in 1949\. Their parents had both grown up in the Exclusive Brethren as they were then called but had both left as teenagers sort of in the 1920s and spent most of their lives out of the Exclusive Brethren and were very critical of the Exclusive Brethren.

[Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1032s) you read through their letters and through the 1930s they thought the Exclusive Brethren were a dead lifeless bunch, I think, were the words they used. But our great grandpa Elf was dying of cancer and the Exclusive Brethren basically love-bombed the family trying to get them back. And in 1949, they did come back into the Exclusive Brethren.

And the thinking from my grandpa in later years was that his father knew that the Exclusive Brethren for all their faults in the late 1940s, early 1950s were going to look after his widow and three children. [Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1075s) but what that meant is the three kids had this early life outside the brethren. And so Anna was 11 and my grandpa George was nine when they came back in. So very strange experience for these kids being backplied into this ultra conservative church, the Exclusive Brethren.

And so I think that's really important to understanding Anna is she had this independent childhood. She didn't have the brethren coming at her for [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1105s) first 11 years of her life. And so she never, just stop me when you want me to, when I've got you up to where you want to be, Lindy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1114s)

Yeah, no, that's good. Yeah, carry on.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1115s)

Hey, Min, when she was 11, then she was 13, her father died. And that, yes, so that's Anna with my grandpa George. And right through when she was a teenager, Anna never agreed with the Exclusive Brethren. She didn't want to be in the church. She thought they were harsh and uncompromising and unscriptural in some cases. And she had asked a lot of questions as a teenager.

Again, that's Anna and George together. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1154s) when she asked questions of the brethren, she was told that, well they compared her to the people who put Jesus on the cross. So asking questions as a teenager in the brethren, this was in the 1950s, meant that she was no better than the murderers who had killed Jesus Christ. And that wasn't enough to put her off.

And she could see that there was a split coming in the Exclusive Brethren in the 1950s. This is when JTJr. was going head to head with Cowell. And she had decided that Cowell was a nicer, more gentle version of the Brethren movement and that when the split came, she was going to go with Cowell because she didn't agree with James Taylor Jr. She thought that he was harsh and unkind and not representing what she saw as Christian principles.

And when the split happened, 1959, the infamous Central Hall meetings where doctrine of separation began to be set in place. She had backed herself into a bit of a corner because she'd fallen in love with Lindy's grandfather, Rob Simmons, and they had married in 1958\. And so when the split came in 1959, 1960, and her husband went firmly into the JT Junior camp, she had an agonising choice.

It was either her husband and their baby or her convictions. And she chose to [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1262s) swallow her doubts and she wasn't going to give up her husband and baby. And it was a fateful decision really, wasn't it Lindy? She decided to suppress her doubts and stay in the brethren for the sake of her family. This was in 1959, 1960, and that really set in train of what happened for the rest of her life really. Yeah, and Lindy can probably pick it up from [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1292s).

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1292s)

Yeah, yeah that, no that, thanks for sharing that Craig. It's so interesting we forget sometimes what our older parents or grandparents have been through in terms of what they've lived through with the movement. Yeah, like being there for those significant events like the bringing in of more extreme separation and and other kind of battles between leaders and the decisions that have gone along the way.

So Anna, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1324s) Anna continued to, as Craig has set the scene, Anna continued over the course of her life to have this this struggle, you know, that she was what I think the brethren would call an independent thinker. You know, and by that they simply mean somebody who thinks for themselves and who has, who doesn't just blindly, hook, line, and sinker accept whatever the elect vessel is saying.

So of course the brethren use a phrase like that in a very derogatory sense and associate it with, you know, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1354s) spiritual rebellion. But actually, arguably it is, it's a holy thing to do, it's a righteous thing to do. It's a person living, trying to live in and think and find, you know, Scripture says that people will stand to account for their own choices, you know, not for someone else's choices.

And I think that was the kind of thing how Anna viewed it was that she was, she had her own sense of integrity before who she believed God to be around what was right [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1384s) what was wrong. And for her, a key part of that was to honour her husband and her children and her commitments there, but for her that did not extend to just complete blind acceptance of everything that the leadership of the brethren said or did.

And of course, like many of people in her era, she was 85, many of our older people have seen huge changes and swings and roundabouts of what [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1414s) leadership have done and when they've enforced something and then years later turned around and said that they were sorry. All that kind of thing which must be very, very deeply destabilizing. I know it was, I know it was for Anna.

So, you know, she lived through lots of those horrific things that people have talked about like, you know, pets being suddenly banned, books being burned. Like she had a collection of Christian authors and Christian poetry books, things [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1444s) that and there came an edict at some point that all such books should be banned. And so to her great distress, her and Rob did do that along with photographs.

There an edict came out at some point around not having photographs, too many, you know, photographs of your children's school photos, things like that. And so she burned all of them in an effort to be diligent and to, you know, toe the line which and then in later years it was sort of said, "Oh no, you know, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1474s) don't need to do that anymore." And it was quite distressing for these people who have lived through these things and done irrevocable things like burning family photographs and photos of their children.

Anyway, I'm kind of, you know, getting a little bit off the path here but so yeah, Anna on the outside was a was a devout little woman. She, you know, had twinkly brown eyes and she was short in stature and she'd always wear a headscarf especially, you know, when she went out shopping and that [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1504s) of thing as you were meant to do. Like she was genuinely devoted. It wasn't something that she put on. She genuinely was a person who really wanted to honor her Christian faith. You can see her there in that photo with her husband Rob. And yeah, there's another photo of her there. George's, sorry, is that, who are those people, her mother and George?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1531s)

Yeah, so that's my grandpa George in the middle, Anna on the right and their mother, our great-grandmother Ruth on the left.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1538s)

Yeah, and so just a quick note as well, Craig may bring in this later, but George was excommunicated in his, was he in his 40s, Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1550s)

He was 40 in 1981\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1552s)

He was 40, he was excommunicated when he was 40 because he was disagreeing with where the brethren were going. He felt they were going away from a simple gospel and general Christian orthodoxy and going more and more into extremism and sort of idolization of a world leader. So we might, we've got, he's got, he'd written a letter to the Wellington assembly about that which we might be able to share because I remember when I read it I was shocked at how similar it was to the letter that I wrote Bruce Hales in 2008\.

It was like, wow, this letter was written decades [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1588s) and it was almost identical. It was really fascinating for me anyway. So yeah, so Anna, like Craig said, was devoted to her husband and her children and devoted to following God. And so she'd wear a headscarf and she would, you know, her and her husband dedicated thousands of hours to the brethren.

They ran and rostered all the break system and all the fellowship, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1619s) fellowship meeting and interchange system and things like that. They, yeah, they devoted themselves to serving the brethren. And she was a very faithful woman, but you know, she never lost that ability to think for herself and she also never agreed with extreme separation as the Exclusive Brethren hold it.

So, you know, she knew she had relatives on the outside who had never been in and she continued, like people she'd known as a little girl, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1649s) she continued to write to them over the years as the decades unfolded. And after I left, some of these people she wrote to, now women in their 70s and 80s, I managed to track them down or they tracked me down and some of them have given me bundles of letters that Anna wrote.

And in them she's pouring out her soul and her struggles with the extreme edicts of the brethren, but also her desire to keep, you know, looking after her family and to honor God. [So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1679s) so she, yeah, but all of this was unknown to those of us on the inside or mostly unknown anyway. There have been a few people who've told me they knew she kind of had this inner conflict. But, you know, for me growing up in the Brethren with her as my nana, I never saw all of that. I just saw a devout woman.

I mean, there are a few things looking back and I think, oh, okay, yeah. Like she was the first person to give me a non-Derby [translation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1709s) of the Bible. She gave me a New International Version translation of the Bible because she said, "You know, here, read this, it might help you to read something in more modern English that helps you to understand." And you know, I do recall that she had photos of, she's got a daughter out, Kate, and who has five children and she had photos of them not very hidden in her dining room up behind some other photos. They were hidden but they were not, you know, completely disappeared.

[Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1740s) so yeah, but she was a devout nana growing up and she would encourage us to read the Bible, she would encourage us to ask questions. Her favorite verse, I remember asking her what, you know, "What's one verse that you would give me to hang on to for life?" And she said, "God," it's in Hebrew somewhere, "God is a rewarder of those who seek him." So in other words she was like, "Seek, look, you know, and don't be afraid to do that and God will [meet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1770s) you there," which was kind of cool for me.

Anyway, I'm probably getting way off track here but oh yeah, so just again a bit more of how her story overlaid with mine and Craig's journey has been very similar was that, yeah, when I was, when I came to leave the brethren, I had questioned the leadership and also came to believe, came to realize I didn't believe in Bruce Hales as being the man of God and that kind of thing. I couldn't see it anywhere in scripture. Excuse me, got a bit of a cold.

And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1810s) was being made to leave my family home and I was devastated at the thought of losing my relationship with Anna because, yeah, she was a warm and loving, kind presence in my life. And her and her husband came around to say goodbye to me and I remember that I was like, I was sobbing. I was lying down and I was just sobbing and I remember I just couldn't bring myself to say goodbye to them. Like I just physically couldn't do it. I was distraught.

And she knelt down by me and whispered in my ear [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1840s) she said two things that I've just never forgotten. She said, "God is with you," and she said, "I will never cut you off." Well for an Exclusive Brethren person to say those things, it's shocking because every, bear in mind that everyone around me was saying the absolute opposite. Everyone around me was saying, "You're going to be dead and gone to us."

And like I actually had priests praying over me saying that God was not with me and saying that, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1870s) know, saying, "God, she's in Satan's clutches, open her eyes," you know, and all this type of thing. So to have my nana whisper the opposite and say, "You know what, God is with you," was so shocking to me. And for her to say, "I will never cut you off," I was so shocked because here was I thinking I was grieving the loss of her forever, that I would never, she would never talk to me again, all that type of thing.

So same with all my other relatives, for her to like whisper that to me so that others didn't hear, I was like, [okay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1900s) you know, what is this? And sure enough, so that was the year 2008 when I left. Sure enough, in the ensuing years, she secretly kept in contact with me. So she would use a calling card so that the number didn't show up on the phone bill. And she would ring me when her husband was out. And she would watch for his lights coming home in the driveway. And when she saw his lights, she would quickly hang up.

And she would also write to me and to others. And I'll shut up now for a minute and let Craig [share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1930s) a wee bit around what her relationship with him was like. But, yeah, the reason why we're giving our listeners this character sketch of this woman is because we're setting the scene to describe what happened in the funeral. Because she has just passed away. And we would like to share with you some really unprecedented circumstances that happened there. But, yeah, just a quick character sketch to describe to you who this fascinating lady was.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=1960s)

Yeah, my relationship with Auntie Anna was much the same as Lindy's and when I was a teenager I used to call her, you know, once or twice a week and we'd have these conversations that went for hours. And she was sort of full of advice and insight and all these interesting little details about life. You know, she'd always make time for you, wouldn't she? And you had her full attention.

And as I got older and started having doubts in the brethren, I don't even remember how it first came up. I just knew that Auntie Anna was one of the only people in my life that I could share my doubts with without being judged for them. And so I would tell her what I thought about the brethren and over the course of time she started opening up with what she thought of the brethren, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2012s) was a huge risk. And by this point she's a great-grandmother in her 60s or 70s, a massive risk to be telling a teenager what your doubts in the brethren are.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2023s)

Because that's fascinating to me because she never shared any of those with me. Like she was accused of that after I left, my family accused her of influencing me, but we had never had those conversations that you're talking about. We hadn't, we hadn't had those. It wasn't till the day I left that she showed me that glimmer. So it's intriguing, but you left what, six months after me or something?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2045s)

I left, I left after Lindy and I think a lot of the conversations I had with Anna were after Lindy had left and Auntie Anna and I were reflecting on Lindy having left and what we thought about it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2057s)

Right.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2058s)

And it was very much, and I was talking about leaving at this point as well, and Auntie Anna was very, very much coming at it from the point of view of, "I wanted to leave when I was a teenager and it's far too late for me now, but it's not too late for you."

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2072s)

Wow.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2072s)

And this was, this was unheard of coming from, you know, someone your grandparents' age. She should have been trying to get me to stay in and she should have been pleading with me and begging me not to go out into the world. And instead she was almost doing the opposite. Although she never told me that I should leave, but she's like, "Well, if you do leave, then this is how it would work and this is how this would go about and you know, you have got family on the outside, there's all of my cousins and you know, Lindy and her daughter Kate and so [on."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2102s)

So she was very practical about it. And lots of these conversations that made it clear that she was definitely not on the brethren's side. And the priests got wind of this. They got wind that she was talking to me and also that she was still in touch with Lindy. And I remember at one point she got a priestly visit for talking to me and I was still in the brethren at this point.

[Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2133s) but the priests went around and sat her down and ordered her to stop talking to me because they thought she was a bad influence. And it was, that was one of the things really that helped push me toward the exit. Like if there was one person who could have persuaded me to stay in the brethren, it would have been Auntie Anna.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2151s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2152s)

And the priest banned her from, or tried to ban her from talking to me. And it had the opposite effect. And as with Lindy, she was great at wiggling her way around the rules. And so the priest had sat down and, "You're not to call Craig anymore." And I was talking to her afterwards and she said, "Oh well, they've told me that I can't call you." And so, and my husband, Uncle Rob, you know, [he's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2183s) said the same thing. She's like, "Well, I've promised them that I won't call you, but I haven't promised them that I won't answer the phone if you call me."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2190s)

And similar with, at some point Rob found out that she was talking to me and banned her from doing that. And but I think again she would ring the people I lived with and she would say the same thing, "I haven't been banned from talking with you." So she would call the people I lived with and get an update on how I was doing from them and have a, you know, really lovely conversations with them as well.

So she found ways and like [again,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2220s) it's not because she wanted to be devious. She wasn't a devious person. It was a woman who was absolutely torn apart on the inside between her conflicting desires to care for and love human beings on the outside who she still felt that she had every right to to care for and love. That didn't need to suddenly stop because they had left the brethren. For her that strong, strong separation boundary just meant absolutely nothing, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2251s) both as a human being and as a Christian.

So yeah, it's not like she was, you know, yeah, trying to be this wicked rebellious person. She was trying desperately to find ways around these strict rules in a way that could like alleviate her conscience. And I get that, right? Like she drew a line at explicit lying, but she was comfortable if there were other opportunities presented themselves that weren't.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2277s)

Incredibly creative.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2279s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2281s)

And she hated it. She was living in such torment. Like she wasn't trying to deceive anyone, but she could not in good conscience cut us off. And I remember talking to her about going to the meetings when I was starting to not go to the meetings anymore. And she, that just wasn't an option for her because her husband, Uncle Rob, was like deeply dedicated to the brethren. And so you went to all the meetings.

And I remember her [telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2312s) me and it always stuck with me that she said she went to the meetings as little as she could and sat at the back and tried not to cry. And I just thought what a terrible, terrible, terrible position to be in at the end of your life. Like no part of her wanted to be at the Exclusive Brethren meetings and she had no choice.

And I think how many other older people must be in that situation because we know it's not just her. And I think of all the older people I have heard from since leaving and you know, their letters about how sad and lonely they are and how [now,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2353s) you know, they're in their 70s or 80s in the Exclusive Brethren looking back on everything that's happened and kind of having this moment, "What might have been? What would my life have been like if I had left when I was younger?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2366s)

Especially the generation that went through Aberdeen, right? Like that's, my heart goes out to those people that went and witnessed and felt what Aberdeen was like and how the Exclusive Brethren, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is sitting today. And they're, I mean, everybody's feeling those same anticipation of something like that happening. Yet these people who have, you know, devoted how many years of their life to this and sit on that same precipice that they experienced however [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2396s) years ago, it's gotta be hard for them.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2398s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah, there's, we've got a couple of, I mean there's so many letter excerpts from from Nana that we could share, but to share a couple, Craig, I've got a couple of those ones that you shared earlier here. She's, she said, this is in a letter to someone on the outside, "There is so much about our community that has troubled me greatly over the years. I have felt trapped for most of my life."

And yeah, she was writing to George at one point and she said, "[The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2429s) contact with you has renewed my hope and courage that our Lord will break these chains of thought that are binding, that have bound so many over the years. May you be freshly comforted in your lonely pathway, dear George." So this is her writing to her, yeah, her brother had been excommunicated and lost his wife and children, Craig's grandpa.

And she said, yeah, and another letter to one of her cousins on the outside who'd never been in, she said, "The [biggest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2459s) conflict over the years has been, can I continue where I am wearing the mask of conformity and rebelling within?" So yeah, it is a, it is a sad, it is a sad painting. And yeah, and yet she was a person who did, yeah, do her best to love and care for those around her.

And so many brethren and ex-brethren have sent me messages talking about [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2489s) love and genuine care for people when they came for the break or you know, that kind of thing. She definitely did her best where she was. And like a lot of older brethren people, she's got so many children. She had eight children, and most of those have gone on to have five or more children themselves. So she's got dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

And that was another conflict as well that I think a lot of people have, is they've got so many children and grandchildren on the inside that they feel responsible for. And [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2519s) they know they will lose if they dare to challenge this stuff. And so this, you know, the old adage, isn't it, faith, fear, and finances keeping people in the brethren. And I totally agree. I think for Nana it was largely family that was keeping her in the brethren and the other two things.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2536s)

I think the calculation as well for some people like Anna was that they could stay in the brethren and have secret contact with their family outside of the brethren, but if they were outside the brethren then all their family inside would definitely cut them off. So the only way to try and play both sides was to stay in.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2552s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah, so that's, you know, that's a little character sketch of who, of who Anna was. But then in the last few years she actually developed dementia and ended up getting put into a secure retirement kind of rest home complex that I hear these days is increasingly common for people to do with their elderly brethren members.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2583s) while this was sad on the one hand, the unexpected silver lining for me anyway, or those of us on the outside, meant that, you know, when she was at home living with her husband, we couldn't see her because she would, you know, she was forbidden from that. So there's one photo there, I don't know if you want, could you briefly, briefly bring it up of me as a young woman with Anna and she's got a headscarf on.

And so that, that picture, oh if [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2613s) jump back, oh sorry, it's, yeah that one. So that was me sneaking to visit Anna at her house when her husband was still working. That was when I got engaged because I wanted her to meet my fiance. And that was quite funny because she welcomed us into her home and gave us a cup of tea and she also gave us a USB stick with a whole lot of family photos on it.

And these are family members, these are family members I hadn't seen for years. So it was like really heartwarming for me, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2643s) really naughty of her, you know. But you can see her big twinkly eyes there. And if you jump to the one of her in the rest home with me and my children, yeah, so and so in that one there, that was us, I mean my kids visiting her in the rest home. And so that was, yeah, better, we didn't have to do this kind of sneaking to try and see her. We could just turn up to the rest home and go and see her.

And you can see in the corner there there's a pin board with a whole lot of photos on it. She had a number of these pin boards up around her room which obviously brethren relatives had put up and they were filled with photographs of her children and grandchildren. But the really sad thing obviously for someone like me visiting in there was that there were no photos of me or my kids and no photos of Kate, her other, nana's other daughter and her five children.

You know, none of those photos were anywhere to be seen, even though, you know, for years and while she was in the rest home, I continued to take photos in there and to write to her and give her cards and photos of my kids and that. But yeah, these pinboards were really hard the first time in particular I saw them because there were all these photographs of my relatives, my parents, my siblings, who I hadn't seen for over a decade by this stage.

And so, you know, I'm looking at the pinboards trying to recognize faces. There's young men who were kids when I knew them who have now got jawlines and, you know, wearing the brethren's shirts. There are lovely young women with babies who I've never been told the names of those children. And yet I know they must [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2743s) nieces and nephews. Like those pinboards were really hard to see.

And I've had multiple other accounts of former members telling me similar stories of leaving photos, leaving a scrapbook of their children on the outside and coming back, you know, the following month or whatever and it's just disappeared. So that was like distressing as well as wonderful to be able to go and see her and spend that kind of time with her.

About a year ago I started to think about what am I going to do if she passes away and my grandpa died as well and you know I was not notified or welcome to anything to do with seeing his body or saying goodbye to him and things like that just got me thinking about it. And I realized I have to, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2796s) want to kind of anticipate this and prepare for it.

And so I wrote a letter to my uncle and the brethren and I said, "If Anna gets sick," you know, I said, "Anna has kept in contact with me over the years, she didn't keep the separation. I love her, she loves me. If she gets sick, you know, and it looks like she's kind of heading towards her deathbed, I would really like to be notified so that I can come and say goodbye to her in person."

And then I thought, you know, stuff it, why not as well? I would like to request to attend the funeral service and the graveside ceremony. And I know that normally brethren don't attend, sorry, ex-brethren don't normally attend the funeral service, but I thought, why not? They're supposed to be, I was saying they're a mainstream church now in many places around the world. I'm not actually 100% sure in New Zealand, but halls are supposed to be public places [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2853s) worship.

You know, I want to be notified and to be able to attend. And I was like, you know what, I'll be respectful. Oh, I'll wear a skirt or whatever. I won't shout out or do anything. I just want to be able to be there as part of closing that chapter of Anna's life. So I wrote to them asking for this and I got no reply. Tried again a couple of times and they eventually did reply and they said, I don't have the wording in front of me, but they basically said, "You're not welcome."

And they said, "This [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2883s) only, this opportunity or this privilege is only open to people who are not opposed to the testimony and tearing our position down." Which I was quite surprised by because at that stage Olive Leaf Network was not launched and I was not doing anything to tear their position down. You know, like I, yes, I'd spoken to a couple of media journalists a couple of times, but you know, it's not like I'm going around planting [bombs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2914s) or inciting people out or anything.

I was like, this is ridiculous. I'm just a stay-at-home mom with my toddler and my baby. I'm honestly not that wicked. And yet here I was being banned from a funeral for being, for tearing the position down. So I asked them, "What do you mean? Can you elaborate?" And I got no reply. So that was the end of that. But then lo and behold, roll on, was it only last week? I'm already losing track of the time, Craig. Was it only last week, the Palmy thing? My gosh, yeah. All of a sudden, Wednesday morning, somebody got hold of my number who's on the inside in the brethren, not a relative, and sent me a message saying, "I've just heard that your nana's died. I'm so sorry." And it's like, whoa, okay.

So of course I immediately rang my dad who was excommunicated a couple of years ago, told him, he'd heard nothing. I told my auntie Kate who's on the outside, she had heard nothing. And so then we left with this weird thing of what do we do? Like do we contact them and ask what's happened [or,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=2982s) you know, do we sit tight and wait? And we decided we'd give them a few hours to contact us on in the hopes that they would.

And they did. By the end of the day, a bunch of hours later, sure, but they did contact us. They contacted my father and asked and told him that his mother had died. So then, yeah, my dad on behalf of us wrote an email back to them saying, "[We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3012s) would like to come and see her body, we would like to come to the funeral service, and we would like to attend the gravesite ceremony." And he as well said, "I've got no desire for conflict. It's just that she was loved by people out here on the outside and we want to be able to honor her."

And we believe that, he also quoted the faith and practice document because even though we're not in the UK, arguably there's a universal standard, right? Yeah, and it's got a [particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3042s) clause in there specifically for former members to be able to attend funeral proceedings. And yeah, at first my uncle just emailed back and said basically that just my dad could go and see her body and in the home and that's all.

And so dad sent back and said, "You know, no, we want more than that and it's not just me, there's a whole bunch of us." And so then we heard nothing for like [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3073s) days because you know, the party is sudden is rolling out as well. So you know, Anna chose a funny time to die, didn't she Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3087s)

Literally, yes. Maybe she heard Bruce Hales was arriving in the country. She's like, "Nah, nah, I'm out."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3092s)

I'm out of here. Yeah. So it was literally Wednesday morning that she died, which is exactly when all of the brethren all over the country were mobilising to get to Palmerston North. So it was quite funny timing. And also, Craig, do you want to just share briefly, because I do think this might be part of the piece, about you doing a media piece and the brethren being very aware that that was about to hit the papers?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3119s)

Well, I mean, they're always super aware of public attention when these things are happening and they had had, not just me, they had had journalists asking questions of what was going on. So I suppose from their side there's a quite a high chance that anything that went badly at a funeral that happened before the weekend was going to end up in whatever stories were written.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3141s)

Yes, and especially given that you were Anna's great-nephew and you are a senior journalist in the New Zealand media scene.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3159s)

I think, like when you look at the outs that were connected to Anna, it's people like me and Lindy and Lindy's brother Braden of rat poison fame. Like all of the people in New Zealand that have caused the most trouble for the brethren in recent years are somehow connected to Anna. And so this was like a highly volatile, potentially, situation for them and they couldn't really afford to get it wrong because it could have just blown up in their faces.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3188s)

Yeah, you're, I think you're right. I think you're right. So yeah, over those three days, you know, we're sitting here waiting to hear, are we allowed to go and see Anna's body? And at the same time we're getting all these reports rolling in about this conference happening in Palmerston and you know, we heard reports that Bruce Hales had preached on care and compassion and we were like, "Oh my gosh, are we gonna see this put into practice? Are we gonna receive caring compassion or not?"

You know, and we were trying to figure [out,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3218s) yeah, is this gonna apply to us? Why did Bruce preach on caring compassion?

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3226s)

He probably didn't know at that stage that Anna had died, but it's like, brilliant, I'm glad you preached on this. Now let's give you an opportunity to put it into practice. And yeah, and Craig was preparing those articles. He wrote them. And so he had contacted Doug Watt himself, who's a brethren elder, for media statements. So they knew that Craig was about to release these articles.

And yet we have no doubt that they were highly concerned that he might write something negative about them, connected with perhaps a funeral. But yeah, so we're sitting and waiting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3266s) these, you know, the days are going past and I'm going, "Do I book flights to Auckland?" Kate's daughter's in the South Island and all her children, "Do they book flights?" Like, you know, we were trying to figure out what to do.

And then I decided to book flights anyway, regardless of what might happen. And I was glad I did because all of the flights were sold out anyway, I think, and the airports were crawling with brethren for the conference. Like there was a heavy load on the airlines. There were like literally several thousand people [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3296s) of a sudden going, including a bunch of them going through my local airport in Wellington.

So, yeah, booked flights and then at 5:30 p.m. the night before the funeral on Friday, an email came through from the brethren relatives saying, "We have booked an hour in the cemetery chapel for you to spend with Anna's body." And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3327s) they said, "We will move the body into the graveside area and then you can have some time there alone."

So again for the viewers and listeners who aren't familiar with this, with what normally happens, what normally happens when someone dies on the inside and their outside relatives, the outside relatives are not allowed to attend the funeral at all. That's held in a brethren meeting hall. And it used to be, when I was in anyway, that everyone had to come to the funeral.

So whether you were at a business, or whether you were at the school, you would don your headscarves and your meeting attire, and you would come to the brethren hall for that funeral service. And then a significant number of people would also attend the graveside ceremony. And it was, outsiders were allowed to come to the graveside ceremony usually, but they were always had to stand at [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3386s) distance.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3386s)

And not so much allowed as it's a public place and they couldn't physically stop you from showing up. Although, although they used to, they would, they would get devious and they would tell the outs that the funeral, they were going to be at the gravesite at 2 p.m. and then you'd show up at 2 p.m. and it would have been and gone. "Oh, I've got moved to 10 a.m. Did nobody tell you? Oh, we're really sorry about that."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3409s)

Yeah, yeah, you're exactly right Craig. There's multiple, multiple harrowing stories of people being buried and only telling their family members, only telling the relatives after the fact. Yeah, and devious, there's multiple stories of, yeah, funeral times being shifted, things like that. And it seems like it has all been intentionally done to stop outsiders participating at all.

And yeah, you're probably completely right that it's not so much that they were [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3439s) you can come to the gravesite, it was, yeah, they couldn't stop outs from coming and standing at a distance. But it's, there's some really sad stories out there, really hard of people who have, yes, are forced to stand at a distance while they watch a parent or a loved one be buried and they're just completely held at a distance and made to feel like, made to feel like, you know, horrible reject sort of thing.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3466s)

When my great-grandmother Hoyle died, there was a punch up over her grave because she had six children in the brethren and four children out. And when all of the outs tried to come through to pay their respects, they were blocked by the brethren and it ended up in a physical altercation, which is like such, such a disrespectful way to send off someone that you love.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3488s)

That's so disgusting. Oh my gosh, there are some really hard stories, eh? Absolutely heartbreaking. Like this, this area of funerals is, is really, yeah, there's some some real extreme behavior being shown by the brethren over the years and a lot of pain, a lot of damage caused. A lot of people who still feel a huge amount of hurt.

Yeah, so to kind of put that into context, for us to receive this email was absolutely unprecedented. For the brethren to actually [allow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3519s) outsiders to be alone with a body and to be able to have some time with her. And for them to leave the body in a secular funeral chapel is totally unheard of as well. And also for us to be allowed time alone at the graveside before the grave was closed, that's, that's like unheard of, unheard of.

Yeah, if it has been, if outsiders have been allowed to step forward, it's still been under the close [supervision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3549s) of brethren, whereas what they were saying to us was, "You know, you can do this and we're not going to be there." You know, in retrospect, it's quite funny because there's some aspects of it that sort of make me laugh because I'm kind of like, "Actually, maybe, maybe that's just because they didn't want any of their beloved people or their children to see us, or to even come near us."

Because, you know, they believe we're so poisonous that they probably believe if they stood downwind from us they [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3579s) catch some immoral influence or, you know, that if they came close they might see my little horns that are growing out of my forehead.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3588s)

Or I thought as well, like they wouldn't want anyone who is still in the brethren hearing us talking about how strongly Anna disagreed with the system. Yeah, because I think that would be news to a lot of them.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3602s)

That's such a good point. And actually now that I think about it, like even things like praying and sharing scriptures and talking about Anna's faith, like for them, they don't want, Bruce Hales has taught multiple times, multiple times, that if you leave you cannot retain your Christian salvation and that you're going to lose your soul and things like this. Whereas, you know, so there was about, in the end, there was about a dozen people who managed to make it at such short notice to this chapel time with Anna.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3633s) of them, a bundle of them were Christians. They were, yeah, these older women who had been secretly writing to Anna for years. There were other former members who were relatives like myself and Craig and my father. There were, there were others too who, and others who sent through messages who, like there was one couple who she had had a long friendship with, who she had just made, made friends with them after bumping into them in a supermarket.

And they'd struck up conversation with her and they were Christian and she had continued this letter writing friendship with them for years. And so they, they sent through messages to me too and they wanted to be there but they couldn't [make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3672s) it because of the short notice. But so I guess that's, that's another side of things that the brethren don't want to acknowledge is that there are people who are outsiders and who are former members who have still got a devout faith.

And I guess they don't want to hear people sharing those things and sharing because what we did then, we had this lovely chapel time with her and we, you know, we sung some of her favorite hymns. We sung "It Is Well with My Soul" and "What a Friend We Have in Jesus." People shared [reflections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3702s) about, you know, their treasured memories of her. People shared scriptures. It was like a really, really lovely time.

And then we were shuffled out to another room by the funeral director, a secular funeral director came and said, "Oh, the brethren want to move the body now." And so, and then they, the brethren, four men came in with their white shirts, for brethren [men,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3732s) we could see them from a distance. And a couple of them were relatives of mine and they took her body and went and obviously put it in the grave.

And so, so for again for the listener who might not be familiar with the brethren, the brethren only do full burials. They don't do cremation and that type of thing. They take that very seriously. So they, yeah, they've got to do the full burial thing. And so yeah, so they took her body and then just a few minutes later, not very long at all, we, dad got a text from them saying, "You can now go to the graveside." And so off we all went to the graveside. Craig, do you want to share about that?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3775s)

Yeah, it was the strangest, strangest thing because the brethren are very big on filling in the grave. You know, at a lot of non-Brethren funerals, people just throw some sand or soil into the grave and leave it at that. And the brethren have always been very insistent that they completely infill the grave. And so, like, highly, highly unusual for them to walk away and just leave a coffin sitting in a grave like this.

And I thought the other thing that was really [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3805s) was that the brethren didn't have a meeting room service for Anna's funeral. And they just held a service in the family home. And I wonder if that is because if they had had a meeting in a meeting hall and they had denied us access to that meeting, that would open them up to criticism. And so rather than run the risk of having outs show up at the funeral meeting, they'll just have no funeral meeting at all. And I thought that was quite strange. And to me, I wonder if it shows that they know that they are on shaky ground trying to deny outs access to funeral meetings.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3850s)

Yeah, and New Zealand's in the middle of a Royal Commission review right now, right? Or there was, yeah. Yeah, and the Royal Commission has spoken with dozens and dozens of former brethren about their, particularly the practice of separation and what that means for former members. And what we're hearing from people on the inside is that Bruce Hales is very worried about what this Royal Commission is going to find. So it wouldn't surprise me at all if they're on particularly high alert around some of these things because they know the Royal Commission is watching.

And I mean for this funeral to have, like we've got three pivotal key people, right? You've got Lindy who's, you've got the Olive Leaf Network, we've got Braden that has the history of the whole Bruce Hales town through the rat poison stuff, and then we have Craig who's a journalist. Like I think they knew that there was no way around getting around this in the Royal Commission review. There would have been no way. It [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3917s) have just sealed the deal for the Royal Commission to be able to come in and here's the perfect example of, you know, three very outspoken people and to be denied that.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3927s)

Yeah, well and the other thing is is that my father, so he's, you know, he hasn't gone public with his journey and I haven't actually checked off with him how much I can share, so I'll keep it really brief. But he was excommunicated only a couple of years ago and shut up for two years before that. And the only reason was because he challenged the brethren leaders in Auckland over their, some financial decisions that were made.

[Um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3957s) he believes under the direction from Bruce Hales and they were financial decisions that directly benefited Bruce Hales's Unispace company, I believe it was called at that point. So dad had challenged this stuff because he was a school trustee and that is why he got booted. And you know, I also actually think that even though he's never gone public with a story, I think that they are possibly quite concerned about his what he could share as well if he [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=3987s) he chose to.

And he also was a trustee of my, sorry, what do you call it? Yeah, he was still an executor of my nana's will that had not been taken off or changed. And one of the, you know, first clauses of the will said that her funeral should be conducted according to her executor's wishes. And so she had a brethren executor and then my dad. And so legally as well, they would have known that, you know, they couldn't [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4018s) override my dad's wishes here and completely cut him out.

So it seemed like, you know, there were multiple threads that led to the brethren allowing this for us. But yeah, as Craig said, it was, it was just so beautiful because we could spend time at the graveside. We were able to put flowers on. Normally the brethren don't allow flowers and do anything like that. They view that as just sentimentality. But we could sprinkle flowers down and, you know, we read the verse about, the [flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4048s) of the field fades but the word of the Lord endures forever and things like that.

You know, it's not just sentimental nonsense, it's symbolic of things and of things of faith. And then we got to, yeah, shovel the earth over her and to be there for the closing of the grave. Also, random piece of information for New Zealand brethren, see to the bottom right of the image there's tulips on a grave there. That grave is the grave of Darren Stanners who died in Auckland [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4079s) oh, at least a couple of decades ago.

And he was, I think he was only 16 when he suddenly died and it, you know, it was one of those young people dying that kind of shocks everybody and the leaders say that it's the Lord speaking and that type of thing. And unbeknown to us, another former member of the brethren had actually, who used to be friends with Darren as a young man, had visited Darren's grave the day before and placed that lovely bouquet of tulips. And this person has since contacted me to [say,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4109s) "Oh look, you know, I can see Darren's headstone in the corner of your pictures there," which is funny because the brethren all bury themselves next to each other.

But yeah, so I guess like, you know, it was bittersweet, wasn't it Craig? Because on the one hand it felt so fitting that this woman who didn't cut us off in life also, you know, we weren't able to be cut off completely in death. And that I think Anna would have 110% agreed with it [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4139s) loved to have loved, loved that we weren't forced out at the end.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4146s)

And I think she would have loved that she didn't have a brethren meeting either.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4150s)

Yeah, given what you shared earlier about her sitting in the meetings crying. And oh, their funeral services were awful. Like they would never share about the person. They were very depersonalized, wouldn't they? It was more, you know, you would read some scripture or talk about death or something, but it was never allowed, like the brethren are very against sentimentality or emotion or even grieving.

Like I remember one time seeing a friend [crying,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4180s) sobbing loudly after a friend of ours had died and she was like told off by a priest, like absolutely shut down for like showing so much emotion. It was seen as, yeah, so their funerals were awful. And I think Anna would have loved the service that we had for her. But yeah, I do want to also acknowledge that even though for us it felt like a celebration in some ways, I want to acknowledge how absolutely screwed up it is that there were [dozens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4210s) and dozens and dozens of other of our direct family members, our parents and his other children, our cousins who were nowhere to be seen at their nana's graveside ceremony.

You know, that is weird. Like there's a part of me that's sad that they missed out on that. They for some reason, none then came and wanted to be present at a graveside ceremony. Like that's weird and that breaks my heart as well. Like it's, you know, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4241s) actually, it's actually still not okay. It's actually still really, really, really screwed up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4248s)

Do you think that due to her beliefs about the brethren and the secret contacts she kept in touch with people, if they knew about that, do you think that was another reason why they maybe never gave her the burial that they would have normally given? Could have been, eh Craig? I mean it's just speculating here, but that's been running through my head as you guys have been speaking that you know, if [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4279s) had, if they knew about these letters, if they knew about this contact that she was keeping.

And I mean it's just odd that they would hand the body right over to you and like let you do the feeling of the grave and everything. Like it's, yeah, it's really strange. Part of me gets this feeling like, "Well, she was kind of already one foot out, let's just have this and we're also scoring some brownie points with the Royal Commission in doing this, but you know, she was already partial [worldly."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4309s)

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4309s)

I've just thought of something. We've heard about them posthumously restoring people into fellowship. Have you heard about that? Like sometimes people have died out and then the brethren have then like been like, "Oh crap, we got that wrong. We should never have destroyed that person." Yeah, yeah. "Oh, we're gonna restore them." We've heard of them being brought back, the judgment being reversed publicly in the assembly and then that person being posthumously brought back into fellowship, which is completely bonkers.

But I [guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4339s) it gives the family some comfort because all of a sudden they can put their photographs back up on the wall of their father or whatever. But I'm just cracking up, Craig, because I'm thinking maybe they're going to posthumously withdraw from her.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4355s)

Well, that could happen after watching this.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4358s)

That exact thing happened to my great-grandparents actually, and Barbara Smith, who were withdrawn from and then it all got reversed at the time of the review and then their names came back into the photo books. It was really strange.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4371s)

That's so weird.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4372s)

But I think also with Anna, the brethren don't know the half of how she went on. Like, you know, talking to your dad and we were quoting from her letters and saying all those things and he, he was even as her own son, he had no idea this was going on.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4391s)

He had no idea. He said they're going to be really shocked when they find out a bunch of this stuff that they just didn't know. Yeah, although I wonder what she did over the years with all those letters. Like especially as she started to get dementia, they must have found a stack of them, surely.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4408s)

I think she, I wouldn't be surprised if she destroyed a lot of, she was very, very careful about covering her tracks. And so all these letters and things that we have now are letters that have been fed back to us, like from my grandpa for instance. And it wasn't until we cleared out my grandpa's belongings, he died in 2019, wasn't until we cleared out his flat that we found these years and years of letters with his sister Anna.

And Anna had been [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4438s) careful. Like even right through the time that she was talking to me, she never told me that she was also talking to my grandpa.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4445s)

No, yeah, and it just came...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4447s)

as a, yeah, came as such a shock to us when we were clearing out grandpa's papers to find all these letters.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4454s)

Yeah, yeah, damn. She would have been a great spy or something, wouldn't have she been? So I guess like as we, you know, head towards potentially winding this up, there are some things I'd love listeners, especially if they're current or former brethren, to think about. One is that, you know, I mean maybe I'm just a particularly sort of planned sort of person who likes to think about things in advance, but I do encourage you to think in advance now if you've got elderly parents [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4484s) grandparents or relatives in the brethren.

You know, sooner or later that question is going to come to you of the news that they've deceased and what are you going to do about it? But I encourage you to think about in advance because it just, it's obviously an emotionally charged event anyway and I think it does help to like have tried to communicate with your insider relatives in advance about what your expectations are.

And everyone's situation is really different. Like [obviously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4514s) with Anna, we wanted to try and be there because hey, we knew she loved us and we knew we loved her. Whereas I know that for some people, their relationships with their inside family members are so strained that it might actually be way too psychologically stressful or their parent might have like been such a stickler for the rules that their parent might have not wanted them there or whatever the case may be.

But I guess in short, I encourage [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4544s) to think about that in advance about what they might like. And secondly, I would say, you know, I encourage you to do what we did, like to draw on, to lean into your rights. Like you have rights as a family member to be able to pay respects to your loved ones. And of course, there's different legalities around that, like whether the funeral is held in a public place of worship or not, whether it's in a private burial grounds or it's public burial grounds.

[But,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4574s) you know, find out your rights, lean into them. Use the faith and practice document, even if you're not in the UK. But if you're in the UK, definitely do that. There's absolutely provision made there for former members, no matter who you are. And, you know, whether you're an opposer because you've dared to speak up or not, you have rights to go and spend time and say goodbye to your loved ones. So I encourage people to, you know, the separation is not from our side, so [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4605s) find yourself abiding by it if it's not what you believe in and what you want.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4611s)

And I always attach the faith and practice document after every podcast. It's always in the comments below, so there'll be a link there always. Just click on it, read through it so that you're aware of those rights. And I just want to echo what Lindy's saying is that this is a choice you have and this is what it could look like. And honestly, this is what it should be.

I mean, obviously ultimately it would be perfect if everybody was there together and there is no religious [strain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4642s) put on this kind of a situation, but I understand we're not there yet. One day, let's hope we are. But I think the more and more people realize what this could look like through Lindy and Craig's situation will really maybe push it to them to realize that no, this is how it should be done. And they're hopefully eventually it can be something that's done together, both ins and outs. That's what it should [be,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4672s) right? A mainstream Christian church should be doing it together.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4676s)

Yeah, and a really important detail around the faith and practice document, yes, that is a document that the brethren wrote. This is not a document they were forced to write. This is a document that Bruce Hales and the legal team that he hired and put in place came up with this document and they have filed it legally in answer to the Charity Commission's questions. So this is not a document [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4706s) has been forced on them. This is a document they wrote and said, "This is what we can live with. This is what we're committing to do." So you're not asking for something that they don't already know they're committed to do. This is something that they said they would do. It's holding them accountable.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4723s)

Right, that's what every single one of these podcasts is for. It's about accountability. It's holding them accountable and when you know what is inside that faith and practice document, exercising your rights, if you choose to. Not everybody, I've laid out with my siblings on what I choose to do in the event of my parents passing away. And it's different than Lindy's due to my circumstances.

But it is important to have that laid out [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4753s) it is a very, it's a day that all of us don't want to anticipate what goes down. Those are a lot of emotions. And so that if you can think about it pre this happening, and then writing a letter is such a good way. I think it's incredible how you guys thought about this previously to it being happening and then you had, you already got through a lot of those messages that would have come back at you and how you were going to handle this, right? [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4784s) got to weave through some of those emotions.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4785s)

Yeah, and I think one of the other important things is for people who say that Anna's funeral was a one-off, one of my other aunties died last week and her funeral was on the same day as Anna's actually. And they didn't go quite as far, but the brethren did invite the non-brethren relatives to the graveside and they were much more integrated with the brethren at the graveside than has previously happened.

And they also invited, they also invited her non[\-brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4815s) daughter to come and choose what clothes she was going to be buried in as a sign of respect so that she was included in the funeral arrangements. And so this, Anna's is not a one-off case. Like the brethren are able to say compromise, of course that's a dirty word to the brethren, but the brethren are able to come to an arrangement to make sure that people are respected and included. And so it's like, you know, people don't have to do what we did, but figure out what [works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4845s) for you and make sure that they know that that's what you want.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4848s)

And was that in New Zealand too, Craig?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4851s)

It was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4852s)

Yeah, and I mean I really hope, I like, I mean you always, we look for these little slivers of hope that come our way. You're like, "Oh please, like let's hope that this is that we're changing things here." I hope that it's not just because of this Royal Commission review that's happening in New Zealand right now and it's not just a way to save some face right now. I do hope that this is something, but I mean again it comes down to those ex-brethren again, all of us reaching [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4882s) for those same requests. And again, it's like accountability, holding them accountable to what they already agreed on way back in 2012\.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4888s)

And it wasn't that Lindy and I wanted to cause trouble with us. We went out to cause a scene. We didn't want to cause any distress to you and we just wanted the bare minimum of being able to pay tribute to someone who we loved and to not be disrespected through that process.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4906s)

That's right, yeah. And on this note of funerals, let's also just have a quick chat about some other practical things because around funerals and death, because it's a topic that's not fun, but it's so important to talk about some of these things. I also encourage former members to make sure that you have a will no matter what your age, because hey, any of us could drop dead at any point. So don't just wait till you're old.

And if you're, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4936s) you are older, go and make sure that it's been revised recently and that you're happy with it. Especially if you've got next of kin who are in the brethren because there are also stories around of people who have died on the outside but because their next of kin were brethren, that you know, those brethren next of kin then were able to come in and take charge of the proceedings around the body and the funeral.

And there's, there's been [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4966s) quite, you know, disturbing stories around power dynamics there and who has, who gets to have the say over what happens to someone's funeral and their will distribution and the assets and that type of thing when that's possibly not what the deceased person would have wanted. And so it's really important, I think, if you're a former member and you do have relatives on the inside, to make it really clear in your will what your wishes are.

Yeah, who are your executors? [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=4997s) also, I think it's really important to add an enduring power of attorney as well. You know, that person who, if you do lose your mind through dementia or some other reason, that you have chosen an enduring power of attorney who you trust because again, otherwise that enduring power of attorney could go to somebody who's still in the brethren and who might have conflicting ways of going about it than what you wanted. So yeah, just a shout out around that. Think ahead, you're gonna die one day, get [prepared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5027s) for it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5027s)

And you can specify in your will that you don't want the Exclusive Brethren or PBCC to have any involvement in your funeral arrangements.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5036s)

Yep, you can. Yeah, yeah, and it's care of your children, things like that. Making sure that you've sussed out, specified, you know, who you want to have care of your children because again, it could go back to blood next of kin through, through state if the state ends up caring, yeah, making those decisions.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5056s)

When my husband just had, he had his heart transplant three years ago and we did ours up and I specifically have in mind that the Exclusive Brethren, Plymouth Christian Church, no family members are allowed to have anything to do with my, and it's very, you can be very specific. The lady that we worked with, obviously I explained to her my situation and she showed me how to specifically write it out so that there was absolutely no way around them getting [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5086s) hold of other my assets, my body, the children, anything. And so it is super important to find someone that you can even work with to help you write it out. Yeah, that's really super important to do....

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5101s)

It is very important to do. Yeah, and again, it's not to say that you might not welcome brethren family members to come to the funeral service. Like when Uncle George died, Craig, we notified the brethren members and said there's an open invite, but of course none of them came. But yeah, it's not about, it's not about keeping separate from that type of normal grieving proceedings, but it's about, yeah, those dynamics of, it's about who gets your body, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5130s)

 Like if you don't want your body going back to the brethren, that's what to be specific about.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5134s)

Yeah, all that, all that sort of thing. Yeah, and again as well, also a reminder for people to follow up and check in around how assets have been distributed once someone has died because again, usually in most countries as I understand it, if you're, if you are the biological child of somebody, you do have rights to some of the deceased assets. Is that right, Craig? And yet there are multiple accounts again, [multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5164s) accounts of, of it seems like a person's assets being distributed primarily among the brethren offspring and then some of it going to brethren entities, and then like either none or a nominal amount being given to those on the outside.

Which is, it's just really unfair and many times it's not actually what the parent would have wanted. There's stories of, you know, people who know that their parent [loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5195s) them and wanted to care for them and wanted things to be evenly distributed between their children, but who, you know, the decision making got taken out of their hands or they were pushed around as an elderly person to give their money to brethren entities or whatever. So yeah, check out those things as well, even if you're on the outside, follow up and check out those things and just make sure that what's happened is fair because you can contest it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5229s)

Yeah, Carman's very good at finding will stuff.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5232s)

Well, a lot of people don't realize that in a lot of countries wills are actually publicly accessible.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5238s)

Wow, that's so, yeah, so if you need help, email Carman. I did not know that. Yes, yes, and public, they're actually public record. Oh my gosh, I did not know that. So when I die, everyone's going to see that I'm giving all my assets to the SPCA.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5264s)

And in New Zealand you can go to the National Archives and request copies of people's wills.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5269s)

Yep. Oh my gosh, I can't believe...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5273s)

I didn't know that. That's fascinating. Yeah, it'll cost you about 20 cents a sheet to get it photocopied because they'll be still in the traditional, some of the ones that I have were filed, you know, 50 years ago and they'll still be in the ledger format. So they're held together with the long metal thingies because they don't scan them in. I think it's like, I think the cutoff was like 1995 in the ones that I have pulled, and so it'll be in the traditional [handwritten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5303s) and hand signed format. So when you get them they're actually photocopies.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5308s)

Wow, that's amazing. There you go. So listeners who want to know, you know, if they were in the parents or grandparents will have passed away, you can look that up, find it out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5320s)

There is usually a time limit to contest it though, right? Like there is a time limit to contest it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5326s)

That's right. Yeah, I think it's normally within a year or something.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5328s)

Yeah. Every different country has a different time frame and different rules around it, but yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5334s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so there you go. There's a story, a wee tale of Anna's life. And for those of you who would like to know more about Anna, here's a wee plug for Craig's book which is coming out very, very soon. How soon now, Craig? A couple of weeks?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5351s)

So about four weeks.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5354s)

About four weeks. And yeah, and he shares a lot more about George's life there and Anna also does feature extensively in the book. So maybe, maybe as well she thought she'd save herself the embarrassment and kick the bucket before that came out. If they, if they, if they're not withdrawing from her in the next few weeks, they will after that. I've read your book. Hey, Craig.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5381s)

She gets her freedom after she passes away. Well, thank you guys so much for coming on and sharing the details of this. I know a lot of people who are watching it on social media will be very pleased to be able to have the long version of what you went through. And I'll attach the links to Craig's news articles again on this podcast for those that maybe have missed it on the first one. And we're also going to add a link to Craig's book that is going to be coming out in November. And also Craig, you have something that we can [add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5418s) at the end of this in the description too. It's a letter. Can you explain to the listeners and viewers what that letter is?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5423s)

Yeah, so this is a letter that my grandpa wrote after he was withdrawn from in 1981\. He had for a few years been disagreeing with how the brethren were going under Symington and his vision actually was that he would get his thoughts together and get up at a ministry meeting on a Tuesday night and lay out to the brethren calmly and rationally why he thought Symington was wrong.

Which was a, which was always a bold pipe dream. And in the end, events sort of conspired against him and he ended up being dubbed in by his wife, my grandma, for not reading the ministry. And he was withdrawn from before he had a chance to give his address at the ministry meeting and give his word, what do they call them at Tuesday nights, addresses, his words, I forget. Words, yeah.

And so what he did was he, because he hadn't been able to deliver his word, he wrote a letter to the brethren in Wellington stating his position. He called it "A Brief Statement of a Momentous Issue" and we'll share the full letter here. But basically what he is drawing attention to is that he doesn't believe it's right for the brethren to be following one man who they're putting at the level of Paul.

And he's saying there is only one Paul. He says, "Paul has gone and we can't be elevating a flawed man to this position of God essentially that this has gone beyond what scripture would justify." And he posted a copy of this letter to all of the brethren in Wellington. And this was the letter that his sister, Lindy's nana Anna, read decades later and she wrote back to George and said she agreed with every word. And so we'll just share this here for anyone else who may be interested in the perspective of someone who was [withdrawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5555s) from in 1981\. There's just to show that these sort of concerns are not new.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5560s)

Yeah, yeah, that's really good. And I should dig out, I'm a bit embarrassed to actually, but I should dig out the letter that I wrote to Bruce Hales as well in 2008 because it had some strong overlap of exactly those same questions there where I was asking, "Where are we getting this thing of the elect vessel from? I don't get how we're elevating this person so much." And you know, I look back at that letter now that 20-year-old me wrote and I'm a bit embarrassed by some of it, but maybe I, you know, I can share it with you too, Cheryl and Carman.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5590s)

All the links will be below this description and so make sure you go on there and we'll find it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5596s)

Because it's kind of a contrast of like, yeah, 1981, did you say Craig? And then 19, uh, 2008 and it's like the same questions are being, you know...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5607s)

Yeah, and this is not a new thing and I cover this in my book. Like we're talking about Lindy's letter in 2008 and then my grandpa's letter in 1981\. I've got letters from my great-grandparents' generation in the 1960s about how deeply concerned they were about the Taylors. And then you go back even further and my great-great-grandfather being deeply concerned about Taylor Senior and yeah, this has been going on for 200 years [now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5637s)

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5637s)

It's going to carry on by the looks. Like we're gonna have children and grandchildren writing letters in 2038 and 58 unless something changes. It's so distressing. People need to maybe...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5653s)

Like maybe also just a word here to the people who were never in the brethren who have been affected by this as well. And we saw this at Anna's funeral, that her first cousins who she had grown up with before the separation days are now in their 70s and 80s and they're still deeply, deeply traumatised by what happened when their grandparents suddenly cut them off in the 1960s, when their cousins suddenly disappeared. And I talked to some of those cousins [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5683s) have never been in the Brethren but are still really, really impacted by it. So the sort of the tentacles of Brethren control go far, far beyond just the people who are in fellowship now and the people who have left.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5696s)

Yeah, so true.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtFJ4ELDg3I&t=5697s)

So that's a really good point. Yeah, I'm so looking forward to your book and it's probably the one book I've looked so, so much forward to when it's coming out. So we'll attach a link to that below as well. Any questions, you email us at info.getalife@proton.me.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
*   **Rapid Relief Team (RRT)** – The PBCC's emergency and disaster relief organization, generally recognised as a corporate sanitizing and PR initiative.
*   **Gospel Hall Trusts**  – Legal entities that own and maintain PBCC meeting halls and church properties across various regions.
*   **Bible & Gospel Trust** – The official publisher and distributor of PBCC-approved religious literature and scriptures.

This summary is provided for clarity, as these organizations are often referenced in connection with PBCC operations, outreach, and influence.
