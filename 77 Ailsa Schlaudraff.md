## Summary

TRIGGER WARNING- This podcast contains discussion on sexual abuse.
In this powerful episode, we witness a harrowing account of heart-wrenching abuse and manipulation. Ailsa walks us through the sinister web of a controlling relationship and a cult that protected her abuser and still does to this day. Ailsa bravely shares the hardships she and her daughter endured, including their walk through the justice system. She has the full court transcript proving the charges her ex was found guilty of, yet the PBCC continues to deny his ‘guilty’ court conviction and tell those inside that he hadn’t been found guilty.
From a woman's shelter to a home she has for herself now, Ailsa shares valuable insights and offers guidance to those who may be in a similar situation, and proves it is possible to escape; not just a cult environment, but also an abusive and controlling relationship. She goes through step by step of what you need to make this escape possible.  It is an incredible story of overcoming adversity to live a fulfilling life outside of a cult.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

Welcome to another episode of the Get A Life podcast with Jacky, Anne and Ross. We are joined by our special guest Ailsa Schlaudraff from Germany. Ailsa is here to tell her story, so I'll hand over to you Ailsa.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=82s)

Thank you. Hello everyone. Hi everyone. Hello. Hello.

Yeah, so my name is Ailsa Schlaudraff. I'm from Giessen in Germany. I was, I came from Birmingham in the UK before I was married. Yeah, I left three and a half years ago with my daughter. My story doesn't really start until I got married or until I met my ex-husband.

My childhood was fairly average, lonely maybe insofar as I'm the youngest of five and my four older siblings were 19, 17, 15 and 13 roughly when I was born, so they were all married and out of the house by the time I was 11\.

My second oldest sister, she married a German man, a German brother, when I was only 18 months old and she had two boys, who are my nephews, they're two and a half and four years younger than me. And they, so they kind of, they were more like my siblings than my actual siblings in many ways. And so I spent [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=181s) lot of time over here in the summer holidays and various other holidays.

My mum struggled to cope quite a lot. When I was just gone 20, in December 2003, I came over here for 10 days to visit my sister and I'd only been over here about 24 hours. I think it was the first meeting when I was approached, my ex-husband approached me after the meeting [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=216s) kind of made it fairly obvious that he was interested.

And in one sense I was probably flattered by the attention and I was more than a bit kind of horrified by the fact that he was showing me any attention because he had a reputation as long as his arm. He was infamous pretty much throughout the continent of Europe. Certainly, I think pretty much everyone would have known him, maybe not the UK, but here on the continent.

He was just a very loud, flamboyant, over-the-top, extroverted, very charming kind of person but very wild, immature. And while I was certainly no, I wasn't a good girl. I was quite rebellious in the, in the brethren sense of the word. And I had no problems with going to restaurants and cinemas and having pre-recorded music and things like that but he was way, way over the line as far as I was concerned.

I mean he would regularly go to a nightclub on Saturday evening with his worldly friends and turn up, go [straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=319s) to the supper on a 6 a.m on a Sunday morning drunk and he was a smoker, he was into his drugs. They were regularly brought across the border by the Dutch brethren to the Sunday morning reading in Dusseldorf where they were then brought on down here.

When I first went to his house, he had a bong on the windowsill which he stuck a plastic flower in and told his mum it was a vase. Yeah, he had a TV in his bedroom. He'd actually done an apprenticeship as a carpenter which of course in itself was very, very controversial, that's, you know, it's just not allowed at all really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=374s)

So in brethren terms the way he was behaving was very taboo, wasn't it? Was that ever taken issue with through his sort of younger years by the brethren?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=385s)

No, not at all. And I think 98% of other people doing the same things would have been taken issue with and been thrown out on their ear to be honest. But I think the fact that he got away with it really comes down to the sort of person, the character that his father was.

His father was very, very physically, verbally, psychologically abusive, especially to his children. I mean all these children had a terrible childhood, terrible, terrible childhood and I think in later years that it almost made me put up with a lot more than I otherwise would have done because I kind of felt sorry for him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=433s)

And was his father considered like a leading brother? You know, was he sort of quite prominent?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=441s)

No, no, no, not at all, no. That's interesting. But he was feared. He was very, the local brethren were very definitely just scared of him and because of that, I think his kids were allowed to get away with a lot more than anybody else really. They were kind of known as being a troubled family.

Right, yes. I mean he's also the youngest of five and yeah, there's just been a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble in the family.

So yeah, I wasn't altogether flattered when he started paying me attention, but I was pretty lonely and he was easy to talk to. He was, as I say, he was very charming. And I've said often since he's a very, very good salesman and the thing he sells best is himself. He's got a brilliant sense of humor and he's good fun if you don't have to live with him.

So when he actually said to me the evening, the night before I went back home, he asked if he could have the phone number and if we could carry on talking on the phone. And of course, I mean, that's just not, it's not done really unless you have marriage in mind. It's just not done for an unmarried boy and an unmarried girl to talk on the phone.

Maybe these days when they've got WhatsApp it might be a bit more common, I don't know, but back then it certainly wasn't. And I said to him, look, I said, you're easy to talk to, you're good fun. I'm pretty lonely in the evenings after the meetings, I've got nothing against it. I said, I don't know what your parents would think, I don't know what my parents would think, but I have to make it clear now, I don't want to marry you. I said, I don't think you're ready for marriage and I'm not interested.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=590s)

So how old would you both have been at about this point, Ailsa?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=594s)

Yeah, we were both 20\. He's about three months older than me, so we were both 20 at the time. Right, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, so I came home, and that actually happened for about six to eight weeks. He rang a couple of evenings a week, and we chatted on the phone. And it was about middle to end of February when he brought up the subject of marriage again. Or he brought it up. Not again.

And I said to him again, I said, look, I think you're too immature. I said, I think you're too wild. Uncommitted in a brethren sense of the term. And I'm not interested in marrying you.

And it was the following evening, I think, or a couple of evenings later that my father had a phone call from his father saying, this is not on, this is not suitable, we can't allow these two young people to keep talking to each other unless they are committed to marrying each other. Your daughter's been leading my son on and you should, you should insist that she commits to marrying him.

And my father had my back as he still has to this day, bless him. He said, look if it's her commitment, if it's her conviction she doesn't want to marry him, then we're certainly not going to make her. And he said something to the effect, I'm not exactly sure what, but something to the effect of, we wouldn't be very happy about marrying your [son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=714s) anyway, which of course went down like a lead balloon.

So the next time he rang, so in the meantime, this was like the end of February, so it had been announced around that time that Bruce Hales was coming to Europe on one of his tours. And he was going to be flying into, or the first meeting he was going to be taking were in Endbach and he was coming the beginning of April. And he was actually, when he was in Endbach, he was going to be staying with my ex's sister and her husband.

So the next time he rang, he said to me, my parents and my siblings are putting pressure on me to speak to Bruce Hales when he comes to ask Bruce Hales, whether he thinks I'm ready for marriage. What do you think about it?

And I said, it's fine by me. Do what you want. And, and I, you know, we, we've all got that mentality that if Bruce Hales said, yes, he's ready for marriage, then there's no doubt about it. You know, you can be absolutely a hundred percent sure that Bruce Hales knows what he's doing. He knows everything, you know, he can look at you and see inside your soul in five seconds is it or something like that. And I thought, well, you know, if Bruce Hales says yes, you can get married, then maybe I'm wrong. [Maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=812s) I'm wrong.

So he rang through, some local brother gave him a phone number, which I think whoever that brother was must have got a bollocking because the phone number he was given was actually Bruce Hales's private number. Wow. Which even back then, it just wasn't done, you know. Yeah.

So it wasn't, of course, 20 years ago. It's not the same as it is now when you not only have to, you have to write an application to speak to him, but you also have to hand in a written list of questions, don't you, that you want to ask. So, I mean, it wasn't like that, but he still had to ring through to get an appointment to speak to him. So he rang this number and got directly through to Bruce Hales himself.

Now, of course, what was actually said, I've only got him and his father's word for it. And unfortunately, I'm not sure exactly how accurate it was, whether I was told the whole truth. I just don't know. But what I was told was he asked him what he wanted. And he said, I want to speak to you about getting married, Mr. Hales.

And Bruce Hales said to him, if you lose 40 kilograms by the time I come, you can come and speak to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=909s)

40 kilograms weight?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=913s)

Yes. Yes. What on earth was that about? What's that about?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=917s)

Is this the advice of the man of God?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D920s)

Yeah, that's correct.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=923s)

Putting that in context, that's about five stone, something like that in weight, is it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=930s)

I'm not very good with my conversions.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=933s)

There's two pounds to a kilo roughly so...

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=935s)

Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a heck of a lot of weight. I mean, don't get me wrong, he had it to lose. He had it to lose. I was the thin one back then. But yeah, I mean the words pot, kettle and black come to mind, don't they? Yes I do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=958s)

It's called deflecting blame I think, isn't it?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=963s)

Anyway. But the thing is, the insane part about it was, this was, they rang through on the 10th or the 11th of March and Bruce Hales was coming to Endbach on the 8th, so that's actually less than a month he gave him to lose 40 kilograms.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=982s)

Um.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=983s)

Which is just insane. I mean, it's dangerous, plain and simply, it's dangerous. And I personally feel that that affected his health long term. He had serious health issues throughout our marriage and I'm positive that part of it is because of that, because he did it, he managed it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1007s)

I was going to say, that was going to be my next question. Did he actually manage it?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1012s)

So he took, well he actually lost 39, 38.9. Wow. In a month. In a month, less than a month, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1020s)

Oh God.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1021s)

I mean the man...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1026s)

What's interesting about that, this is digressing a bit, is how an order can be given that most people will laugh out loud about. I mean, we all did, didn't we, when you said it. Yeah. And yet when you're in there, so try and get across, when you're in there, because Bruce Hales has said it, it's no laughing matter. You have to do it. Yeah, yeah. And I find that quite incredible.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1051s)

That, well, it becomes, it becomes a test of fellowship, doesn't it? It becomes, yes, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1057s)

Yeah, yeah. And if he hadn't done it or hadn't tried, then they'd be saying, well, his loyalty to the man of God would be in question, wouldn't it?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1069s)

Yeah, because they would say, if he hadn't, if it wasn't possible, he wouldn't have told him to do it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1078s)

That's quite worrying really, that gives Bruce Hales immense power, but we can digress from your story.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1085s)

No, I mean, it just, I mean, he had severe glandular fever just after we got married and it took him a good two years to recover. He had his first heart attack at 25, he had a stroke at 30 and I'm positive that that was a big factor. I'm positive it was. But you know, what can you do?

So I'm not altogether sure how he did it. I know it was involved some kind of imported drugs from Holland. He did promise me once if they weren't class A, they were dietary pills of some sort, but I don't know. I don't know. Anyway.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1128s)

I was going to say actually, you know, could the heart attack and stroke have actually been caused by drug use rather than, just don't know.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1138s)

Who knows? Who knows? Yeah.

Yeah, so Bruce Hales came to Endbach and he got to speak to him in his sister's house on the Thursday. He spent about 20 minutes in the house in the in the lounge with him and again, I only have their word for it and I don't, I was never told all of what was said.

What I was told is he, Bruce Hales said you're not earning enough, you go to work tomorrow and you tell your boss you need to earn double. And he said, have you got a girl in mind? Whereupon my ex said, there's a girl I've been talking to.

And Bruce Hales said, well, I'm going to be in Leamington on Sunday morning for the reading. I want you to fly to England. I want you to come to the meeting. I want to speak to you both together. So that's what happened.

And we went to this fellowship meeting in Leamington on the Sunday. And I mean, it was just my worst nightmare. Because I'm a personally, I'm a very introverted, shy sort of person. And I suppose to set a scene, how many, Gilli and you would know Leamington room, how many people would have been packed in there? 1500?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1238s)

Yeah, probably, yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1241s)

Yeah, probably for a Bruce Hales fellowship meeting, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1244s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, it was packed. It was packed. The foyer was packed. The side corridor and the side foyer were packed. And I mean, these days, when Bruce Hales takes a meeting, the meeting finishes. And you can hear a pin drop, can't you? Right. And everyone stays sitting down until he gets up. And then in those days, everyone then got up and watched him walk out of the room.

Nowadays, or at least when I left, goodness knows what's happened since, only the brothers were allowed to stand up. The sisters, I mean, you know, you could be sat there for 20 minutes, half an hour, less than a metre from this row of black flannel covered arses, you know, all these brothers standing up in front of you. It was only the temptation. No, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1309s) really. It was demeaning to be honest. I always felt it was really, really demeaning.

Yeah. Yeah, because you know, you were only second class, you weren't good enough to stand up and watch him walk out the room. The sisters now are only allowed to get up when Jenny Hales gets up, which is after he gets out of the room.

Anyway, so back in those days, of course, it was before the days of marquees and waiting rooms and armchairs and all the rest of it they have waiting for him now, drinks cabinets and so whoever wanted to speak to him, you had to kind of, you had to be sat on the end of the row of the aisle he walked up and you were then allowed through by the rowblockers.

And we actually, we got to him just as he was just outside the main meeting room, so about a meter into the foyer. So you've not only got this whole room [full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1374s) of people standing there in absolute silence watching and straining to hear every word that's said. You know, you're in the foyer and the whole foyer's full of people as well. And it was just my worst nightmare. It really was because there's nothing I hate more than being the centre of attention. Totally humiliating, really. Well, yeah, yeah.

Anyway, we got through to him and he looks at me and he turns to my ex and he says, so this is her then. He turns to me and he said, do you think he's ready for marriage? And I kind of immediately thought, well, I thought that's why we'd come to speak to you, to be honest. And I said, Mr. Hales, I'd like to hear your opinion.

And he said, well, what my father said to Jenny when we got engaged, he said was, if Bruce loses his way to the testimony, are you strong enough to stand? Oh my word. In other words, yeah, would she be true to the church rather than to her husband?

And you see for me, because we've been taught that no word that these men say is without meaning, right? So for me it was instantly clear, it was instantly obvious to me that this guy next to me is going to go out of fellowship and I'm going to be, if I marry him, I'm going to be an assembly widow.

And an assembly widow of course is someone who, you know, where their husband has left the church. And there's not much worse, I don't think, than being an assembly widow because it's a terrible position to be in. One of my aunts was an assembly widow since I was born and I mean she's a lovely person, she's very kind but I honestly don't think I know of a more miserable person. I don't think I've ever seen her laugh, rarely smile, just [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1525s) was just the last thing on earth I wanted to be, you know.

And so it was an immediate reaction for me. Okay, that's it. As far as I'm concerned, no way am I touching this guy with a barge pole. Unfortunately, the next thing that Bruce Hales said was, so when were you thinking of getting married? Whereupon my ex said, well, we were thinking of a week on Tuesday, the 20th.

What? Yeah. Because, okay, to put that into context, on the way to the meeting in the back of the car, we'd been kind of laughing and just joking. And he'd said to me, he said, what should we say if he tells us to get married? And me, with my stupid mouth, said kind of half sarcastically, half just being stupid. Well, what about week on Tuesday? That's the 20th.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1587s)

Yeah. So that's where that came from? Your joke. Yeah. That's where that came from.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1597s)

And so Bruce Hales said, yes, I think that's good. Go ahead.

He tried to, he gave him 50 pounds and my ex, he sort of pulled his hand away, said;

“Mr. Hales, that's not necessary. You don't need to do that.”

And he hissed at him. He said;

“Don't embarrass me in front of all these brethren.”

And then he turned around and walked off.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1623s)

So hang on, had he even proposed at this point?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1626s)

No, he never proposed. 

**Jacky Hart**

Was that your proposal? 

**Ailsa Schlaudraff**

He never proposed, I never said yes.

**Anne Hamilton**

 Yeah, same happened to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1637s)

And apart from you'd obviously spoken to your ex on the telephone, but how much time had you actually spent with him? Alone? Alone?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1649s)

Other than telephone? I'd never been alone with him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1652s)

You've never been in a room with him on your own? No, no, no. I remember, Anne, you said similar, didn't you, with your ex? Yeah.

**Anne Hamilton**

Doesn't happen. 

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1660s)

No. We had been bowling when I was over there, taking us bowling, but we were with my two nephews and my cousin, one of my cousins had gone across with me so I mean literally on my on her own, no, not at all.Doesn't happen. 

No. So we got married 10 days later.

**Anne Hamilton**

 How on earth did you do that? 

**Jacky Hart**

I was gonna say, did you … just practically?

**Ailsa Schlaudraff**

,Well then to be fair, you're not allowed much of a wedding anyway, are you? So you buy a dress off the shelf and what else is there really?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1702s)

But I'm also thinking practically from a legal point of view. I mean, they'd have to get the marriage license certificates and all that things put in place rather hastily, wouldn't they?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1713s)

Yeah, yeah. I, to be honest, the details of it all are pretty, are pretty vague now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1720s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1720s)

I don't know, I don't know what happened, how that all happened. I really don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1730s)

Well I mean a Brethren person must be registered to oversee a marriage, they must have sort of effectively registrars amongst them registered I suppose. Yeah I don't know how it works, they must be able to access the paperwork pretty pronto.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1746s)

Well of course in England isn't it the actual meeting rooms that are registered not the people?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1750s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1751s)

I'm not sure. He could well be right. Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1754s)

Yeah. But then there's an individual that's licensed essentially, isn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1761s)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1766s)

Yeah. I mean, we didn't even have anywhere to live. We lived in his sister's basement for three months. We just didn't even have a house. So I would say within six months, I'd realized what I'd married kind of. The abuse I would say [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1800s) started with control, extreme control. Obviously it progressed over the years. I, sorry, I'm going to struggle talking about this a bit but, psychological abuse and extreme manipulation. He very, very quickly managed to isolate me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1828s)

Even from brethren? Yeah. So this, this isn't just a case of keeping you separate from the world, which we all know the brethren do. He was trying to isolate you from your, the community you belong to.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1841s)

Even from my own family, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It went through a long period of time when I was only allowed to call my parents maximum once a week.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1849s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1850s)

I mean I was terribly, terribly homesick. I'm a city girl, right? I've been brought up in a big city. I don't like the country, never have, still don't. And I'd come from a city of three million to a village of 500, absolutely beautiful, surrounded by forests and hills, absolutely stunning, but I bloody hated it. I really did. It wasn't happening.

Yeah, I mean, it was, there was nothing within walking distance, there was no shops. I had no car during the day. I got friendly with two or three other young married sisters but he very quickly found, either he either forbade it immediately or outright or he would find a way of causing bad feeling. Even to the extent of, I mean he wouldn't allow me to drive for the first two years I was there.

Things like my sister would want to take me shopping for my birthday, take me shopping, buy me some clothes, he just wouldn't allow it. He would not allow it. He would say things like, why should you be allowed to go out and have fun during the day when I have to work? Yeah, I mean it was...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1952s)

How much do you think the brethren ethos of you must be a subject wife, which we know is very, very strong, and I know you suffered a bit from this Anne, that feeling you couldn't do anything because what your husband says goes and you would have a huge stigma if you disobeyed him. How strong was that with you at the time?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1976s)

I mean, I was no, I'm no meek and mild person in my own four walls, but it had a huge impact on me not showing anything on the outside to other people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=1999s)

Right, yes. For fear of what the consequences would be and what people would think. Yes.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2000s)

And unfortunately, because he's such a charming, outgoing, lovable person on the outside, he hides it very, very, very well, very well. Yeah.

**Anne Hamilton**

Sometimes when it's like that, you almost think it's you then, don't you? 

**Ailsa Schlaudraff**

Oh, absolutely. 100%. I mean, by the time I left 16 years later, yeah, 100%, you think it's you. Of course you do. 

**Anne Hamilton**

Yeah I remember, I remember, why didn't you speak out? Because you blamed yourself.

**Ailsa Schlaudraff**

Yeah and of course with me it was strengthened over the years, that [fear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2057s) of, that it was myself or the feelings for want of a better word, it was strengthened over the years because every time I did turn for help, nothing helped. There wasn't help there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2074s)

Were you aware at any point, I'm just trying to think out, you know, if other people ever find themselves in your situation in the brethren, were you ever aware of external sources of help?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2088s)

No, no. And that's something I actually, I will come on to later. It just literally never crossed my mind.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2100s)

Yeah, it wasn't even in your thinking that there may be external...

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2102s)

Not even in my peripheral vision, no. Just not, just like that. I get that. Yeah, yeah.

My daughter wasn't born for, she was born five and a half years after we got married, so I was on my own for quite a bit. And to be honest, my homesickness didn't stop until she was born. I never settled down until then, really. And the circumstances with his family, there was enormous pressure because shortly after we got married, his oldest sister, her husband was thrown out. So she was left with, she was left alone with three children.

And then about a year before my daughter was born, her oldest son, who was 16 at the time, was killed in a car accident. And the trauma of that caused two of the other family members to come out with the fact that they had been abused by a third family member, sexually abused over a period of many, many years as children, which obviously, I mean, it shook the family, it shook, you know, it's trauma to even have something like that happen, let alone have it happen to you.

I mean, the fact that even then I was horrified by the fact that all that abuser had to do to clear his name was to write a letter of apology to these two other two. That's all that was done. Nothing else. And this, we're talking about serious sexual abuse over the course of seven to eight years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2229s)

I assume that didn't get reported anywhere outside the Brethren.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2235s)

No, no, no, no. He wasn't even shut up.

And then one of his brothers was a severe alcoholic, and we were very much involved with helping his spouse and the children and it was just, it was an awful lot of pressure because the thing is, the mentality in the brethren is, isn't it, that if so many things like that happen to a certain family, it all happens for a reason.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2270s)

Oh yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2271s)

Yeah, speaking to you, isn't it? Yes, exactly. So you start, you constantly start questioning yourself, is it me? Am I the reason all these things are happening? So it was all, it was all, all pressure really.

And I started spiraling into depression. My daughter was born July 2009 and I think, I think a little bit of postnatal depression got added to that. The marriage deteriorated even more, such as it was, once she was born, because he just could not handle the fact that my attention was divided.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D2324s)

So you had other demands on your time.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D2326s)

Exactly, I couldn't just drop everything and get him a glass of water or, you know, yeah, I was going to say wipe his ass but I better not say that, had I?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2346s)

Metaphorically speaking, there you go, it's all very clean.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2355s)

Yeah, and it was after she was born and she was a baby that actually the physical abuse started. And I think the first time that happened was she was only a few weeks old and she was crying, as all babies do. You know, we didn't know what was wrong with her. We couldn't get her to stop. And he reacted so badly, he ended up dragging me down the stairs by my hair.

And yeah, over the course of the next two or three years, I just spiraled down and down and down. And about two years after my daughter was born, his other sister's husband was killed in an accident at work. And that's when I came to the point I needed medication. I went to a doctor's, but it was far too little, far too late, basically. It really didn't help much.

And so when my daughter was about three, I'm not sure of the exact date on this one. Something happened. I don't know. I have no idea what it was, but he hadn't been speaking. He sent me to Coventry. He hadn't been speaking to me for three days. And I mean, it could have been something just as small as getting the wrong colour socks out of the cupboard for him, you know, I have no idea what it was.

But I basically cracked. I rang my sister sobbing my eyes out. I said, you've got to get me out of here. Please, please, please, can you get me out of here? I can't do this anymore. And she said, pack yourself [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2485s) bag, pack a bag for the baby, I'm coming to pick you up. I'm sending you to England, you're going to Dad and Mum's.

So that's what happened. It was actually pretty nerve-wracking because he was due home by 4:30 and I think we only managed to get out the house that just gone 4, 4:15. And I mean, we knew full well if he'd have come home and seen that I was trying to leave, it sends shivers down my spine today to think what would have happened to be honest.

But we got away. They drove us all the way up to the airport in Düsseldorf, which was two hours drive. We went through security, or I went, it was just me and the baby, of course, I went through security. Got to passport control and the guy took one look at my passport and pressed the alarm button under his desk.

And these officers just came running. There was a lady coming, came out the office to the side, she immediately grabbed my daughter off me and they said, right, you've got to come with us, you need to come with us. They took my daughter off to another room, I didn't see her again for over an hour. And yeah, they grilled me for an hour. They said, look, you've been reported, that child has been [reported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2582s) as being kidnapped and it's been reported that you are not mentally able to care for her.

Yeah, I mean, I was absolutely honest with them. I showed them bruises I had on my body.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2603s)

I was going to say, were you able to be honest with them about what was happening and what was their reaction?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2608s)

Yes, I was. I was absolutely honest with them. I had bruises on my body, I showed them. And they said to me afterwards, they'd also found bruises on my daughter's body. Of course, she was three, who knows what they were from, you know, but after an hour they said, look, we've verified that you're the mother of this child, and we're satisfied that you are mentally perfectly capable of looking after the child. We're happy to let you go. And so we went to England.

Yeah, it was pretty late the time we got there, got to Dad and Mum's actually that evening, but I know the phone call started early next morning. I don't remember a lot. My mental state was just so, so bad, quite honestly, by then. I think I pretty much slept the whole of the time I was there. But the phone calls from my ex started off as extremely abusive and aggressive. Phone calls from my parents-in-law, also very abusive and aggressive, telling them all sorts of stories about what a bad wife I was and all sorts. I don't know. I don't even know. My parents shielded me. My parents shielded me pretty much from most of it.

And of course, by which time the priests were involved. So they were on the phone as well, wanting to know. Because, of course I said, as soon as I got there, I said, look, I'm not going back. I'm not going back to him as far as I'm concerned. It's over. It's done. And of course, then, of course, the priests automatically then, they're involved, aren't they?

And so the phone calls started coming through from them. They wanted details. What's happened? We don't know anything. We would have thought you were a very close, happy couple. There's no idea that there was anything wrong at all. And I gave them details. I gave them, I told them what was happening.

It was only about a week after a week, the phone calls from my ex, they went from abusive and aggressive to wheedling, pleading, please will you come back, I miss you so much. And so after about a week the priests started ringing through saying, we've been working with him, there's a real change, but you need to come home so we can work with you together. You need to be together so we can finish working with him, but he's made a real change. He's very, very sorry for what he's done. You need to come home, you need to come home, you need to come home.

He then started ringing. I started getting humble, in inverted commas, humble phone calls from him. I'm very sorry and I've been a bad husband, all the rest of it.

Yeah, and it was during that time that I first was told what I was told many, many times over the years since, that the only resolution, the only acceptable resolution is reunification.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2827s)

And again to put this into context for people that don't know the Brethren about what the brethren believe, they believe marriage is for life regardless. They fly a flag, I think in their own brochure, they claim that divorce is extremely rare amongst the brethren and they point to the world where divorce rates are high as how wicked it is, whereas in the brethren, our marriages are so happy this doesn't happen. So from the [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2858s) perspective, they will go to any ends of the earth to keep a couple together. Would that be a fair comment? Regardless of what you've been through or what you've had to suffer, the ultimate goal effectively is protecting the testimony by keeping the couple together.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D2874s)

Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2876s)

Yeah, and these, and these priests that are begging you to come back, and again, this is for people who aren't aware of the brethren, this bear in mind these are people with absolutely no psychological training, absolutely no training in therapy or anything. These are just pure, these are just people who have just got...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2894s)

They haven't even, like...

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2896s)

Like Jackie says, the interests of the brethren's appearance.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2902s)

Yeah, they haven't even got theological training. No, no, no.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2907s)

Certainly no marriage guidance training or counseling training or how to spot abuse training.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2918s)

Would it be also be fair to say that they always take the side of the abuser?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2929s)

I would say to a certain extent they did take my side, but only so far, you know. They will only, they will only take my side as long as I do exactly what they want to do. Yeah, right. And of course your parents can do nothing because they're then interfering in the marriage. Yeah, absolutely.

And as I say, my parents had my back absolutely 100% and they still have to this day [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2959s) it comes to my marriage. I can't fault them in that. And it was after 10 days. I've been there for 10 days when I gave in. I said, OK, I'll go back. I believe them. I believe he's changed. I'm going to go back.

And my parents weren't happy about it. They said, we don't think he's changed, are you sure you want to do this? But at the end of the day, you know, they couldn't force me to stay. So I booked a flight and I came home. We flew into [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=2989s) Frankfurt airport.

And I walked out of the departure gate. I had India Rose in the pushchair. I had my bag with my passport and my keys, my wallet on my shoulder. And I had a suitcase in the other hand. And I walked out the departure gate. He walked straight up to me. He grabbed the bag off my shoulder with all my passport, my purse, my keys, everything in it. He took India Rose out the pushchair and he came inches close from my face and he spat at me. He said;

“ I will never forgive you for what you've done to me.”

 And he turned around and walked off.

I [swear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3039s) to this day, I was standing there in the airport, I could feel the bars just dropping, clang, clang, clang, and I was trapped. I was trapped again. And I remember sitting there, standing there watching him walking away thinking, if I can run after him, I might be able to grab her and go down that corridor there. And I was thinking, yeah, but hang on, no, I can't do that. I haven't got my passport, I've got no keys, I've got no money.

And this is, it always comes back to what you're saying, Jackie, that I'm in an airport for God's sake. I could have just shouted the word help. Yeah, but it never occurred to me. Yeah, I'm surrounded by police officers, you know, the help was there but I didn't know how to take it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3090s)

Yeah, yeah. Because you're not, you're not, firstly, I think in the Brethren you're taught outside help is unwanted, so there's that huge stigma, isn't there, of reaching out for it anyway. And secondly, I think there's a huge unawareness of outside help. Yeah, you know, that what support networks are there, quite apart from the authorities, support networks and charities that offer refuge and help to people that find themselves in the situation you found yourself in.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3117s)

But also, also the, we're brought up with that being hammered into us that the brethren's help is far above...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3127s)

Yeah.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3128s)

Any external, any external kind of help. Your natural reaction is to go, is to go to the brethren because that's where...

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3136s)

And any, that's where we need to go. And any external help you do get basically is what they call bringing disrepute on the testimony.

Unfortunately, that incident was pretty much all I remember for about 12 months. At that point, I disassociated, complete disassociation. My mind wasn't in my body anymore. It was just, I have one memory a short time later. My mother-in-law was at my house for some reason. I was on the floor, I don't know why, maybe I was cleaning, I don't know why, but she was standing over me with a Bible reading scriptures at me, preaching to me about [being](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3194s) a good wife.

You have to be a better wife, you have to be a better wife. You should have a meal of his choice on the table every evening when he comes home. You should have his slippers waiting for him when he comes home. You should be waiting at the door to take his coat. You should be a better wife, you need to be a better wife. That is the only memory I have.

I'm not sure of the time frame because of all, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3224s) of the, yeah, the fact that I just wasn't mentally with it. But the next thing I remember was walking out of the door with his brother and his sister-in-law. She'd come round to visit me apparently, so I was told later, and had found me slumped in a corner, half-dressed, and when she tried to talk to me, all she could get out of me was, there's nothing left to live for. I don't want to be here anymore. There's nothing left to live for.

Whereupon she'd immediately packed a case and they took me into the psychiatric hospital, which I'm very thankful for, very thankful to them for, because I wouldn't be here today if they hadn't done that, no doubt about it. Yeah, they had me on suicide watch for a while but once I was there, I very, very quickly started to pick up, very quickly. And within a week, I was kind of not back to myself, but I was, I was with it again.

And once I sort of come to myself, I again said, I'm not going back. That's it, it's over, I'm done, not going back.

Actually, just to go back to the fact that at the airport, I actually didn't see my passport again for nearly four years because he hid my, he hid both our passports, mine and my daughter's. He hid it and I actually didn't get to see them again for another four years.

He told me he'd done that on the advice of someone. I don't know whether that's true and whose advice it was, I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3357s)

I can believe that because it's not the first time I've heard of passports being hidden when they think somebody might, in their eyes, do a runner. I mean, you were only going back home to your parents, you weren't doing a runner as such, were you? You were going to a place that you perceived had been refuge and sanctuary. Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3376s)

Yeah. Yeah, so that hospital visit, I was in for six weeks, and it kind of changed everything in some ways because it was my first contact with worldly people. I mean, you know, homeschooled, worked for my dad, I just never came into contact with worldly people until then.

And I, as we all are, I was shocked by how kind and understanding and sympathetic and loving they were. And in many ways, I was shown much more sympathy and understanding than I ever had been in the brethren. One of the first things the doctor said to me was, if you go back to your husband, it's not a case of if you come back to hospital, it would be a case of when you come back to hospital.

So I had that and I said this to the priests, I said, look, the doctor said this, I'm not going back, it's as simple as that. But of course, you know, all hell broke loose then, doesn't it? Because there's no way they're going to accept that. And alone the fact that I was in that hospital, I mean, they do not like you being in a psychiatric hospital. They really do not like it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3472s)

Yeah, I mean, it's also the fact that when you're in a place like that, although it's for your own well-being, they've lost control. Yeah. So when you're there, you're talking to the doctors, you're talking to other people that may have problems, you're realizing you're not alone in the world. You've got people who are minded to actually help you and to try and get to the root cause of why you're so mentally upset. And that's what they don't like because then they lose their, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3502s) system, the brethren system loses its control over you, doesn't it? Yeah. As you say, it was the best thing that ever happened to you in a funny way. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3513s)

Yeah. I mean, they started visiting, the priests started visiting at hospital, you know, I had brothers turning up at hospital and they, they wanted three things. They wanted to know in detail again what had been happening, they wanted to try and insist I go back to him, and they wanted to get me out of that hospital as soon as they possibly could.

But unfortunately, this time I [refused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3543s) to cooperate. I said, I told you the details, I gave you the details and fuck all happened, right? I'm not going to tell you anymore, I'm not interested. I said, I'm not going back to him and as far as leaving the hospital goes, I said, I'm not leaving this place a day before I'm discharged.

And of course, unfortunately, as soon as I refused to cooperate, I then became the difficult one, an insubject woman. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

It was about, I think it was about three weeks into the six when the other woman who was on the ward, we slept in the same room, she's about the same age to me and I got on really well with her. She was really nice. She said to me, you know what you need? You need a makeover. She said, I'm going to take you into town, you're going to get your hair cut, we're going to get it dyed and you're going to go and buy yourself a load of new clothes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3612s)

Love it.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3615s)

Yeah, I mean, I loved it too, but of course you can imagine how it went down when I got short dyed hair, right? Yeah, plus the fact, of course, part of the therapy was physical therapy and one of the priests turned up to give me a priestly visit and saw me coming back from this physical therapy in trousers, jogging trousers, and of course that was an absolute no-no as well.

Yeah, but I stuck to my guns. At this point, were you considering leaving the brethren? No, no, no, no, I wasn't. I wasn't. And because, A, I had nowhere to go and B, to be honest, right up until the point I left, I still believed in the whole system.

So I stuck to my guns and it was about in the last week they eventually caved and agreed to give me a house. An old brother had moved in to live with his son to be cared for and the house hadn't been sold, so they said, here, you can move in when you come out, you can move in here with India Rose. So that's what happened. I moved in there, my parents came over and they moved in there with me and they spent three weeks with me there.

But the pressure never stops. The pressure never stops. And either it's someone turning up on the door, you know, they'll find someone who you can relate to, who you're fairly close to and they'll send that person right. And you think they're coming around for an innocent cup of coffee and all of a sudden you realize, hang on, this person's been given an agenda.

Yeah. And then you go to the meeting and the meeting's full of insubject, talk about insubject sisters and breakdowns and marriages and you know you're targeted in the meetings as well.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3743s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3748s)

And I mean, I could see pretty much that my ex hasn't changed because as an abused person, you are hyper, hyper sensitive. You learn to read their every movement, right? I think it's kind of a type of self-preservation. You learn to read. I could tell by the crook of his eyebrow how he was likely to react to something. And so, I mean, I could go to a meeting, I could look at him across the meeting and I could see, well, he hadn't changed. You know, nothing had changed there.

So my parents went home after three weeks. And as long as they were there, he kept away because he didn't like my parents. And he had a certain amount of respect. He knew I wasn't going to be on my own. But of course, unfortunately, as soon as they'd gone, he was on the doorstep every five seconds.

And you know, at the end of the day, he had so much control over me, it's as simple as that. He had a lot of control and unfortunately it was only 10 days later when I let him back in. I allowed him to move in. I still refused to go back to the house, but he moved into the rented house with me. He was on his best behavior for about three weeks that time, it was about three weeks before things went back to normal.

But it was normal, it was the same old, same old, and yet it was slightly different because I'd been given the tools to cope in the hospital, right? They teach you how to cope. And it had given me a tiny, the start of a tiny bit of self-confidence.

And so my mental state, it never went back to what it was. Thankfully, it never went, I never went back into that deep, deep black hole. I struggled right up until I left. When I left three years ago, I was on three different sorts of antipsychotics. And now three and a half years later, I'm off everything. I've been off everything for over 12 months now. 

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3905s)

Well done.

So can I just ask, sorry, can I just ask at this point, what was known as far as the brethren are concerned? Because obviously we all know when these situations happen, and there's stuff that goes around. And obviously your parents being there would have attracted attention, if you like. What was known amongst the brethren as far as they were concerned?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3930s)

Well, to a certain extent, of course, I don't know, because you don't generally get the gossip about yourself, do you? But I do know the first time I went, when I went to England, people were told I'd had a nervous breakdown. And then of course, the fact that a fairly short time later ended up in hospital, I guess they were told the same again. I don't really know. I don't really know.

Yeah, they often, they often use that, don't they? Yeah, yeah. Even when I left, they still were thinking that and they were turning up at the doors then, oh, you know, can I take your washing and ironing for you? You'd know. Yeah, it is used a lot. Yeah. So yeah, to a certain extent, I have the tools to cope better anyway.

[We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=3990s) were in that house for about nine months and it was about six months on when the orders came from Australia we should move to Siegen. He was working for a firm for a brother in Siegen. We needed to sell the house and buy a bigger one anyway, so we moved over there and that also made a huge difference for me because for a start, I was going back into a city, I was out of the country.

And secondly, the locality of Endbach is just a horrible place to live, horrible, horrible locality to be in and I hated it there. I really hated it. It's just, it's not a nice place. Whereas Siegen, Siegen had its problems, sure, but it was a family more or less and everybody cared for each other more or less, which also helped me. It made a huge difference in helping me to cope.

And we moved to this big, light, airy, beautiful house, beautiful view out across the valley. And these were all things that helped me to cope. Conditions at home didn't improve, didn't improve in the slightest. In fact, to a certain extent, they were worse because he now felt he had to keep that much more of a level of control to stop me leaving again, right? But yeah, I got through.

We moved in 2015 and it would have been about two and a half years, three years later, India Rose then started OneSchool Global. And I was dreading it because of course, they've gone from quarter past seven in the morning and depending on traffic, they sometimes wouldn't get home till 5:30 in the evening. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4130s) you know, that meant I was on my own all day, every day, all over again.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4136s)

So were those long days simply because the children had to travel so far to get to the school? I mean, the school day wasn't that long, but it was literally they could have one, two hours driving to get there, is that right?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4149s)

No, from us at Endbach, brethren, they have an hour, an hour and thirty, I think. Right. And Siegen, it was, I think it was just under an hour depending on traffic.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4160s)

Okay. Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4161s)

Yeah. But of course, the thing is, it's not just, it's not just the traveling home. Once you get back, get the bus back to the meeting room, each child then has to be individually dropped off at the house, you see.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4175s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4176s)

Yeah, yeah. And that at the age of eight, in my opinion, is child abuse, but anyway.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4187s)

Yeah, yeah, that's a rabbit hole we don't need to go down. Not tonight, another night.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4197s)

So it was about, it was about that time actually that an opportunity came up and the company he was working for, they had a big, several big orders come through and he asked me, he said, look, the lady who's doing these orders is overwhelmed, she's got more than she can cope with. Do you feel like coming and helping out for a while?

And I jumped at the chance. Absolutely loved the work, loved being able to get out of the house. And shortly afterwards, that woman actually retired. And I kind of tongue-in-cheek asked if I could take her job. Very controversial, of course.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4244s)

So again, to explain to listeners who might not know, am I right in saying the expectation once you're married as a woman is you don't work? By and large, that's still the expectation, isn't it? Your job is raising the children and being in the home and at that stage it was unusual. I know Ann, you did a few things, didn't you, but it was actually unusual for a married brethren woman to have employment.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4266s)

I think, I think that there was a bit of a license given to those of us who had mental health issues. Yeah, okay. And that would have been why I was also, they could see, they knew my family knew how unhappy I was and it was everything to sort of help. I imagine that's the same for you Ailsa, it was, yeah, they didn't dare not let you.

**Ailsa Schlaudraff**

Well, there [were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4296s) three owners of the business, a father and two sons, and the father, he actually really stuck up for me, he wanted to give me the job. But I mean, the two sons were absolutely against it and they could not understand. And they kept saying, you know, you should be donating your time, you should be donating your time to Campus\&Co and to RRT and all the rest of it. You know, you shouldn't be out, you shouldn't be in the workplace, you shouldn't be with worldly people, you shouldn't be earning money.

My ex was actually all for it because unfortunately money is kind of his god. And it meant I was earning money, we didn't need it. And the day I left, not a cent of what I earned had been spent, it was all just sat there on an account, we didn't need it, but as far as he was concerned, I was earning money and that was good. Also, of course, it meant I was in the same building as him all day, so of course, there's that extra level of control, I guess, from his point of view.

So again, I was with worldly people all day because I was in a department where there was only, there was one other brother, the rest were all worldly people. It was crazy, I mean, it was crazy busy as far as I was concerned because, you know, you get up in the morning, you get the kid to school, you do the school trip, of course, you get to work, you come home, you've got an hour to get ready, do homework, shower, out to meeting. You come home at nine in the evening and then you've got maybe an hour or so to do your housework. You know, it was crazy busy, but it was the best thing that could have happened to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4414s)

And were you working full-time?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4415s)

Was it every day? Yeah, it was every day more or less, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, they were really easy about it. They said, work when you can and when you can't, stay at home, you know. And if we were entertaining at the weekend, I'd sometimes had to have a Friday or finish early on a Friday or something like that. But generally, yes, it was, it was full time, yeah.

And I kind of, working with worldly people every day, it kind of struck me really that these people are actually no different to me. Yeah, because you know, we're brought up to believe we're better, aren't they, that we're different. And no, they were actually exactly the same as me. They had the same feelings, the same stress, the same problems, you know, no difference. There's just no difference. Right.

And the other thing that made a big difference there was the woman who I worked with very closely. She was probably in her mid-50s and she started just after me and we started getting very close. We started talking a lot and she would tell me this was her first job for quite a while and she hadn't been able to work for a while because she'd been in a coma for several months.

And the more that she talked, the more that came out gradually over the months and it [turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4520s) out that she'd been in an abusive marriage and she was actually at that time, she was in the process of divorce, but her husband had pushed her down the garden stairs and that had caused her to go into a coma for several months. I'm not sure exactly how long.

And over the months, the more we talked, the more it kind of just came home to me really. She would tell me, oh yeah, he used to do this to me and he used to do that and this happened. And I would think, well, that's not so bad, that happened to me last week, or, yeah, well, that's happened several times, you know. And it eventually just kind of clicked, well, how long is it going to be before I actually end up in a coma or worse, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4581s) worse?

And the other thing that job did was gave me a huge self-confidence boost because I've been told all my married life I was useless, I was just a waste of space. I would never be able to hold, I was unemployable, that was one of his favorites, I was unemployable. I'd never be able to hold down a job. And then there I was all of a sudden actually working, holding down a job and being very good at it. And that gave me the self-confidence to realize, hang on, if I leave, I actually, I actually have the power, it's within my power to stand on my own two feet and look after myself, which I'd never felt before.

And it was, it was all around this time that certain things started coming to light that were happening to my daughter. I'm not going to go into it on here, it's not my story to tell. My mother had warned me several years before, she said, you need to watch that, that's not normal, something's wrong there, that shouldn't be happening. And I think also other various other family members started noticing things and commenting and I think I didn't want to see it because the reality was just too awful to accept.

But it came to a head December, just about a week before Christmas in 2019, when he lost it for some reason. It was nothing particularly unusual. He tried to get through to me on the phone. He was upstairs in bed, wanted something, tried to get through to me on the phone because I was down in the basement ironing. My phone, the battery had died. The battery had died so I couldn't answer him. He lost it, snapped my phone in half.

And a while later, while he was completely losing his shit, my daughter came to me and she basically collapsed in my arms. She was 10 at the time. Her poor little body was shaking from head to foot and she just kept saying, Mama, I'm so scared of Papa, I'm so scared of Papa. And that really clicked, something in my head clicked and I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4761s), that's it, this is it. I've got to get out of here. And I knew from past experience that there was no getting out of here while staying in the brethren. If there had been, I would definitely still be there today because at that time I believed in, I believed it.

So the next day, I contacted a family member who had, I had actually had several family members who have left over the past seven or eight years. And I contacted, I actually contacted two of them. And together we started coming up with a plan to get us out. They immediately contacted a lawyer and she gave me invaluable tips, invaluable help really. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be where I am now without the help of that lawyer.

And it's actually, I don't know whether we're going on too long, but it's something I'd quite like to go into in a bit of detail because I know there are other people in my situation. And there's so many things you can do. You see, my biggest fear in leaving was the fact that I was positive I was going to lose my daughter, because I've seen it so many times through my life, a parent leaves or even both parents leave, and yet the brethren still managed to keep the children.

I mean, we had it, we had that situation in France where both the parents left and yet the grandparents literally kidnapped the four children and managed to gain custody of them. And so there are things you can do.

And the main tip she gave me was, sorry I'm trying to think of the English word right now, proof, right, yeah proof, proof, proof, proof she said. Yeah so document everything, keep a journal, write a journal every day of things that happen and everything, even if you think something's not important, because when you're in that situation, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4937s) so much that is normalized, which actually isn't normal.

So write a journal, write everything down. Take videos, recordings, but obviously you've got to be careful, right, because if an abuser sees that he's been recorded or he or she, you know, you've got to be careful obviously, got to be careful. Photograph anything, any bruising, any damaged furniture, anything. Keep [records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=4981s) of everything you possibly can. And really important, don't keep it where it can be found.

Find a safe person. Find someone, if you can, someone outside. If not, try and find a safe person inside who you think will be true to you rather than the church, which I agree is not easy. But if you can't find someone, go to authorities. There are people who can help you, can be that safe person for you, right? And make sure [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5022s) documentation, any records, any videos, anything you've got is duplicated and sent to a third person so that if anything gets found, you've still got it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5044s)

Yeah, I think that's absolutely invaluable advice and I'm glad you've said it because you know, by telling your story, that if there's one person in the brethren who finds themselves in your situation or indeed in the situation you found yourself in and they listen to your story and it gives them strength just to do that, then it's worth the difficulty of speaking out, isn't it?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5068s)

Yeah, I mean, I can't, these women in there, yeah, women in there don't know what to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5077s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5078s)

And it's always the same story as you and me, that yeah, we lose our children.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5083s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5084s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5087s)

And we know from other people that I've tried to help over the years, we know that the brethren will use any tactic under the sun to get the children off parents. And to put that from the brethren's perspective, the people will say, what on earth are they doing? The brethren's perspective is that a child is better off in the assembly than out in the world, even if that means saying goodbye to their mother or their parents. And they believe that [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5117s) strongly that it's actually probably okay to lie, to make up stories, to do anything to save that child.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5126s)

It's better to keep them in the assembly, even if it means them being in an abusive situation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5132s)

Yeah. And it's incredible that that can be allowed to happen, but we're trying to stop it.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5145s)

So the other things that I started planning and putting into practice was ways of getting money out. Because in my personal situation, I was tracked. I had trackers on my phone. The car was tracked. And any card transaction, any cash that was withdrawn got sent immediately by SMS to his phone. So I had no way of saving cash. There was cash there I could have taken it, right, but I couldn't because it would have immediately raised alarm bells.

But there are ways of doing it. So every time I went shopping, [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5196s) a weekly shopping, wherever it was, whether it was a food shop, whether it was a chemist, whether it was a shoe shop, whatever it was, I would buy what I was going to buy and I would buy vouchers. So that he only got, at the end of the day, he only gets the end sum by SMS on his phone. So he was none the wiser if I spent 100 euros at Aldi. He was none the wiser that 75 euros of that was a gift voucher.

And I actually managed to amass quite a bit of money that way over the next three months. I saved any bit of cash that I could. And the other thing I did was, it might sound silly, but I went out and I bought makeup. I bought jewelry, I bought trousers, I bought all these things which in one sense I didn't need them, but as soon as I left, I didn't have the means to buy them and I was so glad that I had them. Right, because while I was there, yes, we had the means and he didn't notice the money had gone and yet it's those little things that give you a little bit of joy once you leave when you're going through hard times, right?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5278s)

So I bought all this stuff, kept it hidden. And then I had to think about things like, if we have to leave, what am I going to pack everything in? We only had one set of suitcases, and I don't want to be walking out the house with black sackfuls of stuff. So I went to eBay and I bought a load of suitcases, kept those hidden.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5305s)

What's of interest, I'm thinking of the money side of things, at this point did you still have your job in the Brethren company? Yes. So what happened to your wages? Okay, I think I know the answer.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5319s)

My full wages were sat on the bank account the day I left. I could do nothing about it, I couldn't take them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5325s)

They weren't paid direct to you into your own bank account?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5329s)

Oh, they were put in a joint account. I wasn't even allowed to spend it. No, I wasn't allowed to touch it. No, no, no, no.

Yeah, the other thing I would say is if you get that far and you're in that situation, that volatile, dangerous situation, have as much packed ready to go as possible without raising suspicions so that if something happens, if the point comes when you say, I have to get out right now, your job is just that much easier, right? And have lists of everything you've got to take. Make [lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5377s) of the essentials that you have to go so that at a moment's notice, you can just pack and get out of there.

Documents. Really, really important. That's something else that the lawyer really laid on me was to get out as many documents as I could. So passports, birth certificates, copies of the mortgage statements, house deeds, if you can get copies of those. Anything you can get your hands on, take it. And I regret not taking more. Bank statements, really important. Take bank statements of any bank accounts you've got, whether they are private loans, whether they are savings accounts, whatever they are. Get copies, take it with you and keep it all, as I say, somewhere where you can grab it and at a moment's notice just get out of there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5441s)

So the advice the lawyer gave you at this point, you'd contacted family that were no longer in the brethren, so you had a bit of support there. And then the lawyer that helped you so well, this presumably was while you were still officially in brethren and still in your marriage. So you kind of had that support to help you prepare for what was going to be inevitable.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5469s)

Yes, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5474s)

That must have taken incredible strength, I think. You're kind of leading a double life, aren't you?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5482s)

Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah. I mean, one of my family members who was outside, they gave me an old phone. So I had that, I had a second phone. So that, you know, in actual fact, because back in December he'd snapped my phone in half, yeah, he'd just given me some old cheap phone. So I hadn't, the phone itself wasn't a UBT phone as we found out later. I had a UBT card in there, so I said, yeah, but the phone itself wasn't trackable. But yeah, I had this other phone with which I contacted whoever I needed to contact. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5538s)

And then what was crunch point?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5541s)

Yeah, crunch point. The point I came to in December when I decided I was going to leave, we started putting plans into action and we decided I was going to leave the first week of the summer holidays. We thought we'd let her finish the school year, leave the first week and then she got the six weeks to hopefully get on her feet before the next school year started in the new school. But best laid plans of mice and men.

By the middle of February, I couldn't take it anymore. I think once you've made that decision to leave, everything becomes so much more unbearable somehow. And it was one morning, the 13th of Feb, he'd hit her so hard before she'd even come down for breakfast in the morning that you could see the full imprint of his five fingers on her back. At which point I said, that's it, I'm out of here today, come hell or high water.

So I packed everything in the car when he'd gone to work. I drove the school bus in the afternoon, went to school, picked the kids up and we drove from the meeting room and we dropped the bus back. The family member was then at the lawyer. The family member had gone to the lawyer in the meantime and we drove directly to the police station. We drove down here towards this area and about halfway the lawyer said, right, you need to stop, get off the motorway here, go to that police station.

I threw my SIM card out the window on the motorway somewhere. Yeah, and we were met at the police station. Actually really interesting. One of the employees of my two nephews here, they'd sent her to meet us at the police station because she'd actually been through an incredibly similar situation. She was a Mormon, had been in an abusive marriage and had actually escaped very, very similar circumstances. She had, her daughter was much younger at the time. She was only a little baby.

So she met us at the police station and she marched us in and we pressed charges for child abuse. The lawyer wanted me to press charges for myself. The police wanted me to press charges for myself. And the charges were there to be made from imprisonment to marital rape to whatever. I wasn't interested. I wanted to press charges for her, for my daughter. That was the only thing I was interested in, to be honest.

Yeah, the police took our statements and sent us from there to a woman's shelter. I mean my lawyer, she was absolutely brilliant. She's a specialist in women's abuse and children's rights. And I mean, the whole time we were at the police station, she was on the phone, she was ringing the police, she was saying you need to press such and such a charge, you need to say such and such a thing, you need to tell them this. I couldn't have done it without her. She was amazing. She really was.

Yeah, so I mean, I think Anne, you were in a woman's shelter as well, weren't you? No, I didn't, I didn't actually live in a woman's shelter. I did go there, but no, my choice was, yeah, I wish I'd known what you'd known to be honest and what you did. My choice was to stay in the house and tell them, I just had to tell them that it was finished, it was over. And like for a while, I suppose they were on my side and then they realised they weren't, I wasn't going back. The fact that then they moved my ex out of the house was the best thing that could have happened. Okay.

Yeah, I mean, we weren't there for long. It's a huge, huge culture shock. So I would say that if anyone is thinking of going down that route, be prepared for a huge culture shock because we're very, very protected in the brethren, aren't we? Very, very protected, yeah, in certain, to a certain, yeah, in certain ways.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5868s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5869s)

And all of a sudden we were in this big house with probably eight or ten other women, screaming kids everywhere and a tiny little dingy room. And all these, I just remember thinking all these women, they had this dead-eyed look in their faces. And little did I know I probably had exactly the same look in my own eyes at that time, you know. Yeah, it's a huge culture shock.

We weren't there long and over the last three and a half years we've moved four times. We've now, I've got my own apartment now. We've been here for over a year, about a [year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=5913s) and three months, something like that. My ex's lawyer actually let it slip, he nearly bit his tongue off as soon as he said it, but he let it slip to my lawyer only fairly recently that the brethren told him that they'd found us within two weeks every time I'd moved.

It doesn't altogether surprise me. I mean, I've seen them, certainly this apartment and the one before, we've seen them sat down the road in the cars. My daughter has come out of school and seen them sat in front of the school in cars watching her. But I struggle to believe they found us the first couple of months because I don't think they'd have left us alone. I mean, the thing is they had no way of contacting me and I was very definite I wanted it that way. They didn't have my new number, they didn't have my new email address, and I didn't want contact with them for quite a while.

I'm not sure exactly how long. I started by emailing my parents, I believe, and they actually kept it quiet for a while. My parents had been told by my family, my family members had contacted my parents and said, look, she's with us, she's safe, everything's okay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6012s)

Um.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6013s)

But as far as my ex and the brethren here were concerned, we more or less dropped off the face of the earth. The police told me to keep her out of school. They said, do not register yourself at any address and do not register her at any school until by law, you have rights to her.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6043s)

Did the brethren try and take your daughter back off you?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6047s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6049s)

They did.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6051s)

So it was about three, four weeks later that my lawyer then started the proceedings for custody. Yeah. Which of course he obviously contested. He contested it, he wanted full custody for himself. He handed in a list of demands as long as his arm. And the first court case was in June. Yeah, June. And to be fair, I mean, he didn't stand a chance because this is why the lawyer told me to do what...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6100s)

You had the evidence. You had been logging the evidence as you went along.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6103s)

Right, and the fact that I went straight, the first thing I did was went to the police, you see, so immediately there was an outstanding criminal investigation for child abuse against him. And there's no judge in their right mind who's going to grant somebody full custody when there is a criminal investigation for child abuse against them. It's just not going to happen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6130s)

You marvel at their arrogance to think that it might happen, to be honest. I mean it's just, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6144s)

Yeah, it was during that time that I was told, I received a letter from the priests in Siegen saying you do realize that she doesn't belong to you, she belongs to the church and we will fight for her for as long as it takes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6164s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6167s)

Now the first court case, the judge, he read through this list from my ex, he read and he's like, nope, not doing that, nope, not doing that, nope, that's not going to happen. And then he came to one request, which was my ex requested that I not be allowed to move out of country with her, which was ironic because all this time from February through to June, the brethren, all the contact I had with them, they wanted me to go and live with my parents in England.

You never need to see him again, you never need to live with him again, you can stay separated the rest of your life, go move to England, take her to England, you can go and be with your parents. And yet he at the same time was going to court asking that I not be allowed to move out of the country with her. Whether he was acting off his own bat or, I don't, I have no idea. I have no idea.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6229s)

I know that the brethren have no issue taking children out the country when the boot's on the other foot. I would protect somebody's identity by not citing the case, but I know that they would, had the boot been on the other foot, had your daughter been with your husband, they would have happily taken your husband to another country with the daughter. So they obviously assumed you would do the same and [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6259s) and therefore, so yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6267s)

Yeah, so the judge who was reading down this list and he got to this question and he looked at me and he said, are you planning to move out of the country with her? And I said, no, no interest in moving away, why would I? And he sort of, he smirked and he looked at my ex, he said, I'll give you that one then.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6284s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6285s)

And that was it. He ordered a psych evaluation to be done of the whole situation. And that took about six to eight weeks, I think. And the evaluation came back. It was recommended that he be allowed to do a video call with her twice a month. And so the judge agreed to that and he gave me full power of attorney. So custody is shared, but I have 100% power of attorney over her. All he's allowed is, well at that point it was this video call with her, and I have to write a short report on it every two weeks. I still have to do that today.

So yeah, these video calls started. He did the first one and my daughter was awake. She literally did not close her eyes the entire night afterwards. It upset her so much.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6360s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6362s)

And it came to the second one and I thought, shall I, shan't I? And I thought, oh come on, I tried to push her. She didn't want to and I pushed her. I said, you know, this is what the court said, you should do it. So she did a second one and again it upset her so much.

And it was when we came to the third one that we suddenly realized, I think it was actually, I think it was India Rose herself who realized that he'd been video, he'd been recording these video conversations, these Zoom meetings. Whereupon she had an absolute fit and said, I am not doing another one, he's recording them, I don't like talking to him anyway, I'm not doing another one.

I rang my lawyer, my lawyer said he is no way, he should be, he is [allowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6409s) to record them, don't do another one. And of course, as soon as I stopped that, he went straight back to court. Of course. Yeah, so by which time we had got a permanent apartment, we'd registered an apartment. So all the court cases and everything, it all came down here. So it was a different judge, different child protective services.

And actually it was all for the best because the child protective services here were brilliant. They had my back. I couldn't have asked for any, for more support really. She actually said to me, the lady actually said to me at one point, she said, if you take that child back to that church, she said, I will do everything within my power to make sure [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6471s) is taken off you. She said, because in my view, bringing a child up in those circumstances of that church is child endangerment.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6482s)

Wow.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6483s)

Yeah, I mean, I actually agree with that, but it's very interesting that somebody outside recognises that. I think it's indoctrination of children, I think there's abuse of children, and I don't just mean physical abuse, I mean psychological abuse of children, but it's, I think quite rare for somebody outside to say it that emphatically. That's really interesting, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6518s)

Yeah, I mean, sorry, the grounds, the first time the grounds the brethren tried to give for asking for custody was of course my mental health. And that's what they tried to play on. They brought everything up of my hospital visit and all my mental health history.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6542s)

Yeah, you're not capable of looking after your daughter because of your mental health history.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6546s)

I'm insane basically is what they were trying to say. They were trying to prove I was insane. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6551s)

It's despicable.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6553s)

Yes. Well, I mean, the psych evaluation should soon put a, soon put paid to that one.

In fact, it was quite, it was quite interesting. One of the things the doctor put in there was that his grasp of reality was, how did he put it? He has a very warped grasp on reality, I think that's what he said.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6585s)

I remember somebody else we supported through a similar situation and her barrister said to me in an email, I can't remember the exact wording, that he thinks the brethren, something about the brethren community, is one of the most dangerous communities he has ever had to come up against because of the way they operated. That's shocking, isn't it? It's shocking, isn't it, that a barrister defending somebody in a similar situation to yourself actually put that in writing to me in an email. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6626s)

Yeah, well, after these video calls stopped, of course we all got dragged back into court. And it was, as I say, it was down here, it was a different judge. And the judge ordered a second psych evaluation to be done, which was done. That took a lot longer, I think it took sort of three or four months for that one to be done.

And when that one came back, he recommended the only contact that should be allowed was he should be allowed to write one letter per month and she should be under no pressure to reply. So yeah, by going back to court, he lost even what little contact he was able to have.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6681s)

He lost even what little contact he was able to have.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6685s)

I mean, just to show how much he's actually bothered, he's done it three times. He's written three letters in what, two and a half years now? Since that second one came through.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6697s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6698s)

What he has fought for much more of course is child support and alimony because unfortunately the money is much more important to him. That has been a fight.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6713s)

Have you managed to get some though?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6716s)

Personally no, but he does pay child support.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6723s)

Okay, so it's for your daughter that, yeah. So you've never been able to get the money that you earned?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6728s)

 I got a small percentage of it, small percentage. It was dirty tricks all the way along when it came to money, dirty tricks all the way along. Things like they changed his, they immediately reduced his wages. I mean, I knew what he was earning. I'd taken his copies of his wage slips with me, but they, the first thing they did when they realised the way it was going was reduce his wages right down, right down. Yeah. They took my name off the partnership.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6764s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. So to try and describe to anybody who might watch your story, Ailsa, thank you so much for sharing it because it's harrowing in the extreme. What is life like now?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6784s)

Well, you've got your own apartment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've got an apartment. I've got a job. She's in school. Yeah. She's been through some rough patches.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6797s)

She will. Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6799s)

She's been through some rough patches. She really has. But she's doing really, really well at the moment. Really well. I'm so proud of her. I mean, the way she's coped is just incredible. Really is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D6815s)

She's got a lot of trauma to heal from.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D6817s)

Sorry?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D6818s)

She's got a lot of trauma, which will take years to heal from.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3d6zir1-YlA%26t%3D6821s)

Yeah, absolutely. It's ongoing. I mean, what I would like to say is, just in case there's any brethren watching this, the criminal case was brought to court last October, just a year ago. I wasn't there, wasn't invited, didn't want to go anyway, but I do have a full transcript of it. And I've actually only heard just recently that the brethren are still telling people that he was not guilty of all, he was proved not guilty of all charges or whatever the expression is.

I have the transcript. He pled guilty to everything he was charged for. He pled guilty. They couldn't charge him with everything because of lack of evidence.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6880s)

Yeah, not because it didn't happen.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6884s)

I mean the psychologist and the therapist and the social worker and the CPS, they've all said to me something else has happened, but unfortunately the trauma is so great still at the moment that it's not coming out, she's not talking about it yet.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6905s)

And has that all resulted in imprisonment?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6906s)

What they've charged, what they've charged him with, he pled guilty and he has, it's laughable really, he was made to pay a fine to a charity of his choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6920s)

Oh gosh. Which charity did he choose? Oh, okay, yes.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6925s)

Could anybody guess? Exactly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6931s)

I know, I know.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6936s)

And from a PBCC point of view, I'm guessing he's carrying on his life as normal, protected.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6945s)

Do you think the brethren would actually, the general brethren he mixes with, would really have any idea of the natures of the charges he was proved of generally?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6960s)

I think to a certain extent, yes. Yeah. But as I say, I do know only recently someone who recently left said they were in a break at the beginning of the year, which would have been three months after the court case was finished, and he was telling everybody at this break that he wasn't charged with anything, that he was proven to be not guilty, innocent.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6995s)

[Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=6995s), none of the charges were proven. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So you know, well they say if you tell a lie often enough you actually end up believing it.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7004s)

I mean, the sad part about it, the sad part about it is my parents haven't even been told the truth. I mean, my parents know because I've told them. They have been told by the brethren, they have been told nothing, absolutely nothing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7023s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I sincerely hope that people inside the brethren do watch your story, Ailsa, because like Anne, I'm certain your story's not unique. How we know it is, sadly, it's not unique. And I think your advice on what you can do about it, you do have a voice, you do have power, and it took you a while to realize that, didn't it? Through help from people outside the brethren, really. But the realization you do have the power and you do have a voice and there is something you can do, I just hope gets back inside there to anyone who finds themselves in your situation.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7068s)

Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, I know of other women in the same situation. I know of other women, yeah. I think, and you could probably confirm this, but as a person who's been through it yourself or going through it, you very quickly recognize other people in the same situation. And I know there are other women, I wouldn't be surprised if there's other men in the same situation. I mean, it's not, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7099s) abusers aren't men. No, no, no. And I'm pretty sure that the biggest fear would be losing children. Yeah. It was certainly my biggest fear. No, I've had two people reach out to me and that is their biggest fear.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7121s)

Yeah. Yeah. Well...

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7124s)

I think it's really important what you've said in reaching out to people on the outside. Yeah. Wish I'd known that. Absolutely. I didn't paddle my own boat, if you like, but yeah. I was very lucky in that respect, very, very lucky in that I had several family members, close family members who had left recently and were in a position financially and in every way to help me and to provide me with a landing pad.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7154s)

I think your advice about what to do, how to plan to leave, make lists and whatnot, everything you need to do and need to take, I think that's very useful advice for people inside there as well that are thinking of leaving.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7169s)

Yeah, I've just thought of something else actually that I did and that is when you've got the ability and if you've got somewhere to put the stuff and you've got the money to do it, buy clothes for the children. Buy, I bought, I think about three years worth of clothes for her, just every size, you know, as she was going to be growing, because once you leave, you don't have the means.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7194s)

Yeah, yeah, very good planning. I mean, it's actually quite heartening to hear the story that you've told us where you were supported and given sound advice that actually made your exit from A. the relationship and B. the brethren environment, harrowing though it was, it made it, I don't want to use the word easy because that totally, it's not, but it gave you that cushion that you needed.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7225s)

[It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7225s) made it possible, really. Possible, yeah, yeah, that's probably a better word, isn't it? It made it possible. And it meant that as you say, just simple things like you knew you'd have clothes for your daughter for the next couple of years because you'd stocked up on them when you had the means to do it. And it shows it can be done.

But I think it's also very hard because sometimes when people are in your situation, they don't know what to do and they've got, in the brethren, they've got no outside support because they don't know where to go for outside [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7255s) either to the authorities or to family members. And then what happens is a crisis happens and they have to leave in a hurry and that's, yeah, I mean, I know of cases where that's had to happen because the crisis came and they had to get out the house and that's when they literally have the shirt on their back kind of touch and then the court cases start.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7277s)

Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7278s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7282s)

Yeah, I mean, you know, over the years, every time I turned to someone for help from the inside, what I actually didn't mention is that that period when we moved to Siegen until we left, a period of five years. I mean, I tried to leave numerous times, numerous times, but unfortunately he was so, he'd cottoned on by then that I was capable of leaving. By the time I actually came to it, the keys were gone, the doors were locked, the windows were locked.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7318s)

Yeah.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7319s)

Everything was hidden. I had no physical way of getting out of the house. And again, you don't turn to the police. You don't ring us because that's what they, the first thing they said at the police station, I told them this, they said, well, why didn't you ring us? Well, what can you say? What can you say, you know?

And then the priests come, right? The priests come and then you're told, be more subject, you need to pray together, be more subject, you need to pray together, go to the meetings more, entertain more, be more subject. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7349s) know, there's no help, there's no help.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7353s)

No, there's no help. And the other thing I would want to add again to anybody inside the brethren, and this is probably a little bit more applicable to the UK, even if you're with a partner who is abusive but not physically abusive, so there's no bruises to show, you are still protected by, I know we've talked about it before, the coercive control laws here. So even if there'd be no physical attack on [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7384s), there are laws here whereby controlling your partner is a criminal offense and can be prosecuted.

And they include exactly the types of things you were saying, Ailsa. It's not allowing someone to see their family, not allowing them out the house, telling them what they should wear, controlling their finances, you're taking away their basic human liberties. And it's not so in every country, but in the UK, that if reported to the police, they could prosecute criminal charges, which may [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7414s) a bit extreme, but I think sometimes people in the brethren would probably not realize that.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7420s)

Yeah, actually I came across a quote this morning. It's in a different context, but it was, consent under pressure is not consent. I mean, that's in a different context, but it still applies, you know, in whatever context really. Yeah, so not just abusive relationships, but the abuse within the actual cult.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7445s)

Yes, yeah. Well, as we said when we had the podcast with Dr. Alex Stein, the behavior of the cult towards its members is the same as a coercive partner towards the partner that they're coercing, the same control mechanisms. Unfortunately, that isn't illegal yet. Not yet. We'll get there.

Well, Ailsa, honestly, thank you so much for sharing your story. I found it very, it tugs at the heartstrings to think of what you had to go through and I genuinely wish you go from strength to strength now. And your message to anybody inside the brethren who suffered as you and Anne have suffered was loud and clear and I hope they get it. And they can contact the info at get a life podcast email or the Olive Leaf Network.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7499s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7500s)

Or they can go to the authorities and we'll do what we can to help, won't we?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7503s)

Yeah, and also I would just add, even if someone is maybe worried about the financial costs of lawyers and court cases. I can't speak for other countries, but here in Germany, there are systems in place where somebody in that situation gets their costs covered by the government.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7525s)

I don't think that's the case in the UK, unfortunately, but I don't know. But that is fantastic.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7532s)

I've had my costs covered by the government. If you haven't got income in the UK, you can be assigned a lawyer.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7546s)

Only for a criminal case. So you might, in the case of Ailsa, you might get it in the UK because they brought a criminal case against your ex. But if it's a civil case, so it's just a custody battle and there's no criminal charges, but you can get a pro bono lawyer and a barrister for a criminal case, but not a civil case. So if it just ends up being a custody battle, you don't get the costs covered.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7576s)

Right, because Dan's daughter has actually gone through it at the minute and she's, yeah, custody battle, but she is getting paid. I mean, what do you call it? Call something.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7594s)

I don't know. I don't know in that case. But my understanding, we'd have to look into that one and find out, won't we?

### **Anne Hamilton**

I'll ask her, actually.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7603s)

Yeah, yeah. I know you definitely can get pro bono.

### **Anne Hamilton**

So, legal aid.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7611s)

Yeah, I thought legal aid only applied to criminal cases, but I couldn't be certain on that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7576s)

Right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7617s)

Yeah, yeah, I'm not a lawyer, so yeah, yeah. But no, thank you so much. We really appreciate you coming on. I know it costs a lot to speak out. We felt your pain, but also so glad you're free and you can build a life for both of you now.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7636s)

Yeah. Yeah. We're very happy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6zir1-YlA&t=7638s)

Yeah. That's good to hear. It's really good to hear. Well done. Thank you. Thank you. Good.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
