What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith, and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression, and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=55s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we are here with Beth Seed. Welcome back.

### **Beth Seed**

Hi Cheryl, thanks for having me.

### **Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Thanks for coming on. So any of you that are following Beth on social media will have seen her PBCC fact of the day, and so we are here to compile her facts of the day all in one place. You'll see different volumes of them come out, but I [wanted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=85s) to sit down and talk to you, Beth, on what inspired you to do this, what has the response been like, and to also hopefully inspire other ex-members to join in the fun that we're having.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=99s)

Yes, absolutely, the more the merrier. So a few things to start with. I have been shocked at what a, like, almost healing experience this has been. It's just kind of, it's very helpful to talk about things. I'm a talker, anyone who knows me knows that, and so it is good to just like get it out there, talk about it a little bit.

So how I actually got onto this was I had my 16th anniversary of leaving the Brethren, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=129s) I always, like, that's, you know how it is, Cheryl, it's a bittersweet day. You're celebrating, but you're sad. It's just a big day. And so I did a little video this year for the first time, just like saying, "Hey, you know, I'm celebrating 16 years. Like this is exciting." And I had so many people reach out to me.

And I mean, I've had it over the years, but more that day asking me questions about the PBCC, about the cult I was raised in, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=160s) they want to know more. And it got me thinking about how the Brethren are so secretive, you know, everything, we can't talk about why we do this or why we do that. I like, why is everything so secretive?

And I thought, hey, like, people want to know. I live in a very small town. That's where I grew up. And a lot of these people have literally lived next to the Brethren for their whole lives and don't know certain things. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=190s) so I thought, hmm, this could be fun. And I honestly never really planned on it actually being a daily thing until I started talking about it. And it was like, ah, I could do this for a while at one fact a day.

And it's been, it's been huge. The response has been overwhelming and super heartwarming for me because people have been very kind. I hate the way I look and sound on [camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=220s), but people have been great. They seem to love learning new things and have even said I love the sassiness.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=228s)

So I absolutely love the sassiness that comes with it. Like it's just, you know, you're sitting there watching them and you've got some remark back to what you just said, and it just makes you giggle from head to toe. It is very healing. It is so healing.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=245s)

It really is. And I do, I try and keep them, for one thing, I try and keep them short because we're busy, people are busy, they don't have time to watch a 10-minute dissertation, you know, or 20 minutes or whatever. But I also try and keep them a little light-hearted. Like once in a while, I had one where I was kind of a puddle by the end of it. But for the most part, I try and keep them fairly lighthearted and just kind of have fun with it. If we don't laugh about it, we [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=275s) will cry. So we might as well just kind of chuckle about it as we go.

You know, so I find it fun. It's been very, very healing, I think. So I do try and keep them lighthearted just because I feel like there's a lot of heaviness in the world. And so we might as well laugh about it or else we'll cry. And it seems to be working. People do seem to enjoy it. And I love hearing the responses from people. Sometimes the quote-unquote [worldly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=305s) people's responses just crack me up because it's so fun to see their take on something, you know, and what they thought. And it's like, oh, this is funny. You know, this is, this is good stuff. So, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=320s)

Do you find that a lot of the outsiders, like not even ex-members, but outsiders, like community members, are shocked by things that they've seen but never been able to have an explanation for? And now they're like, "Oh, okay." And their narratives begin to change, right?

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=340s)

Yes. Yeah. Yes, 100%. I have definitely seen that where they're like, "Oh, yeah, I always wondered about that," you know, "and that makes sense now." And, you know, it's one of the things, like, I really try hard to make it clear, like, I do not think that all Brethren are bad people. I would never want anyone to think that. But they are led by some very bad people.

And because of that, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=372s) have some very sick ideas in their minds. And I just, you know, my thing always is, if you're essentially supporting them and not questioning them and things they're doing and saying, they take that as support. They take that as support. They take that as you agree with what they're doing. And it's like, but do you, if you really understood the [level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=402s) and the lengths they'll go to, do you want to support that kind of group? Because I don't know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=411s)

It's, to me, you're enabling them, right? We have to stop enabling those at the very top, right? Yes. There is, I mean, I wouldn't, I don't consider my family bad people. There's some good Christians in there, but they're all been given these rose-colored glasses that say Hales across them. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to take these rose-colored glasses off so that our families and everybody else's family are given the opportunity to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=441s) able to see that they have a choice.

And I've said this before in many other podcasts, once you have a choice, if you're looking and you're liking what you're seeing, then stay. But if you know everything that's going on, I want you to know you have a choice to leave.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=458s)

Exactly. And that's, I think I had touched on it in one of my videos where I said, like, I would never straight out tell somebody they should leave the Brethren. I would never do that because I know how hard it is and you have to want to. But I also just think if you're questioning things, here's some more information you should have, just so you know. Like this is, yeah, a few more details you might want to consider.

Because I do [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=488s) like there was a lot of things I didn't know, that I didn't think about when I was leaving, and I wish I'd had this resource, you know, where it was like, yeah, I don't know. I just think, yeah, I think it's good to get more information out there and it's why I hope more people will do things, you know, that they will, that more people will actually consider doing videos and things like that, like getting, getting voices out there. It's a good thing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=517s)

There cannot be too many voices. And this is what I'm saying, like if you, so Beth is on TikTok, I'm on TikTok, I know Ben Woodbury is on TikTok, and Anne Hamilton is on TikTok, and there's a lot of vocal voices on there, but we need more. We need more. So if you're willing to talk and you don't have a TikTok account, that is my suggestion, is make a TikTok account, reach out to us, we'll help you with algorithm and all that kind of stuff. Don't do what I did, but do what [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=547s) did.

But it's getting all of our voices out there. We need as many as we can get. And again, like reiterate what Beth said, this isn't about taking down anything. This is about exposure. The amount of people that have come forward just off of Ben's TikTok and the people that have messaged me on my TikTok, and I'm sure like the amount of people that message you, Beth. Like it's allowing teachers to come forward, allowing hundreds of people who have [worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=577s) for them.

I think that's the biggest thing that I get blown away at, is the amount of people who have worked for them that have been just horrifically, I don't even know what the word is, horrifically abused. Yes. They want, they want these videos to be able to understand who they were actually working for and get the same kind of healing that we get.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=604s)

Yep. Yep. Exactly. Because it is, I mean, I have heard a lot of very uncomfortable stories from people that work for Brethren businesses and were not well treated at all. And you're right. It is a sort of healing for them too, because then they're understanding more about this group. And it's like, the more we talk, the more it gets out there, the more exposure there is. This is a good thing. They've been a very secretive group. They've done everything they can to stay under the radar. [And,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=635s) and I think it's good to just get it out there a little bit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=639s)

The exposure brings accountability. Yes. I've always said like justice is served in many, many ways. Accountability comes in many different ways. We've already had reports back at, they're even changing how they're praying right now. Whether that will stay, who knows, but this insider, and I'll actually do a video diary of this, but we had an insider that said like, "You know what you guys are touching on, they're hearing and they're trying to make adjustments."

Whether it's to save face, it doesn't matter. But I'm [glad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=669s) to know that, you know, right now I'm getting a break from being, you know, prayed to be removed from the planet. Again, it's like exposure can give us accountability in many different forms. And so if you are someone like Beth, like Anne, like Ben, I'm trying to think of everybody who's out there talking right now. If you're willing to do that, please reach out to us and we'll help you if you don't know where to start.

But we need the voices. We need the people. And man, I was just over the moon happy when I started seeing your fact of the days. And I like messaged you right [away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=707s). I'm like, "You need to do TikTok. Can you do a TikTok account?" Because it reaches so many people far and wide all over the country.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=714s)

Yes, yes. And that's the thing too, you know, I really hope people will keep watching and share them, you know, comment, share. It does, it pushes up the exposure and the more people that see it, the more people that become aware, and that's a good thing. That's what we like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=734s)

You don't have to message us and ask us to share. Share, share as much as you can. Just do it.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=739s)

Yep. I want it out there. Yep. It's yours to do with what you like. So, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=743s)

What would you say to the people, so I'm just going to go on the other side of things now. What would you say to those that think that we can't get over this or that they don't understand why we do what we do? What would you say to those people?

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=760s)

So it's really funny because this is, this is actually something you do get a lot. Like, "Yeah, you know, well, can't you just get over it, move on?" And my personal feeling, and everybody is different, as long as I have family that is still in this cult, I can't get over it because I will never not miss them and want them to be part of my life. And because of this cult, they can't be.

And so it's like grieving someone over and over and over again, but you never completely [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=805s) able to move on, if you want to say that, like a normal loss. Because it's just a reopening of the wound over and over and over. Because they're there. They're right within reach. And we just can't have access to them because we don't go to their church. And that is literally one of the hardest things for me is I'm like, I'm still the same person.

[Literally,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=835s) the only difference is I don't want to go to your church. I don't want to follow those beliefs. You know, how many worldly families do you have where a kid was raised Catholic and decides to leave the Catholic Church and go to another church? Does the family completely cut off contact with them? Maybe, sometimes, but not all the time. That is not a straight-out Catholic principle. It's not a rule that came from [above.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=866s)

Yes. Whereas this with the Brethren, it is. It is actually a rule that, no, they do have to not have contact with us. And it's like, so no, I won't get over it because I'm not, until everyone that wants to be free is free and until people are aware of what really goes on, there's still more to talk about.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=894s)

Yeah, that's how I feel too. When someone comes on TikTok or anywhere on any social media and says, "I've never heard of them before," then I'm like, "Yeah, we got to still talk. We still need to talk." It needs to become a household name. It, it's just one of those things that, same like you, I want to be able to die peacefully this lifetime. I want to get to the end of my life and know that I touched absolutely every brick of that wall that they built and know that I tried everything.

And it is a [group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=924s) effort. I cannot stress this enough. This is a group effort. So if you feel like you just need to move on, then that's fine. You just do your life. But I don't think that we need to be told to move on because to me, I've moved on quite well. But I will never just turn my head and turn the cheek, so to speak, on the family that is in there, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=954s) they don't know what they're in. Because these people have no clue what they are in. They don't know.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=960s)

They don't. And I think like even when I first left, I was so naive about a lot of the things, you know, that were going on. And so it's like, no, you don't actually see everything that's going on when you're in it. It's once you're out and you're free and all of a sudden, you know, it's like the blinders come off, like you say, those rose-colored glasses, and suddenly you see things a lot more clearly.

And it's like, yeah, this is, yeah. And I [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=990s) had someone, back to your comment about people saying, "I've never heard of them before," I had someone say to me, "I feel so naive. I didn't know they even existed." And I said, "Don't, don't feel naive. They have done a great job of flying under the radar for years." It's just really been since you started this podcast, since you started talking, all of a sudden it's gotten, I think, more of us talking.

And it's kind of inspired a lot of the rest of us to, "Hey, we're going to [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1020s) about this now. We want to be honest about what's going on." And so here goes. I'm just putting it out there. It's not going to be pretty all the time, but it's the truth and it's my truth. And it was the first 21 years of my life, and I can't pretend that didn't exist. It made me who I am.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1039s)

And I think it is so important to go back to saying like how it got you talking. I believe every single person who feels like they want to get up and talk, just because there's a handful of us talking doesn't mean that there's not room for you. There's room for you. We could have 300 of us all talking all at once on social media, and we still wouldn't cover the ground that we want to cover.

So, and I believe every single person gives a unique [flavor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1069s) Like Beth, yours are so, even when you're in tears, you're such a humble, authentic human being. You're like a living hug. That's what I want to call you. You're like a living hug that when you talk, from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, I feel you. And that's what makes this work, is when we get into our feels and we're, yeah, deep [caring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1099s) mode and it just spreads, right?

This isn't about bashing anybody. This is about exposure, absolute exposure, so that we can have accountability and change. I don't care if they don't fall down, right? Like it doesn't, that's not about that. We just need change. Yes, it just has to have change.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1119s)

Yep. Do better. Yes. Like if you still want to be a thing, great, but like you've got to, you've got to do better on some of these major issues. Yeah, I mean it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1130s)

It is, it is my belief, I do believe it's too diseased to change, right? I do believe that. But at the same time, miracles happen, and nobody, none of us should be judging any kind of a miracle that could happen in here. And so what our job is, is just to sit back and make sure that we are given the information that the way we need to do. And plus, it is healing. We get healing. I heal a piece of me every single time I come on here.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1161s)

100%. Yep. Yep. Because you talk it out, you hear other people's perspective and it, it helps. It helps. And sometimes it's as simple as, "Oh my gosh, you went through that too," or "You know what I'm talking about." It helps. It heals. Yes, it does. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1177s)

Oh, thank you so much, Beth.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1181s)

Yes, thank you for having me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1183s)

So blessed to have you step forward. And to anybody who's thinking of coming on board and doing this, please reach out to us. We will help you. It's very much needed, very much needed. So this podcast today is going to have her first set of videos attached to it, and then we'll just keep on adding her volumes, just like we're doing with Ben's TikToks. So thank you.

### **Beth Seed**

Sounds good. Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1209s)

And until next time, everyone, take care. Much love to you all.

### [**Beth Seed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1215s)

It's January 29th, guys. 16 years since I left the cult I grew up in, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Scariest thing I've ever done. Everything was new and terrifying. Everyone was new and terrifying. But what a ride it's been. I met some of the best people and I'm so lucky to have amazing family and friends in my corner.

I still miss my family so much every day, and I hope and pray that someday I will have them all in my life. But in the meantime, I'm so very blessed. Sixteen years\! Jeez, and I haven't aged a day.

Good morning\! So, after yesterday's post about it being 16 years since I left the cult I grew up in, I had a few people message me with questions about the cult, and I thought, hmm, maybe I should do like a fact of the day or something about the PBCC. So here goes.

There was so many that I could use for my first fact of the day, but I'll start with, so they have an early morning meeting on Sundays that they call the Lord's Supper. I, as a little kid, always called it bread and wine meeting because you have bread and wine, communion, basically. And so everyone there takes a piece of bread from a loaf of bread that's made with holy hands, also known as [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1326s) Brethren woman.

And it starts with the women and then goes to the men, and you all take a piece. Then it's time for the wine, and everyone takes a sip of wine from the same cup, including little babies. So like you're six months old and can barely even sit up and your mom is very helpfully holding the cup of wine up to you and you get to take a sip of wine. It's amazing those kids didn't like [sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1357s) for the rest of the day when I think of it. But anyway, so, fact of the day, bread and wine meeting. Now you know.

Good morning. It's time for PBCC fact of the day, two. Okay, so there's so much I could discuss about PBCC funerals, burials. But I'll just leave you with this. At least in the area where I grew up, and I think it was all over the U.S. like this. So when you die, the funeral director prepares your body and then off we go in the suburban to pick up grandma and her casket and bring her back to my brother and sister-in-law's house where grandma and her casket just hang out in the dining room until it's time for her funeral the next day.

Yeah, that actually, that's my grandma. That's what happened. And yeah, that's what happened with everyone. Not to my brother's house, but to like some family member's house. Maybe even your own house. So your memory of dad is him in a coffin in your living room. Cool. Very cool.

Good morning\! Time for PBCC fact of the day three. So as a girl or woman in the Brethren, I was not allowed to cut my hair. Could not color it or cut it. And I also had to always wear a token in my hair. When we were in the house or in some other Brethren's house, like it had to be like a ribbon or a flower or bow or something to that effect always. And if you left the [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1481s), like a casual, you're going shopping or something, like a little headband or scarf, like a knit head covering would work. But when we went to church, it was like a big full scarf.

I have zero pictures because I left and have no contact. But someday I'll find some pictures of what scarves look like. But anyways, these tokens, be it a ribbon when you're inside or a scarf when you're not, were so the angels would know how to find us because we were Brethren women and we needed protection, and this was the only way the angels would know that we were Brethren women and needed special protection. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1527s) I remember even being told as a little girl, my mom telling me a story about, I don't remember if it was supposedly over in like Australia, England, who knows where, a story about, yep, these two little girls were walking down the street.

One was a Brethren girl wearing a token and one was a worldly girl not wearing a token, and a bad man came and he abducted the worldly girl because the other girl had a token and he [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1560s) didn't even see her because the angels probably blinded his eyes from seeing her. Yeah, so these were the kind of lovely, threatening little parables that convinced me to always make sure I had a ribbon or scarf. There you go. Fact of the day three.

PBCC fact of the day four. Let's talk baptism. So the Brethren believe that you cannot attend a meeting or church unless you've been baptized. So like for a newborn baby, they can't go to meeting unless they've been baptized. And most babies, this happens like when they're about a week old. It might be longer if like say mom was poorly or baby was poorly, but normally it's a week.

Like it also normally happens on a weeknight. So like I was born on Sunday and my parents wanted me to be able to attend the next week's Lord's Supper because, you know, at a week old, I would be aware of this, of course. So I was actually baptized on Friday night. And so the baptism [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1636s) done by another Brethren man. Usually it's like someone more middle-aged. Like I feel like my dad was in his late 40s when he was asked to do his first baptism.

And I remember him being super nervous and like he practiced the baby's name like a million times with my mom before we went. And the only ones that attend the baptism are the family of the man doing the baptizing. So like in this case, like all of us, like my dad and mom and me and my sisters went. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1670s) then the family of the baby, meaning like it's dad, mom, and baby, and if they had siblings. So in this case, it was the first child.

And so the bathtub is filled and, you know, water tested to make sure it's not too hot. And the baby is, I can't remember, I feel like the baby just had like a onesie and a diaper, you know, whatever. I can't remember. I don't think the baby had like clothes or a towel or whatever. Anyway, and my dad said something, you know, like some words like, and then I don't remember how it all went, but it was like, "Then in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, I baptize you blah, blah, blah," the kid's name.

And then swoosh, head through the water and like back out and hand the screaming [newborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1724s) baby off to its mother who's probably terrified you were going to drown her child. And that's it. You're baptized. Good to go. Now you can go to meeting and you're saved. Like that's all it takes. Like you're too little to even be aware of any of this happening, but like that's it. Now you get a special place in heaven because you are a baptized member of the Brethren. Blessings\! So there you go, baptisms.

Good morning, it is day five and today for my fact of the day about the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, let's talk meeting rooms. So in the Plymouth Brethren, you do not call it church. It is a meeting room, or you go to meeting, you don't go to church. The only time you refer to it as church is when you are talking to the poor, uneducated, worldly people that [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1783s) know that we call it meeting. Then we call it church. Otherwise, it's a meeting room.

So the Brethren meeting rooms are like very big, square, windowless buildings. And they're broken into two parts. The first part is like the foyer area lined with coat racks and hangers for you to hang your coat. There's a men's bathroom, a women's bathroom, and then separate from that, further into the building, is a big square, dish-shaped [room.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1814s) So you have like a fairly steep aisle or aisles going down to the center, and this is the meeting room.

And the benches all sit in a circle, and your level of importance directly correlates to how close to the center of the circle you sit. So as would follow, women and girls are relegated to the back rows, and men and boys are closer to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1844s) center. So like the older, more important men, front row. Second row is like younger, probably married men, and maybe not married, depending on how big the meeting is. And then third row would be like younger, still boys. And then women and girls, yeah, they're just willy-nilly. You just, you're of no importance at all, so have at it. Sit where you want, as long as it's in the back.

Don't you be trying to go up front there with the men, you unimportant little peon. Anyway, it was always quite amusing to witness a man that felt that he should be front row, heading rapidly for the front row, which of course [was,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1889s) since it's a dish, smaller circle. There isn't as much room in realizing, "There isn't room for me on the front row," and suffering the humiliating indignity of being forced to sit in the second row, even though you were so important you should be in the front row. It was hilarious. Absolutely hilarious.

And you didn't just willy-nilly decide you were a front row guy. Like you had to be kind of like nodded down, like you were normally a second row guy and then a [front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1919s) row guy was like, "Come on down. You're the next contestant on The Price is Right." I mean, the front row of the meeting. Anyway, it was always an adventure. There you have it. Meetings.

Good morning. PBCC fact of the day six. It's Sunday, so let's talk Sunday in the PBCC. So as I mentioned in day one, Sunday started early. 6 a.m. Lord's Supper, always said the most important meeting of the week. And considering there was meetings every flippin' day, that says a lot. But anyway, it was also said, like, if you don't attend another meeting all week, like, at least attend the Lord's Supper.

So, that one where I was local, there was quite a few people there, so it would end up being like an hour to an hour and 15 minutes long. So you get home about 7:15, have a quick breakfast, and then if you were entertaining, which we did about every other week, it could sometimes be a little longer, but normally every other week, we'd be having like 20 to 25 guests for the noon meal on Sunday. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=1995s) my mom would have found this out on like Wednesday or Thursday.

Previously, she would have spent a couple days like cleaning her house top to bottom, starting to do food prep, etc. And so Sunday morning would come and after breakfast, dad would usually head off to bed, take a little nap, and mom and the girls would be running around doing the last minute, like set the table, final like wipe up the bathroom, vacuum the high traffic areas that, you know, according to my mom were [filthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2025s) even though it had been literally 24 hours since they were vacuumed.

Anyway, you know, final food things, stuff like that. And then it was time for the main event, Sunday big meeting at 10 o'clock. And you needed to look your best. If you were going to primp, that was the one, like you need to look good. It's a big deal. And where I was, our big meeting on Sunday included Brethren from Pembina, Neche, Winnipeg, Woodlands, [Stonewall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2056s) and was usually between about 500-600 people all together.

So it's a pretty big group. And Sunday meeting at 10 o'clock would normally last an hour and 15 to an hour and a half. If some beloved brother was feeling long-winded, it might even push two hours. And so you'd get out of there, you'd maybe visit a few minutes, but if you were entertaining at the noon meal, you've got some people showing up for food shortly, so you need [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2086s) get home and finish getting everything ready.

So we would scoot on home, help mom get everything ready last minute, and that was when dad's event kind of started because the man of the house is responsible for getting everyone drinks. And I do not mean, "Here, would you like a glass of water?" No, no. It's noon on Sunday. I mean, you should be having alcohol, thank you very much. And you might be saying to yourself, "Oh, but just the adults, right?" No, no, no.

I can remember like 16, 17, going to some lovely saint's house for Sunday lunch. And no, I mean, if I wanted a Canadian and Diet Coke, sure. If I wanted a glass of port wine, no problem. You want a beer? Absolutely. Have at it. All [yours.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2132s) Have a few. No problem. And so everyone had to have a drink before the meal, at least one, if not two. Then you'd sit down, have the meal, which was always a big meal. The expense on some of these younger households was probably huge because you're talking about feeding, you know, like I say, 20 to 30 people, an expensive meal every couple of weeks.

And so you'd have [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2162s) meal, some more drinks, because I mean, so you have to potentially drive an hour home afterwards. No problem, right? Anyway, then at about 2:30-ish, it would be time for everyone to move on because it was time for the next meeting. So off we'd go to another meeting. This one was a little shorter. Usually about, like, I don't know, 45 minutes to an hour long. You'd get done with that.

And then, like, in my younger years, I remember that being the end of the meetings for [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2192s) day. But then when I was like probably 10, 12 years old, it was said that the Lord's Day, Sunday, needed to be filled with the Lord. So we needed another meeting. So then we would have another meeting at like 4:30, 5 o'clock. And you'd finally be done with meeting and dressed up clothes, which I can get into in more detail at another time, at about 5:30, quarter to 6\. It was a long day.

And then you [potentially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2222s) were going out for supper that night to another brother's house where you would be sitting on a folding chair if you were a girl. That's another topic we'll get into more. Anyway, Sunday was not a very relaxing day, we'll just say that. It was actually quite tiring and by the end of it, you were just ready to be done. Day of rest, not so much. Anyway, there's Sunday in a nutshell.

So in response to Rachel's question about weddings and the Brethren, weddings have changed a million times just in my lifetime. So I remember the first time being that I remember a wedding was like 1993, and the weddings were very simple. The most important thing is the dresses have to be pure white. It shows [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2284s) purity of the bride. They are not supposed to be off-white, ivory, anything like that. They must be floor length and they must have sleeves.

If a bride gets a sleeveless dress, it needs to have like a jacket, shawl, something like that. There also must be a veil. So as far as hen nights and stag do, not really. I remember when my sister-in-law got married, like we got together and went and picked out her dress together, but [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2315s) know, there might be a very small, like get together of close, close friends that have like a very basic wedding shower, but that's the extent of it. As far as bachelorette parties, no, not at all. If there is, they're certainly not talked about because that would be considered very naughty.

As far as honeymoons, no. Normally the [extent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2345s) of a honeymoon would be like when there's special meetings where they're like over a weekend or something like that. They're usually held monthly. And so like the month after you get married, you'd be invited to said special meetings, and that would be your quote-unquote honeymoon. So not really a honeymoon because it involves going and staying with some other brother and in some random place and you might literally be on a cot. So [happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2376s) honeymoon. And yeah, that's pretty much the extent of it.

Good morning. Time for your next fact of the day. So today will be a quick one and it is just to say the Brethren do not allow pets. Growing up, I was not allowed to have a dog, a cat, anything of the sort. And from what I learned, they were allowed at one time and then in like the early 70s, the leader, Jim Taylor Jr. at that time, had suddenly decided pets were wicked and literally people had to get rid of their pets within like 24 hours.

Just here to tell you, if someone came to me and said I had to get rid of my cat tomorrow, I would be like, "Peace out\! Don't care about your religion. Bye\!" I'm going to hang with my animal, thank you very much. I like her more than people most of the time. So anyway, no pets allowed.

So in response to this question, I don't know if you mean if someone was to like visit their house or visit their church, but either way, I guess it's about the same. So if you were to like go and knock on my dad and mom's door, they would open the door, but they probably wouldn't invite you in. And like if someone needs to come in, like say to service their furnace or I don't know. They can come in, but they're not invited to eat, drink, anything like that.

If they're going to be there a long time, my mom would [sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2465s) make them food, but they have to eat it separately, like in a separate room. So it has to be very separate because they are the dirty worldly people. As far as if you tried to go to the church, that would be a no. So it's supposed to be an open church, but the doors are locked when all the saints are in. And if you tried to go in, they would not allow you to come in.

You can sometimes, like if you show real true interest in joining the church, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2496s) will sometimes allow you to attend a gospel on Sunday. But you have to be very, very serious. And very few people have managed to actually pull that one off.

Good morning. For day seven of my PBCC fact of the day, let's talk some terms. So I could probably do a lot of videos on random Plymouth Brethren terms, but I'll start with just a few basic ones. So the first one that you probably already heard me say a time or two is worldly. Brethren use that to refer to people. There's worldly people, which is probably you, you naughty [you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2538s) But that's people that have never been in the Brethren.

But also something else can be worldly. Like if I were to attend a movie, that would be worldly. So worldly basically means it's of the world. It's not Brethren. So that's a really common one you'll hear used. And then the next one I'm going to talk about is, well, it's kind of a twofer because it's confined and shut up. And they basically mean one and the [same.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2569s) It's where you are either in trouble with the church, so you're kicked out, or like in my case, when I first left, I was confined or shut up, because it basically means like there's still hope for you.

Like they're still hoping you're going to get right, per se. So like in the case of like when I was really little, my parents got in trouble with the church and were confined. And for people like that that don't choose to be leaving the church, they're essentially kicked out because they did something wrong in the church's eyes. It's a really crummy position to be in because you are not supposed to associate with Brethren. Like you can't attend meeting. You can't talk to Brethren. You're barely supposed to even wave at them if you see them on the street.

But you also aren't supposed to associate with worldly people either. So it's a very lonely position to be [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2627s) if you're someone that wants to go back. Then the next one that's next level bad on the going to hell train is being withdrawn from. So being withdrawn from means you are really bad and there's, you can still get right, but there's not so much hope for you. Like, you're probably well on your way to the going to hell train.

So, like, when my parents, well, my dad, not my mom, called to tell [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2662s) I was being withdrawn from, he first said to me, "Are you happy with the path you've chosen?" And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Okay, well, the Brethren no longer feel they can walk with you, so you are being withdrawn from." And I had said to him, "Okay, like that term really means nothing to me. That's a, that's a Brethren term. And I'm not Brethren. So I don't, I don't care that I'm being withdrawn from."

But then I did ask, like, "What is the basis the Brethren are saying they can no longer walk with me on?" And the basis, which is always their basis for separation, is 2 Timothy 2 verse 2\. They claim that that is their, well, just 2 Timothy 2, pretty much the whole thing, is their basis for separating from the world. And so once that was done, I am very bad. I have very little contact with any Brethren. My family has completely cut off contact with me. So there's a few terms for you. I'll have more.

Hi Rachel, so in response to your question about the weddings, they always have to be on Tuesday. Don't ask me why. I've never understood. I feel like I asked my mom this about 99 times in my life and never got a clear response, but they have to be on Tuesdays. That is an absolute requirement. Weddings in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have to be on Tuesdays.

As far as [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2764s) it an all-day event, this has changed so much just in my lifetime. So the first wedding I remember going to was in '93. That one was like in the morning and I feel like the reception, if you wanted to call it that, was like people stopping by the house of the bride and like that was kind of an all-day thing. Like you just kind of had food and snacks and treats and whatever. But then for [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2794s) reason they got moved to like now the weddings have to be like late evening, like the same time as the regular meetings, which would have been like 7:30, quarter to 8 at night.

And so then no, it wasn't an all-day event because you would finish up meeting at like 8:30 after the bridal meeting and like a late supper for the family. There was no like big reception, anything like that. Then when my brother and sister-in-law got married in 1999, they majorly [broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2824s) the rules and they got married at five o'clock at night. And so then after their wedding at like six o'clock, the immediate family and some friends went back to like the bride's home and had supper, kind of little celebration, if you will, reception, you could call it.

Then the weddings had moved to like three in the afternoon for a little while. Then they had moved as early as noon. The last I heard they were back to like mid-afternoon or 5 p.m. So it seems to kind of vary. I'm not really sure what changes the timing of it. I'm sure it's whatever their, you know, leader feels is the thing to do at the time, but anyway, not generally an all-day event.

Who actually goes to the reception, quote-unquote, is very restricted. Like you can't just have like a big party with all sorts of people. Like for my sister's wedding, which was right before I left, like it could be immediate family, and by the way, the groom's family doesn't normally attend if he's from out of town. So in her case, [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2893s) groom was from Seattle, so it was just his brother with him. None of his, like his mom, dad, grandparents, siblings, no, not at all.

So it's very weird that way. It's just the bride's side of the family generally. And we could have like, I feel like two other Brethren families could attend. And then we had a like friend of me and my sisters that the only reason she was able to come was because we listed her as a helper, which basically meant like she's [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=2923s) one putting the food on the table and making sure like everyone has drinks, etc. Like basically running the party, if you will.

So anyway, weddings have changed a ton. So I've been out 16 years, they probably changed a million times since then, but they are still on Tuesdays. And I'm sure they will always be on Tuesdays. And I am sure I will never know why.

Good morning. For today's Plymouth Brethren Christian Church fact of the day, I will tell you a little bit about growing up in the church. So I grew up with no radio, no television, no pre-recorded music at all, no cell phones, no computers. Technology was very bad. We couldn't even have cordless phones in our house. And then somewhere around like the late 90s, the Lord turned a corner, as he is wont to do. And cordless phones became okay, but you still couldn't have cell phones, radios, CD players. Yes, I'm that old. TVs, computers, anything like that. Very bad.

Well, then somewhere around like the, I don't know, 2005, 6, 7, 8, somewhere in there, it was like it kind of dawned on them that, "Hey, it's getting harder and harder to do business without computers." So the Lord turned another corner and they started being able to use computers and cell phones. And when I left, I had just gotten my first [Plymouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3025s) Brethren issued cell phone. I didn't keep that very long, by the way, a lot of handy dandy tracking software in those buggers.

But anyway, they very closely monitor like the websites you visit and things like that. They do all seem to now, from what I can see, they do listen to some music, but I think a lot of it is like their own. I don't know, people that have left more recently than me would know a lot more about that. But they seem to have embraced technology in a pretty big way [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3055s) people that considered it literally a sign of the devil in the 90s. So anyway, another little fact of the day and you learned something new. The Lord turns corners. Who knew our one unchanging God? Yeah, he changes just for the Brethren. There you go.

This morning for my Plymouth Brethren Christian Church fact of the day, I'm going to talk a little bit about separation. And separation is kind of a complex topic to get into. Honestly, I try to keep these videos short and separation could turn into a very long topic. So I'll try to break it down here into the most basic thing. So separation is talked about a lot with the Brethren. They will tell you that they believe that they need to keep separate from anyone who does not attend the Lord's Supper with them.

And their basis behind that, they have a few scriptures, but the one they love to use the most is 2 Timothy 2 verse 19\. And I actually went on their website, if you google Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and then click FAQs, they have one that is called, "What is involved in the doctrine of separation?" [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3125s) there you can look at the scriptures that they reference. And their basis of these scriptures is they will not eat or drink. So like if you're, when I went to public school for just a few years, we, all the Brethren kids had to sit at a separate table. And I believe they still, like even at their private schools that they have now, the worldly teachers are not allowed to eat with the children.

And that is strictly forbidden and enforced. So they believe strongly in the concept of separation and they, the scriptures that I read that they focus on talk a lot about unequally yoked believer and non-believer. That seems to be kind of their basis. And they would never say this, but to me, I read it as, it's not, how can you say that I am not a believer? [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3184s) is why you won't eat or drink with me, is because you're saying I'm not a believer.

Well, I am. I believe in God. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I don't believe in your man of God, Bruce Hales. I don't believe in any of your quote-unquote men of God. And so the Brethren basically are saying that since I don't, they consider me to be an unbeliever. And so like my parents would not sit down at a table and eat or drink with me. They would not break bread with me, [per](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3214s) se.

And this is something that I personally really struggle with because I straight out asked my mom one day, "So you can break bread with the man who sexually abused me and that's okay, but you can't with me?" There's no logic behind it as far as I'm concerned. I do not agree with this practice in any way, shape, or form. I think it's wrong. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3244s) everything about it is disgusting, but they hold very firmly to separation, keeping separate Brethren and non-Brethren. So there's the basics of separation, the very, very, very basics. Someday maybe I'll do an 8 million hour long video about separation.

Hi everybody, for today's PBCC fact of the day, I have one that I get asked about all the time. Let's talk marriages. Arranged? Not arranged? So I always tell people this is complicated, and I'm kind of hoping some of my other ex-Plymouth Brethren cohorts will chime in with their thoughts on all of [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3296s) So first of all, with marriages, they absolutely cannot be mixed race. You have to be the same race. This is not optional. And obviously the Brethren do not believe in same-sex marriage.

So then we get into the, are they arranged or not? And the reason I say it's complicated is, so say you're a 20-year-old girl, you meet a 20-year-old guy, you really like him, he really likes you, yep, this is a thing. You decide you want to get married, and as long as it's okay with the leader, cool, you're good to go. All set. Get married happily ever after. Divorce is absolutely off the table, so best of luck to you.

And that's all good, but you found [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3355s) guy, fell in love, it's going to be happily ever after, and the leader says, "Nope." Then it's nope. You're not getting married. Sorry about your luck. Hope you find someone else you like and the leader approves that guy, because this other one, nope, you're not getting married.

Then the part where I always get a little on the "are they arranged" part is, so I always think of like my sister, for example. She was older when she got married, at least in the PBCC world, she was 29\. And you know, was the marriage arranged? No, not exactly. But it's more of a, "Here, we're having special meetings," because there are special meetings somewhere every month, "and you're going to [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3412s) special meetings and this guy is going to these special meetings and you guys should talk." Yeah, like, and by talk, we mean figure out that you're going to fall in love forever and, yeah, we'll support it.

So like if you absolutely decided you didn't like this guy, could you say, "No, I don't want to marry him?" Yeah, but then option B is probably not going to be on the table for you and you'll probably be forever single. So sorry about your luck there. So that's where I say it's a little bit complicated because are you specifically told you have to marry this guy? No, but also if you're not given any other options, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3460s) kind of got to marry this guy.

Oh, and if you don't get married, you remain living at home with your parents. So like 37 years old and you're not married, you're still living at home with mom and dad. And personally, that sounds terrible to me. And I think it's why, you know, a lot of them do end up kind of settling in a relationship because option B is to live at home with mom and dad forever, and that's not the most fulfilling [life,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3496s) at least in my mind.

I mean, if that's what you want to do, hey, go for it. If you're happy doing that, great. But if you don't have a choice but to do it, I don't know, just seems to take some of the fun out of it to me. So that's the story with marriages. Like I say, it's complicated. Oh, and weddings have to be on Tuesday. I don't know why. I asked, never really got a clear answer, something about like x number [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3526s) days after the Lord's Supper, but I don't remember if that was even true or if I made that up in my mind because who knows. None of it made sense anyways, but weddings are on Tuesdays. Marriages are kind of, sort of arranged. The end.

Hey everybody, for today's video, I was trying for the longest time to come up with a cool, catchy title or what I was going to call this or how to even describe this. And I finally decided, I don't know what to call it. So I'm just going to say, I am going to tell you a little piece about my early childhood. This is not unique to me. This is something that happens to lots of Brethren. But it is my story.

So when I was eight years old, my dad was actually one of the local leaders for the Brethren. Didn't mean that he had any real decision-making power or anything. It was basically when you're a local leader, you're kind of in charge of making sure that the local flock, if you will, is following the rules set out by the world leader. So when I was like five, six, seven, [eight,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3602s) my dad was one of these leaders.

And so on March 31st, 1995, I was eight years old. It was a Friday night. We had supper and there was always about an hour in there between supper and needing to leave for meeting. And so all four of us kids, my brother and me and my two sisters, we all had headed upstairs to our respective rooms. My sister that was five years older than me, we shared a room. And I remember hearing shortly after this, someone had come to the door, but I wasn't really aware of what was going on. Like I say, we were upstairs. Who knows, playing games. Don't know what we were doing.

Anyway, I remember hearing [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3650s) mom coming up the stairs. And it's funny how the little things stick in your brain. My mom has really bad arthritis. And so she always relied heavily on the handrail. And it always made a little clicking sound. And I remember hearing it and thinking, "Why is she coming up? This isn't normally a time she would come upstairs." And she stood in the middle of the hallway and said, "Kids, can you come out here? I need to talk to you."

And she stood there and said, "Dad and I," I'm sorry, geez. I got to get it together here. "Dad and I are being confined tonight." And I was eight and didn't really understand the consequences of this. But she said, she's like, "Do you want to go to a meeting? We can't, but you can." And so my brother, who was the oldest, and my oldest sister, they would have been in their mid-teens at the time, said they wanted to go. But my sister Kathy and I decided to stay home.

And it was an awful, terrible time. My dad and mom were downstairs. I [could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3732s) hear them in the bedroom talking and crying, and I kind of just wandered the house not knowing what to do with myself. And then my brother and sister got home from meeting and they said, "Yep, dad was confined." And my grandpa and grandma were actually withdrawn from at this meeting because my grandpa tried to stand up for my dad and it was considered wrong. And so they were withdrawn from.

And so it was just a short time after that that the priests showed up, the new priests, and they said, you know, told my dad and mom, "Yep, you know, you have been confined and we think that it would be best if your children remained with the Brethren. So they can stay with you tonight, but then tomorrow they need to go to [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=3791s) Brethren's homes."

And so it was an awful night. I'll never forget it. And so we packed up our stuff and the next day my brother and I were sent to live with my uncle and aunt. And they had two children still at home, a boy and a girl. And my oldest sister was sent to live with an older married cousin and his wife and children. And my sister Kathy that I was closest to was sent to live with another Brethren family. And it was really awful.

And I remember asking the one priest, "How long do you think this will be?" And he said, "Oh, probably a week, maybe a little less." And in my little eight-year-old brain, I thought, "Oh, I can handle a week. No big deal." A couple months later, I ran away back to my parents' house and I told, I remember just strolling in the door and telling my mom, "Yeah, I'm back. Kind of over this. This was only supposed to be a week and I want to come home now."

And after some discussion with her and my dad, I was informed that, "Well, you know, we know you want to come home, Beth, but the only really right place for you is with the Brethren." And they sent me back. And three and a half years later, just after my 12th birthday, my parents were allowed to come back to the Brethren and we were allowed to go home. Some people call it illegal fostering. I call it hell. It's a horrible practice of splitting up families and it's just one of the things they do.

And I'm sorry, I try and keep these a little more entertaining. But I feel like people need to understand the truth behind them, behind the smiles and the quote-unquote good people. This is the doctrine that they follow. And it's hell. So I will try and be happier tomorrow.

Good morning. So last Sunday for my PBCC Fact of the Day, I told you about the day and how Sundays went. So today I'm going to talk to you about clothes, what we wore on Sundays, because Sundays were the most important day of the week. This was stressed to us over and over and over again. So myself personally, for that early morning meeting [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4003s) 6 a.m., and I think for about the last five years that I was Brethren, I wore the same thing to every single early morning meeting. And it was my most comfy sweater and skirt that I could find because it was early and I was always cold and I just wanted to be at home.

And so that never changed. But when it came time for the main event, the big 10 o'clock meeting, women and girls, that's when you pulled out all the stops. Like that was when your Sunday best came into play in a big way. And the Brethren are very, very much "keeping up with the Joneses" kind of folks. Brand names are important. Having the best, the newest, the coolest is important. And Sunday is the day to show off. Not that they would ever call it that, because they are not prideful people. That's silly.

So anyways, we [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4063s) spend careful time picking out our Sunday outfits. And from the scarf on our head to the clothes we wore to the shoes we wore, it all was carefully coordinated to make sure that we looked our best. And so for women and girls, that meant your biggest scarves, of course, with, make sure that brand name is showing in the back so everyone can see how fancy you are. And [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4093s) a nice shirt, skirt, dress, something like that, and then shoes, obviously.

And my personal favorite, not, pantyhose, the absolute spawn of Satan as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, wore them all freaking day long. Pantyhose are not comfortable. I have not worn a pair since I left, by the way. I will go out of my way to make sure that my outfit does not ever require pantyhose again because they are terrible. They are uncomfortable. They are hateful. And in the summer when it's 90 degrees, they're hot, very hot.

And so like on a Sunday when we were entertaining, I would sometimes, like as soon as I got home from the main meeting to like help mom get ready for the noon meal, I would run up to my [room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4151s) and take them off because it was like, oh, blessed relief. But then I had to put them back on for the next meeting because heaven forbid I go without. So those were the most hateful thing, but at least women had a little bit of like choice in what we wore. So it could at least make us feel pretty, I mean, if we could get over the pantyhose thing.

Men and boys, on the other hand, white [shirts,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4181s) black pants, that's their Sunday outfit. From like as young as two years old, that is what men and boys wore all day Sunday. White shirt, black pants, the end, that's it. That's all. No blue jeans or something wicked like that. Those were never supposed to go to meeting, but definitely not on Sunday. So if you ever see a sea of white shirts on a Sunday and ask yourself, "What the heck?" Yeah, it's not an optional thing. They have to wear white shirts on Sunday. So there you have it. That's what we wore. Sunday Best\!

Good morning\! Today for my PBCC Fact of the Day, I am going to talk a little bit about schools. Schooling and the Brethren has changed a ton. Just in my lifetime, which I know is getting to be kind of long, but still. Anyway, so back in the day, Brethren could always go to public school, it was no big deal. And way, way back in the day, like, I feel like 50s, 60s, somebody will maybe correct me, but it might even have been into the 70s, Brethren, men at least, could attend university.

However, like so many things, that changed. So by the time that I started school in the late 1900s, also known as 1991, I went to a public school for kindergarten, first, and second grade. And then starting in third grade, I went to a little one-room schoolhouse [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4296s) a block away from my house. It was through the public school system, but it was only Brethren children there. We had one teacher, the amazing Mrs. Julie Johnson, who, the things she saw and dealt with. Strong lady, one of my heroes for sure. She was there for some of the worst years of my life, and I'm, yeah, anyway, that's a whole other story.

But so, one-room schoolhouse, and I went there for grades third through eighth grade. Then when I was done with eighth grade, I was homeschooled ninth through 12th. And I consider myself to be one of the lucky ones because I had a very, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4346s) smart mother, brilliant actually, and she did not shirk in her teaching duties. She took it very seriously, and I hated every minute of it. And if I had known how much I'd be grateful that she forced some of this stuff down my throat, I'd feel a little bit bad for how much I hated it at the time.

But anyways, so I graduated with a diploma from a [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4376s) distance school. So now the Brethren have their own schools, OneSchool Global, I believe is what it is. It is a private school. It is very expensive. They wear uniforms, things like that. That was not a thing when I was a kid, but now it is. They still have their very strict separation rules, all of that, but they do still have worldly teachers because Brethren [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4407s) go to university now, so they can't become teachers, they can't become doctors, etc.

So they've kind of tied their hands and I'm just waiting for the Lord to turn a corner on that and university to start being allowed again because at some point they're going to recognize that, "Hey, these worldly teachers might actually be showing our kids that worldly people aren't that bad," and can't be having that. So it'll be interesting to watch how much that changes. But [anyways,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4437s) yes, I went to public school for a few years, then a little one-room schoolhouse, then homeschooling, and that was the extent of my schooling. No universities, they're wicked, don't know why, but they are. And that's it, schooling in a nutshell.

Good morning. For today's Plymouth Brethren Christian Church fact of the day, let's talk about Christmas. So you would think that a church that's called Plymouth Brethren Christian Church would celebrate Christmas, and you would be wrong. Absolutely not. So when I was growing up, we did not have a Christmas tree, did not have Christmas presents, did not celebrate Christmas in any way, shape, or form. It was just a normal day and we were not allowed to wish anyone Merry Christmas. We were actually told to not reference like the season.

So if we were going to say anything, we could say "Happy Holidays." That was the extent of it. So there was no, no celebration of Christmas at all. And I remember I was probably like 17 or 18 and my sister Kathy and I bought like a 12-inch fiber optic Christmas tree that we put on the landing of our stairs. And my mom was like, "Whatever," and my dad nearly had a coronary. And between the two of them, they finally [decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4525s) that it could sit there, but it had to absolutely be hidden away if we had company or anyone over.

And we enjoyed it thoroughly, you know, our huge 12-inch fiber optic tree. But anyways, I also remember, so my dad and mom owned the repair shop, auto repair shop in Pembina, which was the town right by where I grew up. And it had two big windows on the front, and my older sister Linda and I used to decorate those windows for all the seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4555s) this one year we took down fall at the beginning of December and we're putting up winter. And we, you know, had fake snow in the bottom like we always did, and we had a fake poinsettia, and we always hung up streamers.

And I decided, very wicked, to go with Christmas colors, red and green. And we hung those up, and I can't remember if I wrote "Happy Holidays" on the window in window paint or a wreath. I feel like it was probably "Happy Holidays" [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4586s) my artistic skills are just not quite to a wreath. But anyways, my dad actually got a priestly visit over that. The local priest came and told him that the window was too Christmassy and needed to change.

So that had to get taken down, and I was very offended by that. And I have to laugh now because when I drive down the streets in the small town where we live, the Brethren have wreaths on their doors now and on their Facebook [pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ko0IM3s28&t=4616s) for their businesses, which, again, they have Facebook pages. Oh, my gosh. Anyway, it will say, "We want to wish you a Merry Christmas." And all I can think is, "Oh, another corner turned. Cool." Now you guys can celebrate Christmas. It'll be just a matter of time before their houses have lights on them and trees in the windows, I'm sure. But anyways, growing up for me, Christmas was very wicked. So there you have it. Christmas in the cult.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
