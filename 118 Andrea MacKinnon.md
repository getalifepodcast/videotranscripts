### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist.

They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life Podcast, X-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

Hi everyone,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=55s)

Welcome back to Get a Life Podcast. I'm Cheryl, a former member of the Exclusive Brethren and now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and I'm from Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. Joining me today is Pam from Winnipeg who is also a former member and the aunt of our returning special guest today, Andrea MacKinnon Becker. Welcome ladies.

Today Andrea is here to give us an update since she escaped the cult with her family intact.

Andrea what an incredible milestone you just celebrated one year of freedom. We have had so many people reach out wanting an update and today seems like the perfect day to do it. The last time we did your podcast you were still in the PBCC. How do you feel now that you've been out a year and the big question everyone has is how did the day of leaving go on June 23rd of last year?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=113s)

Well thanks for having me back on. It's very nice to sit here and not be scared for my life. I have to go to meeting tomorrow morning. It feels very empowering to be able to sit here and have a voice and yeah be able to say how I really feel about everything. So absolutely leaving day June 23 2023\. So we yeah it was kind of a strange feeling because we planned it for so long, you know, and when [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=143s) there it just feels surreal, you know. And the kids had no idea. So we packed up and got in the car and we just told them we were going on a vacation. Right, I didn't question it too much because it's fun, great, you know, let's go. And so we decided the minute that we left our house we weren't going to look at our phones anymore. No more messages, no more phone calls. And they came all day long, messages. And so we arrived, we went up north to the Baltic Sea. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=173s) rented a little house up there and got there and basically sat down and sent the email. Oh, the strange thing is I picked up my phone as we were about to hit send and my mom called me right at that moment and I swear to this day it feels like she she felt me. Yeah. So I'm not gonna cry two minutes into the podcast but you know it was so bittersweet [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=204s) I had to say goodbye. We had to say goodbye. And it was a really, really peaceful week. It was, we almost went into like a zone of just relaxing. We explored this beautiful area that we were in, the kids, they just lapped it up. We had, you know, we weren't using any phones. We weren't using any social media. It was very peaceful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=229s)

Wow. So did you answer the phone call from your mom? 

No, I didn't.

No. When did you tell the kids and how did they react?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=239s)

So we'd been there a couple of days and I mean, looking back, you don't know whether you should have told them right away or not but we just, we just weren't mentally able, like it was such a huge thing to have to do in secret and have them there and know that we're changing their lives forever without any choice. We waited a few days to tell them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=258s)

And how old are your kids, how old were they just so the viewers and listeners and the insiders understand like what age of kids that we're dealing with?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=267s)

Yeah they're 10 and 6 at the time they were. So you know, old enough to be impressionable and really understand change. Yeah, yeah. The younger one April, she you know, she's more, she's never really liked going to meeting anyway, but you know, the older one is more sensitive and we just didn't know how they'd react. And so we, we told them on the beach actually.

We just thought it's kind of a peaceful place to tell them, right, you're out in nature and it was just kind of like a wild free feeling there. And we just told them and it was heartbreaking. It was really heartbreaking to watch them react because you know we'd made this decision, it was done, they had no choice and we know what that's like having choice taken away from us. It's not a nice feeling.

And you just hope that they were able to understand, but yeah so their reactions were mixed but as expected and it ended up that I sat with one daughter and Lyle sat with the other daughter and we just talked to them. It must have been about an hour, an hour and a half. We just sat and talked to them and held them and cried and tried to explain it to them and it wouldn't, in one way it was liberating to be able to tell our children all the weight that we'd been feeling, you know, the responsibility that we felt to give them better choice and better life.

And it didn't take that long until they, they just seemed to kind of accept it.

And then we didn't talk about it the rest of the day. We'd been on vacation for probably four days by then. We didn't talk about it the rest of the day. If they asked a question we would answer, but we kind of let them lead. And in the evening as I was tucking them to bed, one of them said to me, mom, it's just like life is this big beautiful thing and there's a door and we've just found the key.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=379s)

Oh wow, I have chills all over me.

Wow.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=385s)

At the level of intelligence and understanding in a small child.

It was beautiful and it kind of made me feel like it's going to be okay. You know, they're parents, they're going to be safe with us, they know now we're being open with them and it's going to be okay. And a year on I can just say that they have thrived beyond our wildest imagination honestly.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=412s)

Yeah, coming back to choice, like in altering their lives, the thing is is that we never had the choice of whether we wanted to join this church or not, right? And so you can look at it, so I'm not, obviously I'm going to speak to the insiders that are in there that are, that are in this predicament, the same predicament that you're in, is that look at it as you're giving them the opportunity to know what choice is, right? So here's the choice that we never had and we've been living in for all these years. I now want to give [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=442s) this other side of the coin and the choice and then later on you then you have this something to compare it to because right now there's nothing to compare it to because you don't have the experiences to bring forward to compare it to, right? Yeah, what a beautiful way though to think of like, yeah, you did, you did find the key to the door.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=459s)

Yeah and I kept going back to that and thinking of it through this past year and we really did, you know, and Auntie Pam can vouch for that. She's seen my kids and she's seen them blossom and learn and thrive. It's amazing and now they come to me and they, you know, we sometimes will have a conversation about over the dinner table, they both say thank you mommy and daddy, we know it was hard and it's hard for us too but we know that we have a better life now. Like they understand. And when when we started telling them like you know you go to a good [school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=489s) or you did go to a good school in the brethren, you know, because they got an education. But we told Freya, look at how many subjects you're not getting to learn. And she was angry. She's like, I I learned everything. I don't want to be told that I can't learn this and that next thing, right? I want to learn everything. And she got angry about it.

Wow, loves those subjects that she never had before at school. It's just fascinating and she's loved, she loves dance, she's done dance training for over a year and a half now and she's done football.

You know, and they've been in plays and choirs and...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=529s)

Going, what was your first week like with them as a family? What was that whole journey being, I mean obviously your phones were off the entire time like...

Expand more on what that was like that first week.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=543s)

It was very peaceful honestly. I don't think there's any other way to describe it. I think, well I would agree, it was just so peaceful.

It's really, we were staying in a kind of remote beautiful place in the countryside.

And lots of walks, we went to, you know, we did a castle tour and we went strawberry picking and went to the beach a couple times and played with the kids around where we were staying and it was just, it was so peaceful. Yeah, it's a movie theater which they couldn't believe their eyes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=577s)

Oh beautiful. What movie did you see? I can't remember which one it was. Yeah, it would have been their first time in one. Yeah, well we took them to a movie when we're still in the brethren. Oh, I love it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=591s)

I want to go back to, I want to go back to the beginning just for a moment before we move on only because we know that there's families in there that are getting ready to do what you're doing and I want you to walk us through what it was like getting in your vehicle and driving off knowing that literally was you walking the door. What was going through your stomach, what was going through your mind, what was that like? Try to [describe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=621s) it in a way so that those insiders that are leaving understand that what they're experiencing is very similar to you as a mother making that step.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=632s)

You're very overwhelmed with the responsibility that you're doing. Yeah, but I think that that's why it's so important to have a clear understanding of why you're leaving and to be, come to peace with it and to understand what you're doing for your children because you know as mothers if we allow ourselves to overthink we'll fly off the handle, right, and rack ourselves with guilt about our children which we kind of do anyway but yeah we, I just kind of tried not to overthink it too much. We just got in the car and packed it up and of course they're always there, right? So the kids are always having to pull you back into mom mode.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=673s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=673s)

Dad mode and you just have to be bright for them, you have to be cheerful and happy and normal for them but it's very sobering. It's a very, you're you're terribly afraid because you don't know what's going to happen and you've been taught your whole life to fear everything and what has even come into the ministry this week, literally Bruce Hales said in his in his ministry in some of the ministry book that's come out it could, it's the worst thing that you could ever consider doing, going away from the testimony [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=704s) so this is ingrained into you for your entire life how terrible it is to do this stuff that you're doing. So it's very, very scary but the interesting thing is, and this is what I would love to tell everybody in there who's thinking of doing it or listening to this for the first time, it's incredible how fast the fear goes because you feel...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=726s)

Oh that is so beautiful, like that is so important for everybody to hear that because it really shows you where the lies and the truth really is because the truth does set you free. It's just a matter of getting through that door and then, and sitting in another option and your soul just relaxes, right? You're, our soul knows what's truth [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=757s) what's lies, but the thing is is when you never get the opportunity to be able to experience that, I mean and that's why the cult is set up the way it is is so that you don't get those tastes of what it's like, right? Yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=769s)

And it does take time. It really does. But it's incredible how once you've made up your mind,

and you know we're all different as humans. Some people might sway with their decision and think have I done the right thing, have I not? I personally have never doubted my decision.

Because once you have that responsibility of taking children you can't just go back and forth with children. You have to, you have to show the example, right? Yeah. And once you lose the fear you can lead them with confidence and openness and trust and they just feed off that.

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=806s)

It really is that moment you leave, I described this on a podcast just recently, it is one of, it's the worst day of your life and it is the best day of your life, right? The worst part is because you know what you have to say goodbye to and that's not the testimony, that's not Bruce Hales, that's none of that. It's saying goodbye to your family. It's saying goodbye to connections that you've relied on your entire life. And it's also the best day of your life because [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=836s) gaining that connection to your own self.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=841s)

Absolutely, yeah. And you just wish you did it sooner. You know, you wish that you weren't so afraid and yet I was at all those stages of fear but once you go, it, even one year on I still am trying to lose, get rid of that last little bit of fear, but it comes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=862s)

Wow, so you have no fear at all. Yeah. So when you get back from that, you turn on your phone, what were the messages like? Okay, that's, there's two separate, there's two sets of messages, right? There's messages from us, there's messages from your Auntie Pam, there's messages from Lane, there's messages from all of us that knew that this was happening. And then there's also when you get home and you turn on your phone. Can you describe the paradox in both of those?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=891s)

Yeah there was, there was so so many and a lot of them were just kind of sad obviously people who didn't know what to say and they, you know, people that we've left behind and we didn't want to hurt, with no intention of hurting. We still love them the same as we did before we left but you can't take them with you, right? And so they send you these sweet messages and it just kills you because yeah you can't go back just to, just because they say to, right? And they don't understand because they've never been in your, they've never, they haven't seen through it. So they just think, oh well just please come back, you're going out into the big bad world where there's wolves that are [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=930s) eat you or whatever is in their head, right? Yeah. So you're implying to them and you understand that you just feel sorry for them. There was some pleading ones, some quite interesting one. One said to me, please don't leave us alone in here, you know. And, but the ones that were the most shocking was from my family. Yeah, or the lack of. [My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=962s) dad and mom, just my dad sent, he said, well that's stupid.

That was his message. Like, oh thanks for fighting for me dad, thanks for asking me what, what made me make this decision, thanks for asking me what you could have done to help me. Well, that's stupid. Yeah, it is stupid. You're stupid. You know, like it's so unintelligent and unfeeling and uncommunicative and it's like they've written me off.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=990s)

Yeah. I think that's the hardest wound to get through. That is the hardest wound. And even me, I've been out like 30, 32 years, it is still the wound that I go to therapy over, right, is when like when I left my dad just hung up the phone on me, they never came after me. It's just so, and it's not that you want them to, but there's this part of you inside that was like, really? That's just it? That's just it? It's just...

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1016s)

We don't want to know what happened? You want, don't want to know what helped but made us get to this point? You know it's not only me, yes it was Lyle and me individually but it was us as a family.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1026s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1027s)

And out of all my massive extended family, only three wrote me and more of my friends, yeah, in my own own family. And their messages were more feeling and more detailed because they actually knew me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1044s)

Pam, what was it like knowing that she got out and you get that first text and it's like, okay, we're out.

### [**Pam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1051s)

What was it like for you? Well, it was so funny because Rob had messaged me or something. He said, someone's going to be sending you a message and her name is, I couldn't remember, I can't remember the name that you used, Dandrea, but I said okay and I said, oh who is, what was it? I used a pseudonym name. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. And so anyways, um I said, oh who is it? He said, well I can't tell you but this is what name she's going to be using. And then Lane had also said to me too, yeah I'm helping someone. I said, who? I think it was Lane. I, yeah it would be Lane or Rob. And I said who? He says, I can't tell you but you know, I'll let you know. [Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1091s) I hate that, I want to know, but that's a good point insiders because confidentiality is everything. If you contact any one of us, we're never going to tell even each other your name. Yeah, because I thought okay, I had to suck it up and um so anyways one morning I get this message from this girl and I said oh, I, she says oh hi, not Auntie Pam or anything, and hi, and uh and anyways I said okay I knew I was gonna hear from you but who are you? who is this? so I knew this a few seconds later I get this picture of Andrea and Rob and Laura.

I'm going, Andrea, I couldn't believe it. It was so cool. It was just so, and it's just so great to have Andrea back in our lives and Lyle and the girls. I love those girls, they're just the sweetest ever. I went to, yeah so it was pretty shocking and exciting but knowing she lived so far away, it was like, oh my gosh, like I have to go see. So a month or so later I said, you know, I think, I know I need to see you [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1165s) I think you need to see me too. And Andrea says, oh my gosh, are you really going to come? So I, I went. I like booked it and left in like six days and uh it was, let's see, I could start crying but seeing you at the airport, it was just, it was unbelievable. Uh how many years had it been? 15 for me that I hadn't seen you.

 Yeah, yeah I don't know, well how long have you been married you guys? We got married in 2011 but I last saw you in I think 2007\. Yeah, it's a long time when I was out of the brother in the first time. Yeah, yeah. I went to uh Germany and met the family and I tell Andrea this is one, it's one of my best holidays. I just felt, I felt like I was going into my daughter's house, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1222s) know. Oh wow, that's beautiful, right? And so proud of them and so loving and it was just oh it was just so great, you can't say enough and the girls were just like, just love them so much.

After a while they were saying grandma. Oh Auntie Pam, I just called you grandma. I said, that's okay.

Sorry Betty if you're listening but you know, well she hasn't made the effort. No effort. I believe in that's Christian, that's Christian. Oh my gosh.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1261s)

I can't believe it. That's how it works out here is we do, we we gain, we grab our families. You don't mean you just put them back together and I mean it is, it's the perfect role for you to step in as a grandmother to these kids because I mean it's there.

### [**Pam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1278s)

Yeah and I and I talk to Andrea like most days. Hey Andrea, even if it's for like three minutes or something. It's just incredible. My life like for all of us, but especially you and me, like we've always had such a special bond and we just we're so similar, we just click. You're so much like me. Oh, my mom does that, you're so much like my mom.

But I love that, you know, it's fun too. You feel that part of my heart that needs filling.

You too, you too. And what a beautiful family you know, like Lyle is just so calm and cool and just they're just, I just love them. Love you guys. Great to be with them. I'm going in another week, yep, to see them. Oh, I love it. Yeah, and I'm bringing my daughter who Andrea has met when we were in Florida. She came to Florida to have a visit and uh Olivia was there so we're going out on the 14th.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1342s)

Oh so much fun. How are you finding life now Andrea, now that you've been out for a year? You just guys just celebrated your one year anniversary of leaving. What has that one year been like? How have you integrated into society? What is, what's it like? Explain to us as if an insider is listening to this on what that first year is like.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1368s)

Like, you know you have so much learning and unlearning to do it's incredible and I don't know if you ever stop really, you can both probably vouch for that. But you just have to give yourself kindness and actually you know, my good friend, our good friend Ben Woodbury said to me, no one's going to take care of you better than you.

And I've always remembered that because if I'm not taking care of me, how can I take care of my husband and children and anybody else who's in my life? So you have to be, you have to be patient and kind to yourself. You have to let yourself feel those emotions and savor those moments. And when you have a bad day, sit with it, let it ride, write it down, talk to someone, but it's okay. And I think that that's something I'll never take for granted being able [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1418s) feel all my feelings and not have to constantly suppress them. You know, insiders that are still in there, you you don't know who you are until you start letting yourself feel everything and it's incredibly important.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1430s)

And from a female's perspective from being in there, let's talk a little bit more about these feelings because are you allowed to feel your feelings in there as a female?

Not if they're uncomfortable. Yeah. Nope. There's this facade you have to wear, right? And I think one of the biggest things in there is the busyness, right? As a female, whether you're a mom or, I mean, I was younger, but it was just so busy. It was busy, busy, busy, busy that you never were given the opportunity to be able to sit and feel. So it's very much on very different levels, right? Where it's like no you're not allowed [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1472s) show these emotions, but on the other hand it's like you're too busy to even feel them.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1477s)

Yeah and I think that that's part of the tactic that the brethren don't realize that they're getting sucked into and they find it very hard to push against it once they're trapped in it is saying no to things and allowing yourself to take time for yourself and it's very important because how else are you going realize what you're in unless you step back from it for a minute and that's what exactly the system doesn't want you to do. They want to keep you so deep from morning till night that you have no time to think beyond your basic [needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1507s).

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1507s)

What was it like having empty time and empty space and time that wasn't consumed by things? What was that like for you when you first recognized it and how did you embrace it?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1524s)

You just savor it. I just savor moments. I, it, you know, it feels like time slows down because you're able to really enjoy it, freedom, and you don't have to rush anywhere. Okay, yes, you got to rush, you know, get your kids to school or get to an appointment. You don't have to rush anywhere. There's no pressure to make dinner at six o'clock or 5:30. It's just being able to savor and you have to tell yourself that that's okay. You have to learn to let go. You have to learn to embrace it, you know, and it's you nobody [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1555s) even in people that you interact with now, like nobody expects anything from you beyond what you're able to give and they just, people just accept you for who you are. It's it's very, very freeing and it feels like you're finally living, you know. It's like there's no control over you. Yeah, right under, there's nobody's controlling you. Absolutely. And it makes you very self-aware because you're in full control of your actions. You can't, I mean, you can't go completely crazy every day, [right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1585s) But. Oh, you can.

It does come with consequences though.

You know, but I don't want to go completely crazy every day, but you just have the freedom to wear your pajamas to take your kids to school or go out and get a breakfast at the bakery and not care about getting home to do your jobs at the Campus & Co or whatever. Like it's that feeling of fear that I go back to. You just, it let you, it dissipates out of your body and now when you feel the fear, like for instance if something triggers you, it's very, very powerful and you recognize it immediately and then you go back [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1622s) that's how I used to feel all day every day. This pressure on your head, this pressure on your chest, this panic of time and you don't feel it anymore.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1635s)

How does it feel to be free of the judgment, like the gossip and the judgments? To me that was so hard like when I first left, I mean I was 17, but at the same time as you get into this world and it's the same thing, you think everybody is judging you when they're not because that's what we were so programmed. There's such a judgmental veneer that you have to wear inside there. What was that like for you to be able to come out and be free of that judgment? Like how did that affect you?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1670s)

Yeah so it is very liberating and it's taken me a long time to get to the point where I really don't care what people think about me but it is incredible and what where it comes from is you meet people and you know I was always very highly anxious and highly stressed out and highly rushing around all the time because that's what you have to do in the brethren and I would meet other moms who were moms of my kids friends, right, and they were just so chill and there was no stress and I'm realizing, oh because they [haven't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1700s) had that pressure in their life since they were little, they haven't learned that they have to cope with it and they're calmer, they're stronger, they don't judge you. They don't, they haven't felt judgment like I felt, so they don't judge me back, you see. Yeah. 

And it was when I realized like I would go in to someone's house to pick up my daughter who had been there for the afternoon and the mom was completely calm, you know, she was wearing whatever, the house is just whatever and they welcome you in. There's no pressure and and just that alone is, was such a good lesson for me like nobody judges you. You know, then you then you get brave enough to invite them back and you don't have to go clean your whole house. You can just, I love it. Yeah, you need a coffee and your kids are running around and it's incredible. Yeah, it's incredible. And you know, you're free to experiment with what you look like and do your hair and [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1754s) piercings and you just don't care who sees you at the grocery store. If a brethren lady sees you, well good, hope she sees how happy I am, you know?

Have you ever run into a brethren at a grocery store? 

Yeah, often. But I think they're avoiding our village now because we don't run into them much anymore. But I sent you a screenshot, right, of one interaction that I had.

Somebody that I ran into, well, I didn't actually run into her, but I saw her across the parking lot and I got this extremely confronting message after. I'll explain this to you. I'll give you a bit of context. So um I was pushing my grocery cart to the car and I wanted my kids to get in the car because I had to go park people around behind my car to load my groceries in the back.

And so I said get in the car and I was just making faces at them and smiling at them and you know, entertaining them a bit as I pushed my cart around. And I could see a brethren lady with her car a couple rows away. And I could see her looking at me. And I just kind of glanced over there and carried on doing what I was doing. And, you know, like we were just talking about judgment, you just don't really care what people think of you. So, you know, you're just, you're just living your life. You're happy.

And anyway, she must have thought I was trying to look at her from afar or something. I'm not quite exactly sure what she thought because you know PBCC women are very paranoid when they're in public. They feel very afraid. They run in and out of the store and they go to their car and they're like, oh I'm safe from the world again. So they're very paranoid in public which I can, I felt like that myself, right? Yeah. So I got this message and she, so this is the message that I got;

‚Äú‚Ä¶ [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1861s) many years I thought you were a friend. You betrayed me and many of your friends. Having today confirmed me that I don't want to be near someone that creeps on people like you did. It is very, very childish what you are doing, Andrea, and it's you that is suffering. Nobody believes that you are happy. If you have to say that you are happy, then really you are not. You have no remorse, I fear, for those two beautiful little angels you have. When you change your way of thinking, I will be there for you, but like this, it's a no-go. You are [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1891s) a teenager, you are a full grown ass woman and you should act like one.I know that this is all because you were depressed. The solution is to not to stay in that state for long, otherwise the devil gets at you. It is never too late to come back.‚Äù

Now there was more to that message before and after but that's the part that I thought was relevant to share because my feeling was very, I was very hurt by that message because this was written by somebody who had moved from overseas like me and I had done nothing but be kind and take an interest in her and go out of my way to drive her places and take care of her, you know, not ask for anything in return and that's that's what I get, you know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1938s)

Absolutely horrible. It shows though how brainwashed the women are in there, right?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1946s)

Yeah, it's very exposing and, and you just I just felt, I just still feel so sorry for her. It's terribly triggering for me to to even see it again because it was so offensive to me that she tells me how I feel. And if you have to say that you are happy then really you are not. Well, that's not her right to say and I wouldn't say that about her.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=1970s)

And the thing is is just to even say you're not a teenager. So by you having your freedom and having joy, which is what she would have seen or have been seen is she's seeing you happy and joyful. To them that is us being a teenager. That's not, no, you can be a grown-ass full woman and be joyful and be playful and still not have to be, you know, this subdued female in this world [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2000s) just, you don't mean, that just goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, it's responsibility, responsibility. Hell no, you can get out and have some fun. I plan on having that much fun when I'm 90 years old, so you know, yeah, take it as a compliment. Be a teenager.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2017s)

Well, and that's the thing, how dare she she say that you were creeping on her, like is she weird or what? That's terrible. That's awful. You know I realized it looked a bit funny like I'd taken my grocery cart round another park car to go to my trunk and oh okay, I'm sorry I glanced at you. I didn't realize that it was, you know, it it would offend you if I glanced over at you and it really, you know, I came home and I told Lyle about it and he said she can't understand seeing you happy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2044s)

Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2046s)

Yeah because I mean I did talk to her the last time, she's probably one of the last people I talked to in the brethren and I was incredibly stressed because I was just dying to get out of there, right.

Yeah, you know, depressed. I was depressed because I was in the brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2062s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2063s)

And I couldn't leave.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2064s)

Yeah and how's your depression now that you've been out a year? It's gone.

You look like you're 10 years younger and a teenager so own it.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2081s)

I'm a grown-ass woman. But you know it's incredible and I keep coming back to the fact that it's very few people, only I would say Lyle's parents who actually asked us what happened, what made you do this move, you know, how are you, are you okay, could you have done anything? It wasn't the people that I thought would ask those questions. The people who I thought would care wrote me off and told me, you know, talked down to me and told me that I was making the worst decision of my life. And I was taking my children to hell and all these things. So I'm actually going to read out a message that I got from my mom a few days after we had left the Brethren. And she says;

‚ÄúYou can't have me and leave the fellowship both. It seems like you've made your choice.‚Äù

And so I responded to her with this;

‚ÄúSad that my mother's love is conditional. You know I'm the same person as I always was, but haven't been happy for a long time due to an ever-tightening system of nonsense. A restricted life with no choices isn't a life and is irresponsible to raise children in. We are here to talk as always, but for now, need some time as a family.‚Äù

It's really surprised me the reactions that I did or didn't get from some people. Like even my own sisters, they just, like, four sisters, one of them wrote me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2162s)

You know, you really, really realize, I think this is the part of coercion that I, the laws that I want to be changed is because when when a religion has this kind of control over its members, family members, that when you choose to just not simply go to that church anymore,

it is cut off. Like these are the closest people, these are the people you grew up with, these are the people that parented you, these are the people that you expect to have your back with whatever obstacle you go through in life and you leave and boom, it's cut off.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2203s)

It's just still okay by me, but I feel betrayed by them. Exactly. Yes, you even ask me how I'm doing. That's what you've said, Auntie Pam, that makes you angry, like that none of them, none of them fought, none of them asked why. Yeah, nobody cared. No, you're really, yes, yeah it's it's it makes you so feel sorry for them because they don't realize what they're in and there's such such control. Yeah, and they don't have a voice, do they? No, none of us [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2233s) a voice. You know, just because we're women, why can't we, why can't we have a voice? Of course you don't have a voice when you're in the PBCC, not if you're a woman, right? I want to touch on that, about bringing up my kids in that sentence because, you know, I've got two girls and in the brethren, they're the weaker sex, right?

Their life span is go to school, get an office job, get married, have babies, then what? And my kids have blossomed into independent, self-sufficient, confident and self-aware girls. Love it. It is incredible. And that's one thing I would say to anybody on the inside thinking of leaving. That's the key is stay close to your kids. Stay close to your husband. Be open with them. It is fascinating the stuff that they'll tell me now. So [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2283s) kids will literally say to me like, mom, you're cooler. We can talk about everything with you. You know, and that's the kind of kids that I want. I want to know they can come to me for anything because yes, I was very, very close to my mom, but you know that you can't tell your mom everything because you're going to get judged and you're going to get told to put away those feelings or whatever or they're not right. And I'm really, really proud of how far my kids have come and how, you know, all of us come as a family, like we're we're a [family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2313s) unit. We're together and raising these girls to be independent and strong and self-aware and you, you're discussing things together, Andrea, like I see that with you guys that you're discussing at you and Lyle and making decisions and and they're very, very like you're really in tune to how you're raising your kids and I love that. You know you're smart, you're really smart. I always tell Andrew you guys are such great parents and you're such a great mom.

### [**Pam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2344s)

I agree. I just, like I don't know a lot about what's gone on, but I do know Cheryl what you went through and what a lot of other young people are going through in the PBCC and I said to Andrea, if nothing else, if nothing else, you're saving your girls from that. Yeah. And to me that would be the biggest reason to leave. Yeah, you're right. You don't have to, you don't have, I mean you always have to worry about but their support, [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2374s) like they're supporting it, they're not doing anything about it. I couldn't imagine, am I correct Cheryl in saying that that type of abuse is still going?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2384s)

Like I think anybody who has any girls in any area of the world inside the PBCC, if you have a girl, get the hell out. Like 100 percent. You guys I wished I could share my inbox. That's what I wish I could share but I can't so I just need you to trust me when I say that this is systemic in there. This is everywhere. It's not just in Maple Creek, it's not just where uh Lara Payne was from, it's not just where Beth Seed was, it's not [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2414s) where Abi was at. It is, it's everywhere. It is absolutely everywhere. I'm not sure if you've watched the podcast that we just did with ‚Äúgrowing up in polygamy‚Äù and Richard and I was on it and of course we all know Richard just tells a little bit more of a story, a little bit more of a story on everywhere that he goes. It's not always in one place. And I even learned more about it. So if you haven't watched that podcast, he touches a bit on it too that I was, I didn't even know about. It's everywhere. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2445s) if you have a girl, and I mean it's not, I shouldn't say that it's just isolated to girls because we know that, right? But right, yeah, it's not just isolated to girls but it does seem that the girls are targeted more, right? Because they don't have a voice. So it's it's easier, right? More vulnerable. 

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 

So Andrea, we talked quite a bit on the phone and I marvel at the way you [guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2475s) transitioned from in there to out and the way that you guys have navigated it all, the way that you guys have stuck together as such a unit that it just, it excites me when I hear of other families leaving because what you really gained is you gained what it felt like to be a family unit. Inside the PBCC you are not a family unit because the man is held over top of the female, the female does [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2505s) have a voice, she's busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. We have children that they just don't get to put their wings out and fly and feel what, what are my passions? What is it that I'm really passionate about? You don't gain that until you leave.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2521s)

No, and it, like you're right when you, what you say, you don't know what's in the family unit, you know. And something that we've actually just found that we so enjoy is is being an actual you know like we share, we share our team but that's normal in the real world, that's normal. You know, yes, but they're, they grow up where mom might be on a weekend away with a friend or dad might be on a weekend away with a friend or dad's taking one of the kids away and because dad has his own personality in life beyond his family and mom has her personality in life beyond the family because that's normal. They're individuals and then so when you come together as a family unit it's that much stronger [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2565s) then you want to be a team. I feel like I'm not explaining this very well but when you are able to find out who you are, you're a better part of the family. Yeah, yeah, I think I can say that for my kids too. Like they, we are so incredibly close. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2583s)

No, we're not perfect, you know, we have our moments. Oh no, nobody's perfect. We live in human bodies with human emotions and human experiences and all of that polarity that we all go through, right? Nobody's perfect. And it's not saying that family units are all perfect out here but coming from what we were in inside there to coming out here is there's just this bittersweet, it's just a beautiful thing to watch unfold with your family. 

I, because I've been up close and personal in front at front with it and it's just, there's sometimes I go to bed and I just marvel at if this could be a domino effect from what you did and to be able to express it and show other people of what it, what it's like. It's not, you are a better, you are a tighter unit out here than you ever will be inside there because [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2638s) there it is held together by somebody else. It's held together by rules, it's held together by this robotic system that doesn't allow you to bring your heart and soul inside it the way that when you leave and then you bring it out, it just glues everything together.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2658s)

And really, you know it, I think it's so important that people understand that they can't, they're never going to know what it's like unless they leave as a family. Exactly. Yeah. Of course it's scary but wouldn't you rather be able to discover all what life has to hold than to just accept a path created for you? No, really, you know, when you think your child could be something in this world and make a difference or you could, there's so much, there's so much opportunity. And the thing is [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2688s) that we can also train our children, we can protect our children better than we ever could. We can train them better. They're very, very aware of everything now whereas before if you try to train your child against some of the excuses that happen in the brethren, your child would tell someone else, yeah, they get in trouble for it or whatever. Whereas now we can train our children and what happens is as open as you can be with your spouse and your child, you're tighter, you're more, you're that closer family unit, right? Yeah, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2719s) yeah, you're not governed. Yeah. And what it does is it makes you just appreciate everything. It makes you appreciate those walks on Saturday morning in the in nature and just you know, going out to get a pizza or going out to just sit at the lake. You just appreciate it. Or heading out for the weekend.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2732s)

So like have you guys got a chance to travel? Have you guys done any traveling since you've been gone, since you've been out?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2741s)

A little bit. We have had actually a lot of trips. We've had some family trips and some solo trips and yeah, we've been really lucky. Uh the last fall Lyle went to England to visit some of his uncles and spend a weekend there. So that was his first solo trip. And then we went to Montreal for Christmas to Robb's. And we had our first family Christmas with the tree and the presents and the, you know, the snow. And it was incredible. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2772s) was really incredible to spend and have a first proper family Christmas, right? And give the kids that experience with their cousin. 

And then we've um then I went on a solo trip to Florida and to Alberta and saw both of you. So that's not you and that was something that I had been dreaming of for I don't even know how long, probably since I'd had postpartum depression after having Freya. I dreamed about having time alone and I kind of never understood [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2802s) but I just wanted time to figure out who I was. Yeah. Outside of a mom. Yeah. And it's not that you resent your role as a mom at all. No. And the brethren, you're, you are a mom and that's it. And really we're so much, we're so much more than that to be a good mom. Right.

Yeah. And it was, it was really transformative. And I felt like, Lyle and me have felt like every trip that we've done has helped us further in our healing. So traveling is very important and you don't have to go far, but just go somewhere and have experiences with your family.

I love that. And you went to a ballet? Yes, we did. We've done many cultural things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2843s)

I'm going to pull some pictures up here. Let's go through some of these pictures you sent.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2848s)

Okay, so this is a pre-leaving picture, as you can see, but we thought it would be interesting to show everybody what it looks like when you're sitting in a Zoom meeting in the Brethren, which, by the way, they still do.

So Lyle's in the front because he's the man, like he's the man and I'm in the back with the girl because we're in a submissive gender with our scarves on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2870s)

Look how different you look. I just have to point out you literally are glowing now compared to this. Totally, like you can feel the weight of the world in this picture on you versus how you look now. Yeah, she doesn't even look like this person. No, it doesn't look like the same person.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2889s)

The funny thing is is that we would never be wearing shoes because why, why, you don't have to show your shoes, you know. Yeah. Half the time April would be here sitting behind Lyle because she was wearing some sort of get up that she put on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2905s)

She wouldn't. I love it. Oh that's so good.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2909s)

Podcast in this room, you know. Yeah, I'm front row. Yes you are anymore. I'm the spokesperson.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2918s)

Yeah, you reclaimed your throne.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2923s)

Okay, so this is actually the day we told the kids that we would left brethren and this is in the evening. Oh I got chills. This is just to show you the beautiful Baltic Sea.

Wow, that's beautiful picture.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2939s)

Oh you guys can always already feel it unwinding off of you in this picture though, hey?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2944s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2945s)

Shorts, flip-flops.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2947s)

Beach, yeah.

So this is a ballet and the Nutcracker ballet in Germany and before Christmas and it was just such an amazing cultural experience to take the kids to. We were all, even Lyle just sitting there with our mouths open just amazed at these beautiful dancers and you know, it's like a craft.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2970s)

Yes. Yeah.

And what an introduction to the kids, right? To just because they're not, they've never seen things like this of what you can do with your life beyond just being a a mom and a server to other people, right?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2982s)

Yeah, and it exposes them to just all sorts of

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2986s)

new things.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=2987s)

Broadens their mind and makes them... Oh, that's a great picture. So this is at Christmas in Montreal with Robb and his partner Laura and their daughter Bianca and we went up to the Mont Tremblant mountains and watched the skiers and spent Christmas there with them and it was, it's just incredible to have family. You just appreciate them so, so much. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3012s)

Yeah, able to catch up with family because how how you remember them in the church is like, I mean they've evolved and they've grown, right? So it's so good that you got to catch up and you know, meet, you know, your brother who's a completely different person than he was when he was in there, right?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3030s)

Absolutely because there's no more, there's no more having to hold back who you are.

Yeah. So yeah you just appreciate each other for exactly who you are. Yeah. And we heal out here like that's I think the biggest thing and the biggest opportunities that leaving gives is leaving gives opportunities for growth, leaving gives opportunities for healing, right? It's just, and that you can't put a price on that.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3058s)

No. So this is in March. We went to Munich in Germany for a weekend because Lyle had spent a lot of time in there on business and he really loved the city so he took the girls there and this is at a circus. It was just incredible again, another cultural experience of, and the acts were from all over the world and they did such amazing things. One girl even hung upside down by a hook in her hair. Oh wow. Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3089s) was incredible. Really amazing experience.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3091s)

Look at the girls are really glowing though, you can see that they're really integrating well. Yeah, they really are. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3099s)

Ah, love that. We went back to the Baltic Sea to the same place where that previous picture was taken and this is our one year leaving trip. We decided to celebrate it as other people have told us to celebrate it. We asked girls, would you like to go back? And they said, yep. So we went back and we just did the same thing. We just hung out at the beach all day and kids played in the sand and we just reflected on our year.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3128s)

That's so beautiful.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3130s)

Oh I got chills from head to toe. It was amazing to look back over the year we've had and and have the girls look at us now and say thank you for what we've done for them. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3141s)

Because now they can appreciate it and in with experiences behind them, right? So you said you went to Montreal for Christmas, were you able to see any of your family that are still in the brethren on that trip?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3153s)

Yeah, I actually went to see my mom. Oh wow, how did that go? Well, not well. Yeah, I bet not. In my in my eyes, but so I just, I felt this feeling that I needed to go and see her because she's old and I didn't, I didn't want to miss that opportunity. You know, I really felt hurt that she'd never asked me how I was doing and I've sent her multiple emails with no response and I just, you know, I wanted, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3184s) wanted her to hear what I had to say and I don't think that they knew that we were there. Anyways, I just, I went, I left my kids in the car and just went and rang the doorbell.

And she was obviously very surprised to see me and I went forward to give her a hug and she wouldn't put her arms around me. Oh wow. And I think I kind of was like, I wasn't kind of letting myself get emotional. I wanted to stay clear-headed and say what I wanted to say and I just told her, mom, I just want you to know that I left because I was so unhappy. We left because we were so unhappy.

And it felt like when I was talking to her she wasn't really listening to what I was saying. She just was going to answer what she was going to answer anyway. You know, like I could say, mom, there's a meteor coming and it's going to land here in six hours. You just go, okay, well, when are you going to come back to the brethren?

You know, and over and over, I said to her, I was just so unhappy, mom, you know, and she's, and I said, I reached out to you for help. And I asked you to come and visit me. And I asked you to help me and you didn't come. And she said well I'm sorry for that, which I'm grateful for because many, many times I asked her to just come visit me and it took a lot for me to ask for that but you know she doesn't want to leave her husband, it looks weird, and she doesn't want to come to my house because it looks [weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3269s) like, and then you gotta, you know, it's always about what other people think.

Anyways we did just, we did talk for about another five minutes or so and she asked where we were staying and I said with Rob and that didn't make her happy. And I said, but he's my brother mom, like. And that's her son. Her daughter is staying with her son and she's not happy about it. Wouldn't she be happy that I'm staying with my brother and being loved?

And she asked where the kids were and I said they're just in the car at the end of the driveway.

Anyways I I left and she stood there. She didn't come down and see her grandchildren.

Oh, oh wow, wow, wow. Oh my heart, you know, when she had the power to come and say hello to them, they're innocent children. Nine, you know, eight months earlier we'd stayed at that house for two weeks.

And now I wasn't even able to go in the front door.

You know, and I, I actually was very surprised. I got in the car and I said to the girls, wave at grandma, because I thought, I'm not there, I'm not going to let them act cold. Yeah, you want to wave at grandma? And they said, yep. Why is it, why does grandma look sad? And I said, I don't know, it's her problem, right? I was surprised though. I got, I got real closure from that because

I felt sorry for her. It really hit me how indoctrinated she is. Yeah. When I went in, when I, when I first greeted her, after we hugged, she said you've turned your back on the Lord Jesus. And I said, Mom, you don't know that. How do you know my link isn't with God, isn't stronger than it ever is?

And I said, I don't believe in the man that you believe leads you to the Lord. Mr. Hales leads us through the scriptures. And I said, no, he doesn't. He's controlling you and you can see it. And I'm not going to accept that way of life for me or my husband or my children any longer.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3394s)

And yet she's not seeing that she's turned her back on you, right? Like that's the part I think that's the hardest part and I sit with this often because of what we do, right? I mean we do a lot of work behind the scenes. The podcasts are like 10% of what we do and I often sit with myself when I go to bed or if I'm waking up in the middle of night and can't sleep or you wake up first thing in the morning and you always want to make sure because I mean I have my own, I have my own full-time job. I've also, you know, taking care, still have a husband that's sick [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3424s) you, you have just this little tiny time or these hours during the day that you're multitasking to put towards this movement and you always ask, you have these questions of like, where can the time be best served, right? And this is the one thing I think that hurts me the most is it's how we get cut off from our parents. It's how families are just split in two.

And my heart is just breaking right now just listening and just witnessing what it would have been like for the two, your two girls having to witness that, right? Like it's just, what can we do? Like that's what I asked, like what, what can we do to stop this? I don't know what we can do to stop this other than just to continue doing what we're doing and exposing what we know. A lot of people are seeing through it, but then there's those, there's those very grassroots [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3481s) that don't have a voice, that are so fully, every cell of their body is believing in the ministry that's coming out.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3493s)

And I will say like, I I do think my dad and mom are kind of old school hardcore. Yes, might yet, like Lyle's parents have been surprisingly open to listen to talking to us and they actually still currently see the kids on a monthly basis.

And we've made sure that it's a very, you know, a safe environment for them and they don't talk about things that will stress the kids out or trigger them. And it's actually been going okay because at the end of the day if they love my children and they're making the effort to see them and be interested in them, then they deserve their time, right? And if I can make sure my children are going there and they're safe and they don't come back upset, then I, then it's okay.

My mom lost her privileges because she didn't make any effort and what happened is that the kids don't talk about her or miss her anymore because she effectively erased herself from their lives. Yeah, away from this meeting. And I was very shocked at myself. I didn't cry and the kids didn't cry and it was just like, okay, I've said the...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3556s)

Realization of what you have to accept.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3560s)

Yeah. I've just got to feel sorry for you. You say that too Auntie Pam, don't you? You just feel sorry for them.

### [**Pam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3566s)

Yeah, for sure, I do. Well yes, we're angry at them sometimes but I just feel sorry for them. I don't know how long ago it was but maybe 15 or so, maybe 20 years ago, I get a call from my mom.

And I was at work. So that led into them coming to visit me in Winnipeg. And so there was my mom, Gordy and Betty. Then I got to go down to St. Vincent to see my sister. And it was wonderful, you know, it filled such a void. But at the same time, I knew why they were doing it. They just wanted to clear their name because of the way they had treated me.

After a while it was um just kind of went by the wayside but I always kept in contact with my mom and it was so sweet like I'd phone her and she, we just chit chatted and my son went to school in Montreal at that time so I would go out to visit him and I'd always go to see my mom, have a little visit. And at one time it was funny when you're talking about being totally cut off that he was showing me the pictures and I'm going like [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3638s) said to her, why are all these pictures in these photo albums like they're all cut? It was me they cut me out. Nice. Like I was dead and I remember finding one of you and being like, who is this beautiful person?

So anyways I um anyways, mom, my mom was, you know, she was getting sick and and ill and And so anyways, we had been talking and one day Gordie phoned me and he said, I think he called me or I called him, but whatever, it doesn't matter. I just said to him, well, how's mom doing? Oh, she drives us crazy.

I'm like, you're serious? And he said, you know, it would be better if you just didn't call her anymore because you have nothing in common.

I said, seriously? Nothing in common.

So I said, she's my, she's my mother Gordy, she's my mother. And he said, well you just have nothing in common. It would be better not to call her. And he was calling me at that time because Andrea had been in Winnipeg and she had left the brethren at that time and they were wanting her to go back and they just wanted to know what she was doing, where she was. And you phone and ask her like, you know. So anyways yeah, so I talked to my mom after, I [hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3725s) she's not going to get in trouble in heaven when I tell you what she said. You're like, don't get in trouble mom, it's okay. But uh I called her after, I said, mom, did you not want me to call you anymore? You know, she goes, why, who said that? And I said, well Gordy told me not to call you anymore. She said, don't listen to him, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Well, I want you to call me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3755s)

They do say that families have the right to, like that they say that in articles all the time that it's up to the families whether they want to have a connection with you. So if your mom wants to have a connection with you then she cannot get into trouble for it.

### [**Pam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3767s)

Well we had the connection and yeah, and it was great. I loved it. So but yeah, she was really upset about that and you know, she was old, she's in her 90s, right? So who is my dad to say that you can't call your mother? Yeah, and she's a pain in the butt or pain in the neck or whatever he said. How rude. I would like, I would have loved to look after my mother. Yeah, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3797s) would have loved that.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3800s)

But poor thing. Yeah, but that was rude on your dad's part. Just so rude. And it's just, it's just this thing that you know, they think that they, they're so arrogant and they're actually very immature. You know, they think they're very um underdeveloped because they haven't learned real life situations. Yeah. He's not putting himself in your shoes and saying I, because I think what [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3828s) um you were trying to get a hold of grandma and you couldn't or something so you called dad or whatever, you know. So maybe he, oh here I have my chance to tell her not to call him. Well it's not his right, not at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3841s)

No. So moving forward, Lyle was working for a brethren business when he was in, right? Yes. And how is he still, is he still there or what's he doing now?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3854s)

So he doesn't work for a brethren business anymore, but so when we came home from Montreal at Christmas, we gather that somehow his brethren employer found out that he was staying with Rob, an opposer, right? And this began the process of him getting fired. Wow. It had been kind of overnight. It was very sudden.

And it's not like Lyle cared to leave there. He didn't want to leave there, but he wasn't going to quit because there's no reason to quit. Right.

And he asked what the reason was, like, why am I getting fired? And he's like, well, you don't need one. We don't need one.

So interestingly enough, he had other ex-employees of this business, non-brethren members reach out to him and say, oh yeah, you know, this is how it's been for us and this is how they're treating us. So we took it to a lawyer

and after a couple months they had to sign documents saying that he'd done nothing wrong and pay out. That's awesome. The point proven. I mean he could, they could have paid him one euro, wouldn't have mattered, but you have to admit that you, that he did nothing wrong because he didn't do anything wrong.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3922s)

And it's religious discrimination because he doesn't, he doesn't agree with their views anymore, right? Like here in Canada that's not allowed. Like you could, you cannot do that.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3933s)

No, and he didn't even have to pull that card in the end because they had approached him multiple times and he had the proof, he had the emails, he had everything and they even tried to get him to sign something without explaining what it really was. So, wow, you know, thank goodness he had a nice month off and really started to heal and now he's at a good job that he's really loving and he's able to move on. You know, he's not in the environment every day. He's not being dragged into [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3963s) and he's at a job where he's being treated like he's valued and appreciated and seen and he just, he's he's so happy.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3972s)

That's beautiful. That is so good. Have you had people on the inside within the brethren reach out to you now? Like do you, like does Lyle ever hear from anybody? Do you hear from anybody?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=3983s)

Um well it's mostly been since our my podcast came out which was that was end of May which has been very, very interesting because I've kind of laid low until then, you know. I wasn't ready to release it and you know, when you're putting your story out there it's a big thing. So credit to everyone who's ever done one because they helped me. So since putting out the podcast, we've had a lot of people reach out and most interestingly was wives who have, wow, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4013s) they watched my podcast and it's made them realize that they don't have to stay in that system anymore. That's awesome. The veil is lifted off their eyes and they they see through the system now and they understand that there's a better choice in a better way. It's it's an incredible feeling to be only one year out and to be already able to help other people leave.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4040s)

It's so incredible but I, like we knew that this was going to happen by showcasing what you guys did because it was, you're the most recent family that has come forward and everybody can relate to it. It shows people that yes, this is possible.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4060s)

Yeah and it's, you know, it's by sharing our stories that we help. It's how it helped me, by hearing other people's stories. You know, where however small you think your story is, if it helps someone else, then it's worth telling it, right? And correct, it's a very liberating feeling to know that by being vulnerable and sharing your own story that it can help someone else.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4082s)

Yeah. What what tips would you give any families that are wanting to leave now that you're one year out? You've sat back and you've reflected. What what would you what would you say to them?

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4097s)

Well firstly I would say if it's possible, discuss everything openly as a couple. Like this is super, super important and it will take you time to learn how to do that because you're so used to not sharing that kind of stuff deep inside, right, like doubts but the fellowship or whatever. But discuss things openly. Make a list of pros and cons honestly. Get a journal. Just, this is my journal. It's nearly all done now. And make your list of pros and [cons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4127s). You'll be surprised at how many pros there are of leaving. Get outside support. You know, it doesn't matter who it is and you know, another fellow ex-brethren member or somebody you met at the bakery this morning, whatever, get outside support. It's really great to have people to bounce your ideas off of. You can do it anonymously online. All of us leavers are happy to help you if you want to contact us anonymously. Just let us know you're an insider and that you don't want to say your name. We're all really happy to chat.

I have a lot of people request me on social media and they don't want to tell me who they are, but I'm happy to help.

And try to write down how being in the brethren makes you feel.

So you can kind of try to understand your feelings for leaving, if that makes sense. Does it make you feel good when this is said? How does this meeting, how does going to meeting make you feel? How does what they say make you feel? How does doing all these things that they expect you to do make you feel? Write that down. It's good to have that for later.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4186s)

I want to pause there for a second because that's a very, very powerful point that you just said. Our feelings are like our fuel to our truth, to the fuel to our soul. When you allow yourself to feel, you then give yourself this brain waves. All this choice happens in the brain, right? When we start connecting the brain to the feeling, it's super important. We start seeing where we're brainwashed. When you are [brainwashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4217s) or when you're in a cultic group, the first thing that they want to turn off is the feelings and we're talking about the feelings that are really deep down, the feelings that allow us to maneuver through life. So when you allow yourself to feel, all of a sudden you start gaining access to what you really think.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4240s)

Yeah, that's a really important point. Incredible what you can uncover about yourself too and it's very, very important to have that written down. Yeah. And watch the Get a Life podcast. There's so, there's 117 podcasts full of information and there was only 60 some when we left. I don't, I don't know the number but you know, all of those helped me, helped me see through the system I've been in. It's incredibly valuable. Go back and watch them from number one and read books. There's [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4271s) many books written by leavers. There's Mark Chapat and Adrian Patmore, John Spinks, Craig Hoyle, Rebecca Stott. I ordered them all on Kindle

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4281s)

and I just devoured them. I'm just going to add another book that's coming out in here. It's a, it's a book that's coming out I believe in November. Um you can look it up. So the book is called Out of Faith. It's by an ex-member. It's called A Mother, A Sect, and a Journey to Freedom. So then that's another really good book that people can um you can pre-order it now and very much will be full of information that will help especially the females and the mothers.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4313s)

Beautiful. So another good tip is to get your children registered in public school. It can be done in secret. You can do it behind the back of OneSchool Global. They're not going to find out. We went to the public school and told them the situation, sat down and explained it to the principal and they were amazing. They reserved a place for our oldest daughter in public school and contacted OneSchool Global and it was a seamless transition. Wow.

And another point is very, very important is you might want to notify the police of your decision. And this might sound dramatic but there's a reason behind it if you have children is that you don't want the brethren to come after you and say you're of unsound mind, you've kidnapped your children or you've been, or you've disappeared. It's much better to notify them and just inform them of your decision. They'll take your your identification and your children's identification and when we [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4373s) the policemen said, oh yeah, that group. Yeah. And crazy, made it feel very secure that we knew that we had that to fall back on if harassment come or people coming to our property.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4390s)

We had that, they're already notified of it. Like that's such a good idea. And especially for those people who might not want to send an email back to the brethren that just want to just leave. I think that's super important that you do it there because then it's the police have been notified. Nobody can go to the police and be like, this person's missing or these people are missing. The police are like, yeah, no, actually they're not. You don't owe them anything. You don't have to leave a letter. You don't have to send an email. I mean, you can if you'd like, but you don't have to.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4419s)

No, you're not tied to them. You're not legally bound to them. You never signed any paper saying that you're a member. You do as you wish. You can send an email if you want. We chose to, but you don't have to. But it's, you know, we've been extremely grateful for that advice and always know we've had that to fall back onto.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4437s)

Yeah.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4437s)

And talk about, try to make sure that your finances are not too entangled in the brethren which is a huge thing and if they are, make a plan. Try to emotionally pull away from friends and family. It's not an easy step but it's basically a protective measure and how you cope with leaving. And it's important to learn how to not rely on them so much

because you've got to stand on your own two feet. If you're going to leave, you have to be prepared to do that. And there will be new friends and family who will support you. And just some other tips are, you know, you don't have to do what they expect you to do. You don't have to have company. You don't have to volunteer at Campus & Co. You don't have to drive the bus, which I understand is terribly scary to say no to because I was there myself.

But find your reason, step back, give your time,stand up for yourself, take the baby steps and see how you feel when you choose yourself over the demands that are expected of you.

And make a list of little ways to integrate into the real world. You know, just be more friendly to people that you encounter, chat with other parents, join a fitness class, all these tips are things that I did that helped me immensely and try to make a plan that is able to be changed if your plans change.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4524s)

Oh that's beautiful.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4524s)

Yeah, don't be scared if things change. Don't be scared if you have to go. We just wish we did it sooner.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4529s)

Yeah, wow that is so beautiful.

### [**Andrea MacKinnon Becker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4535s)

And yeah, the last, the last thing I would say is we would highly advise you to just go and take trip when you leave. You know, you don't have, you don't have to tell the brethren. You can, some people write letters, some people don't say anything, but go and take some time for yourself because you'll need it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4552s)

You know what, I, you guys are such, you guys are the prime and perfect example of how to do this. It is just and I mean, I loving that we're hearing of more families that are leaving. Um I hope that they come forward when they're ready because everybody, every family that gets out intact will have different ways and they've altered things here and there and we need to, we need to hear of these things. We need to be able to present them to everybody else that's still in. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4582s) if you're a family that has left and when you're ready, please message us, email us at info.getalife@proton.me so that we can help all the other families that are sitting there with one foot in and one foot out. It's super important.

I just, I really, really want to thank you, Andrea, so much for coming on and updating us all. I mean, I know that you were being bugged to do an update. We were being bugged to do an update. It really helps inspire other families. It shows them that this can be done. We know that your story, we know that it has helped others in leaving successfully. Thank you, Pam, for joining us and for all the support you've offered Lyle and Andrea and the kids. And I want to leave you all with a reel that they created on their one year [anniversary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4629s) that says it all. I want to remind you to like, comment and subscribe below. Check out our online store that helps support Get A Life and thank you to everyone for your continued support. Much love to you all.

You're going to realize it one day that happiness was never about your job or your degree or being in a relationship. Happiness was never about following in the footsteps of all of those who came before you. It was never about being like the others. One day you're going to see it, that happiness was always about the discovery, the hope, the listening to your heart, and following it wherever it chose to go. Happiness was always about being [kinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sD1UcJPPA&t=4676s) to yourself. It was always about embracing the person you were becoming. One day you will understand, that happiness was always about learning how to live with yourself, that your happiness was never in the hands of others. One day you'll realize that true happiness comes from within, and no external factors can define it. It was always about you.
