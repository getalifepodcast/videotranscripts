### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here today with Cheryl, Pam Danylchuk, and Carman. And we're going to talk more about what it was like to leave today.

My Aunt Pam is going to tell us what it was like to leave. And we're just going to have some open conversations about what happens too when you're outside the cult and a family member passes away. What does the church do? Do they allow you near? No, they don't. So let's find out about this. Cheryl?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=35s)

Hi. Yeah, so we have Pam here with us. And we're very, very grateful that you've joined us today, Pam.

Yeah, if you want to kind of just let us know a little bit about your story, like when you left, and what kind of provoked you to leave, or if you got kicked out, what was your situation like?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=55s)

Well, when I decided that I was going to leave, I was at a meeting in Neche, and Carman and I have talked about this. But Mr. Symington, or the MOG at that time, made a lot of fun about my dad, called him geeky and lanky and made fun of him wearing shorts riding his bike, because my dad, you know, rode around Bilford Drive. I don't know if he was going to see his grandkids or what, but kind of made fun of him a lot there and right in the meeting. And I thought at that time, I thought, you know, that that was it for me. I thought, I am, I am not going back. And it was sort of like the icing on the cake.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=105s)

So didn't our grandfather have a disease as well? So wasn't he being picked on for a medical condition?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=115s)

Yes, he actually had acromegaly, which is a tumor on the pituitary gland at the base of his skull. And he actually went to Montreal to have the surgery. But what that does is it makes all your joints and your feet and your hands, your ears, nose, and also his heart and his organs grow. Like his hands were like bear paws, they were huge. So he did look kind of different, right? Not to me because he was my dad and I saw him all the time and he was just the loving father that he always was but you know as he was getting bigger and bigger you know he did look different and uh Jim Symington just poked fun at him in this meeting and I remember talking to Carman about it and she said she was sitting with her grandma at the time, right Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=173s)

Yep, that's right, right yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=175s)

And she, I guess, uh what was your grandma's name?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=180s)

Uh, Beatrice, Trissy everybody called her, yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=183s)

And what did she say? You can fill that part in.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=186s)

Well, I would have been, I think I would have been about 10 years old, um, and I remember sitting there and anytime he did that, it was like the atmosphere in the whole room was like electric. You know, it just got hot and you could tell some people were bothered, some people were, some people fed off it obviously, um which is a really sad situation. But I just remember her, she always took notes of the meeting and I remember when he said that she put the lid back on her pen, stuck it back on her notebook and she said, "No, no, Jim, no."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=223s)

Wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=224s)

And it always stuck with me because they preach so, so much submission in there that women, I mean, I just grew up thinking that we weren't even supposed to to think. And I remember sitting there thinking, you know what, she actually thinks, like she gets it. This is not good.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=243s)

Just for the listeners, I want to paint this picture. So these are massive gatherings of church members, right? And the leader, Jim Symington, was considered like Bruce Hales. Now he was the top, top dog. Now you have my great-grandfather, sick with a disease that that causes his extremities to grow. And the leader of this Christian cult is making fun of him for his medical condition publicly in front of hundreds of people. How Christian. Wow. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=280s)

Yeah, and to paint the picture too, that would have been an interchange meeting. It would be four complete localities there. And I think when we all got together, it would have been somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 people. Would that be right?

I mean, the room was full and it felt really hot. And I mean, it was just wrong. I mean, even as a 10-year-old, I just remember feeling like, oh, I just want to get out of here. You know, I mean, it was awful.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=306s)

So uncomfortable and like you could hear a pin drop.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=309s)

Yeah. Yeah. And was anything ever said after the fact? Like, was it ever addressed? Was it brought up? Did anybody apologize for it?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=317s)

Never. Never.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=319s)

And how did your mother take that?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=322s)

Well, you know, I never talked to my mom about it until, um, years later. And I said to her, it was after I had been out for years and she, you know, it's when they all came back to try to get us to come, they came to visit to try to get us to come back to the church. Like that was about 15 years ago, when the review was happening.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=344s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=346s)

Yeah. And uh, I told this to my mom and she says, "Oh, I know." She said, "Dad was so upset." He just, um, but she says he just accepted it. That was, you know, that was what was given to him. And and I said, "But Mom, that's not right."

You know they were just so like, "the man of God" and, you know, "Mr. Symington, he knows best." And I just, like I said, "Well, I just," I said, "I couldn't live with that." I said, "That's wrong. It's not right."

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=376s)

How old were you when that happened?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=379s)

Um, I left when I was 23, 22, 23\. Okay, yeah. So that's like 40, I'm 66, so 43 years ago.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=395s)

Wow. And so what led up to you wanting to to leave? And and what, like, kind of pushed you across that line? Like, that's too much, I'm done.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=404s)

It was that meeting and I just, I went home and then I started, you know, when we have an interchange, I'd say, "I don't feel good. I'm not going to go." And I just started kind of backing away from that. And then, um, that's, that's how I did it. I went out with a bunch of friends that I knew from work and, um, I got in major trouble for it and was accused of a whole bunch of things that I didn't do and I was "shut up" as they call it. And they left me for over nine months without coming to visit me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=443s)

Wow.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=444s)

Like the priests. So I was like nine months living in my parents' home, you know, probably couldn't eat with them.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=453s)

Couldn't eat with them, right?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=453s)

No, couldn't eat with them, couldn't, you know, could hardly talk to them. I was going to work and stuff. I had to tell them everywhere I was going, if I was going shopping after work or anything. So that was fine. I had nothing to hide. And all that time, I really wanted to get back in. I don't know why, but I guess, you know, I guess I got, you know, you get scared. Yeah, you're scared. So, yeah, so they left me for nine months. And I started thinking, this is ridiculous. And I said to my mom and dad, I said, "Look, you're sitting in the kitchen eating dinner, and I'm sitting in the living room." I says, "I don't care what they say, I'm coming and eating with you." And I just walked in there, sat down, and yeah, my dad just had this smile on his face. You know, Lane, how he had that great smile. I said, "I don't care. I'm eating with you. Stupid, right?" So, so then, um, yeah, so then they, um, the priests that visited me were, oh, they were disgusting. I was young, I was naive.

I, the questions they asked me, they just wanted me to, to admit that I had had sex or fornication or whatever they want to call it. And I just, nope, didn't happen. So, but you know, these two men are just like, wanting all this. It was, it was disgusting. And you know, I look back on it now and think that is, that's like, that's abuse.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=543s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=544s)

It is.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=545s)

100%.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=546s)

You know, like it was disgusting what they were trying to make me commit or admit to. And then at the same time, well, I heard after that one of them was having an affair with his secretary at work.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=565s)

Oh, for Christ's sake.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=567s)

Wow.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=568s)

Yeah. And I'm going like, "What? You're kidding me," you know. But it was...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=571s)

Sorry, go ahead.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=573s)

These priestly visits, you know, just so the listeners know, like, they really are disgusting, especially when you're a young person and you have someone asking you disgusting questions. I remember one time the priests asking me, because I got caught making out with this girl, and I was 17 at the time, and the priest asked me, "Who undressed who first? Where did you touch her?" That's disgusting. He was a perv.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=601s)

They are per- they are pervs. They really are.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=606s)

Yeah. So you, um, you left. So, so you get confined. Now, um, the review comes, they try and come and get you back, which is, blows my mind after everything they did to you. Um, can you also tell us the story you mentioned briefly on the phone about, um, your daughter and about how when she was born?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=632s)

Yeah, so I had, I got kicked out. That was fine.

You know, we started making a new life. And just to kind of go back to that, I worked at a doctor's office and my mom would always walk down the street because it was close to our house. My mom would always walk down the street to see me to see if she could see me when I'm coming out for lunch to go for lunch. And you know, she's standing across the street and it's heartbreaking and I've got to go back to work and try to function properly, you know, and do my job. And it was lucky I worked for a great uh, clinic. Dr. Ross was, uh, my boss and, and he knew all about the Brethren. He actually diagnosed my dad before, before anyone else had only by seeing him. My dad used to come pick me up from work to make sure I wasn't drinking or something, you know, or having a party at work.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=689s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=689s)

But, uh, he said, he told me after, he says, "I knew your dad had that acromegaly." So it was kind of interesting. But yeah, Dr. Ross was really good to me, him and his wife and, and uh, made me realize that there are, there, there are a lot more Christians in the world than the Brethren like you to believe, right? Yeah. So he was really good. They were great helping me. And then I, you know, I, I married Bruce. I'd grown up with him throughout the years, like when we were like 10 years old, we were neighbors. So we ended up getting married, had kids, and I was in the hospital. And, and I just had Olivia. And, um, anyways, I was laying there and I guess my back was kind of to the door and I was rocking her and I heard this noise and I kind of turned around and, and there was no one there. I thought it was a nurse coming in. So it was a little, a little bit later, the nurse came in and said to me, "Oh, did you enjoy your visit with your mom?" I said, "Oh, my mom wasn't here." I said, "My mom wasn't here." She's, "Oh, yes, yes, she was." And you know, I was so tired, just had this baby. And I wasn't thinking about my mom being there, right. And when they came back, like 20 years later, you notice to see if we would go back to the church. She told me she says, "You know, I always felt really bad. I came to see you in the hospital." I said,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=778s)

"Was that you?" Oh, that's heart-wrenching.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=785s)

She said, "I was too afraid. I was just too afraid." I guess there was another Brethren in the church, in the hospital at the time that she'd gone to see her and then never came in. It's not sad, like?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=799s)

Think of the reality of what we just, what you just said. Like, you had, was this your first child? Yeah. Your first child and your mom is too afraid to come and see you. Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=811s)

And can you, and I know you're a grandmother now, can you imagine not going and seeing your grandchildren? Like how could you do that? How could you choose fear over love?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=823s)

Yeah. I know when Madeline, my son's, youngest son's first daughter was born, I stayed there all night.

We were, you know, could have almost been in the delivery room. I was not, I was not leaving. I couldn't imagine, I couldn't imagine turning against my kids and my grandkids. I just, they're my, they're my life. They're just so special. How do you do that? I honestly don't know how they could do it and believe that that is right.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=854s)

It must break their hearts as well. And it's so unnatural that it blows my mind. And tell us too, my great-grandma, when your mother passed away, how callous they were.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=871s)

Yeah. Yeah. When my mom passed away, um, my son had had surgery and I, I really wanted to go down and see her in, where was she? In Baltimore or something or Washington?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=884s)

Washington D.C.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=885s)

Yeah, yeah. So I really wanted to go and see her, but my son had just had surgery and I thought, I can't, I just can't leave, right? I kind of had to look after him even though he was an adult, but still needed to be looked after. But anyways, then when she passed away, they, they did call me. David called, like your, your grandpa, Lane. Um, I always get mixed up. I think I guess I forget Lane is my great-nephew, right? Yes. Like his, his dad is my nephew. I always think it's his grandpa again. But anyways, uh, yeah, they did call me and um, that tell me, but they bury them the very next day, so nobody has time to go.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=929s)

Nope, they do that. They do that on purpose. Um, you know, I, I heard another case in, uh, in Toronto not that long ago where, um, the father died and he had two sons out and they lied about the time of the funeral so that they couldn't get there. Like, they just, it's just disgusting. They won't come in to see their grandchildren. They don't allow them to come to, members to come to their own family's funeral. And yet they call themselves a mainstream Christian church. You know, "and we don't break up families." Really? Every one of us on this podcast today has had our families ripped apart.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=971s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=974s)

But we're stronger for it, right? Like, I want to make sure that even listeners realize that like, and especially ex-members, right? Like every one of us did something that the rest of our families didn't have the strength to do. Yeah. And they're stuck in that fear, right?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=988s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=989s)

Oh man, that's, that's incredible. So no invitation to the funeral.

Any kind words? Do they contact you at all still?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1003s)

No.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1004s)

Nothing?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1005s)

No. Sometimes I'll send my sister Betty and my sister Margaret, I'll always send them an email on their birthdays. And I always get a reply.

You know, "Thank you. And how are you doing?" And that's, that's about it. Okay. I used to phone them, but you know, sometimes you just don't, I hate the, I hate the thought of being rejected all the time.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1032s)

Yeah. Yes, it's just...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1034s)

So hard to. And you know, it's easier not to do it, then you don't have to worry about it, right?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1039s)

Exactly. They, and have you noticed that even when you can speak to them briefly here and there, they absolutely give zero information?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1049s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1050s)

When I was speaking to my father, uh, one of the few times in the last 10 years, I think I've only spoken to him twice on the phone. And one time I was asking him and I said, "So how are you guys doing?" It was during the pandemic. And he said, "Okay, Lane, thanks, we gotta go, bye." Right? They won't give you any information on how they're doing. And it's like, oh, you sad, sad people.

But, um, let's go on to some, some news, some stuff that's, that's recently happened in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. We have some amazing news. Scott Hales has left the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church with another, uh, um, uh, female from the church. We don't know who yet. We're going to try and confirm who this is. But I think this is amazing to have a Hales leave. I mean, now, uh, they're gonna know what it's like.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1108s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1109s)

That's amazing.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1112s)

Amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1112s)

You know, sometimes that's how they learn, right, is to have one of their own leave. You know, it was when Morris Hope had, uh, who was one of my main priestly visit, the cancer of Maple Creek, when I had heard that one of his sons had left, I was, I, I was like, you know what? He needed to be able to experience what my family went through and what other families go through. That's how they learn.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1140s)

I've tried being nothing but loving to my family. I mean, for 14 years, I've tried to communicate with them with letters, e-mails, phone calls, happy birthdays, even birthday gifts, you know.

And then all of a sudden, you know, going through therapy and talking to my therapist, all of a sudden it's like, "Why, though?" right? Why am I focusing on this family that's rejected me when I can focus on the family that I do have? Right? Like my Auntie Pam and my girlfriend and all the people around me that are, that are real family, right? And so then I, I kind of all of a sudden started looking at that like family isn't everything, especially not blood family, right? It's who you make it and who actually shows loving kindness. And that isn't always family, or not immediate family anyway, you know.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1196s)

Yeah, sometimes friends are more, more family than family, right? Exactly. Exactly. They care about you and they, you know, they don't, they certainly don't do the things that our families did to us. No, totally rejecting us.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1213s)

And I think though that when you really dissect it, the Plymouth Brethren are acting out of fear, right? Fear is at the basis of a lot of hatred. I mean, I even go so far as to say that Hitler was terrified of the Jews. That's why he hated them, because he was scared that they would change his way of what he thought life should be like. So Bruce Hales, I'm not comparing them to Hitler. But what I'm saying is that they, how do I word this?

They're so terrified of the world that they decide to hate it, right? They're terrified that the world is evil and that these people in the world are evil. And we leave. And what do we find? That there are loving, compassionate, more caring people in the world than there are in the Brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1268s)

Although I don't think Bruce Hales believes that. I don't think Bruce Hales is afraid of the outside world. No, maybe not him. He just makes his believers believe that. Because I mean, it for, he has too much to do in the business world to be afraid of the world. I believe he just feeds that fear down the line to keep people in line, right? Like I, I, yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1294s)

I'll agree with you, but then I would say that he is still scared of something. And I would say that that is exposure and us. He is scared of what we have to say, because these stories are true and they're painful. And we're going to keep talking about them because the more we expose, hopefully at least one person maybe will, will choose to leave or be like, "You know what? I know that this person did, committed a crime and I'm going to tell the police," right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1324s)

I think there's, I think there's a, um, there's a point there too. I think that's why they keep women so quiet and they, you know, step on them and they spend so much time preaching submission is because they're scared. They don't want to hear a woman's point of view.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1342s)

The majority of victims in Plymouth Brethren would probably be women.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1346s)

Yeah. Well, I was just going to say they're afraid of women because I think we're, well, not for you, Lane, but I think we're smarter than them.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1357s)

You are. No, you are. You guys definitely are.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1361s)

Society. Yeah. Society has that.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1365s)

Yeah. Yeah. Women have the compassion and the caring along with the fire.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1371s)

Fire. How many, how many cults do you see run by women?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1376s)

Yeah, never. It's true.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1378s)

Yeah, right. Was it, I'm probably, it was even worse back, you know, when you were going through it too, their hatred of women.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1389s)

Oh yeah. Like you, you cooked and cleaned and had babies and, you know, you had, you had no say. You did what they were told and that was, oh, I couldn't imagine that.

I couldn't imagine living in that now.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1404s)

It's like being stifled, you know, like every woman in there has a gag on.

And it's awful. It's awful. They make them even now when they do their Zoom church meetings, right? So they do them by Zoom, even in the living room where they have the camera and they have to sit in front of their big TV and everyone can see everyone. The men have to sit in front of the women.

How misogynistic is that?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1434s)

Yeah, so they have TVs now? Yeah, they do. Yeah, for specific reasons, though, right? Like, yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1444s)

Yeah. So the rumor is that some watch Netflix, some don't. Most watch documentaries. Every, all their internet though is monitored, um, through Streamline, through Streamline 3\. So, so everything that, they can have music now, but they have their own music app called Trove, and it's absolutely atrocious. And it's all Plymouth Brethren music. So if you want to stab your ears with a fork, I mean, you could try it, but it's absolutely terrible. They're making up their own music apps. They're making up their own grocery stores. And it's what a joke. What a fucking joke.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1483s)

Think though that, so I mean, Bruce is smart with how he's done this because he's taken what is out in the world, right, and he's tried to give them duplicates of it, Brethren-wise, so that you know, you can kind of keep, I was, we were on James DiFiore's podcast yesterday and I said it's like he, he built them a candy store filled with all this candy and then he locked the door and the kids, people don't realize that they're inside this candy shop and locked in it, right? Like he's given them everything that our generations never, we never had, right? And now this generation, they have it and they kind of have like, when, when I was being told, "Oh, you know, you should come back, Cheryl, it's very different. It's completely different. It's completely changed." I was like, "But, but it hasn't changed." You know what I mean? Like it's just, the candy changed.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1533s)

The candy...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1534s)

You can, you just handed out candy, but nothing has changed. You're now just being kept quiet so that they can run what they need to run over top of it. And so that when you come out with the stuff that we're coming out with, the people inside, they're like, "Yeah, this is not true. It's just lies. It says this isn't real. This isn't true." Because they don't see it. They're busy sucking on their candies, and all this freedom that they think that they have. And it's not true freedom. One of the things, Pam, I wanted to ask you is because I know you have children, what is one of the biggest things that you made sure to change, or to really reiterate in your children growing up that you never got? Like what was, what was a big pivotal thing that that you made sure your children knew growing up?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1579s)

I think that I would always be there for them. I was never gonna ditch them. And, and you know, I think that would be the main thing. You know, you stand by them, you help them. You know, we've, we have three kids, we had normal life problems, great things, bad things, right? And, um, I just always wanted to stand by my kids and tell them they were loved, they would always be loved, and we'd help them through, through stuff. And I'm not going to leave them. I'm not going to desert them. Yeah, because they did something that I didn't like, right? And they sure have done that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1623s)

And would you say, Carman, too, like that is one of the biggest things us mothers really took out of us? I mean, you have, what, seven children, right? Yeah. I think, do you think that that's one of the biggest things that we've taken away from our grief of what we went through?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1640s)

And I think, too, when you think of day-to-day life, I let my kids, if they wanted to do something, we would let them talk about it, bring it up. Um, nothing was a hard no. So if they wanted to do something they knew we probably wouldn't like it, we would at least, there was always open conversation about everything. So we would say our point of why we would rather if they didn't do it and they would say why they wanted to do it and then everything is open for discussion. And I think inside there as a kid growing up, there's certain things that you didn't even talk about because you just knew that would just like pop a fire cap. And I think that's one of the things I changed.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1686s)

And do you find you both do it for your grandchildren too? Like it's even reiterated more within the grandchildren? No, for sure.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1693s)

Yeah. Yeah, they get away with everything. I know. And...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1701s)

I'm like, "Oh yes, of course." Yeah, "Can you do this?" "You betcha I can do that."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1711s)

Yes, you can. And I'll even help you and I might even buy it for you too.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1719s)

My granddaughter, Madeline, she's four, and she really hates going to preschool, right? And so one day Monica asked me, she said, "Can you come over? I just, Carrington's sick and I can't get Madeline to school." And we live really close. So I said, "Oh, sure, I'll come and take her to school." So I get there and it was like, I said, "Madeline, do you want to just come to grandma's house?"

Yep, yep, guilty. Yeah, so I had asked Monica before. I said, "Do you mind if I, should I just take her home for a little while?" And maybe, you know, anyway. So I, like our, Monica came and picked her up at lunchtime and took her to school, but she, she's gonna be grabbing us for a while and calm down. Yeah, that's cool. Thinking, you know, what's the big deal? Right? She's four years old. She's not gonna, she's not gonna miss out on really anything if she doesn't go to school one day and comes to grandma's house. She was so perfect that...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1782s)

And he's always perfect though. Pam, did your children growing up, like, did they ever question, like how did you explain to them about your parents and where they were and why they were absent in their life?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1797s)

I did explain it to them. And yeah, I told them it was their, you know, it was the church and that we, you know, they have their beliefs and they just kind of accepted it. It was almost like they grew up without them. So they didn't really, you know, question a lot. And then one day we were shopping at Polo Park and I saw my mom and dad and I walked by and I thought, "No, I am going back." So I turned around, went back and I said hi to my mom and dad, they were sitting in the, in the middle of the mall, right. And so, and they were sweet, like they talked to me and, "You know, we're praying for you, Pamela," and I get it. So anyways, after that, the kids were always saying, "Let's go to Polo Park and see your, see your, see grandma and grandpa." They thought they lived at Polo Park.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1847s)

And see, like that's...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1849s)

It's so heart-wrenching.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1850s)

It is heart-wrenching.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1852s)

And I think that's the biggest thing. Like in, in, for, for my, like I have three children, it was my daughter who had the hardest time with it, seeing her friends had grandparents and, um, people around us that had grandparents, right? And I think that was the hardest thing for her to ever digest is she just wanted grandparents so bad. And it's just, I think that's, I mean, I think there's always a part of grief that we have, and we're always biting it off and chewing it because there is, there's a lot of grief there for the situations and being separated. But I think that's the biggest piece of grief that I always have to chew off in small chunks and process is that my children never got to experience that close connection of grandparents. And I think grandparents are such an important part of your life. They're just so important. Um, it is one of those things.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1907s)

So much freedom. You know what I mean? Like it's a sacrifice for sure. There's sacrifices, right? But those choices weren't, aren't easy, especially like mothers. I can't imagine, you know. But at the same time, what you've done for your children is so immense. Like you literally gave them a completely new life that no one before you, you know what I mean? Your siblings and everything didn't have, and they couldn't, they didn't have the strength to do it. So it's pretty amazing what each one of you has done for your children. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1946s)

Yeah. So this is a good question that we like to ask people. So what do you think is the biggest error in the PBCC doctrine, Pam?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1959s)

Hmm.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1962s)

I think, I think it's that they've closed their doors to everybody.

I said to my mom, I was talking to my mom one day and I said, "You know, mom, if you just would open your doors to the world, maybe you would convert all these sinners."

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1978s)

That's a great point.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1981s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1982s)

She couldn't get it. She, you know, like she was older too, probably in her 80s at that time. But I said, "If, if everyone is so bad, yeah, why don't you open the doors and, and let, preach them the gospel so they would, maybe you would convert them all?"

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=1999s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2001s)

It's hard that they don't see the hypocrisy, right? Yeah. Of, of the Christian world that they live in and yet it's, it's so hypocritical of their beliefs, right? It's just, everything is just, they just don't see the hypocrisy that they're living under.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2019s)

They see themselves as different, right? But what you've got to break it down to these people, and I hope there's some Brethren members listening, is you need to understand, if you're a Brethren member right now, that if you are put into a room with another human being that does not speak your language, that's a different race, a different culture and everything.

If you're handed food, you'll both know what to do with it. If you're handed a mattress, you'll both know what to do. Handed water, you'll both know what to do. So that means that for life, those two people in this imaginary thought game didn't need their fucking religion, excuse me, but didn't need it to survive. So my personal, again, it's just my personal opinion of the worst doctrine of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church would be the fact of Christianity altogether. Now, again, that's just my opinion. Personally, if there is a creator, I do not think that the creator has a favorite type of elephant. I don't think he has a favorite type of zebra. So I don't think that anything a human can do can be unhuman. So the universe, as far as they've measured, is infinite. So if there's infinite planets, stars, and possibilities. The idea that the creator has one favorite planet, and one special type of human sapiens, homo sapiens, right? It just doesn't make, that logic just doesn't add up for me. Why would you have a favorite?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2118s)

And most, I mean, you get into the most hardcore religious sects, right? Jehovah's Witnesses, and, and I mean, even Mormons, right? Like you get into this thing where everybody thinks they all have their own special place because of what they believe underneath their roof. Right. And I do. And I agree that that is probably the biggest downfall of these Christian religions is they get lost in how they interpret everything. Right.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2143s)

Yeah. They all think they're special. They all think that they have something. Right. The Mormons have the Book of Mormon. The Plymouth Brethren have the Bruce Hales's ministry. Right. The Seventh-day Adventists have their own thing. Jehovah's Witnesses have their book of Jehovah or wherever. They all have their secret little thing that is going to get them into this amazing super VIP special spot. Right? There is no VIP section.

Anyway, that's my rant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2172s)

No, and it's valid. It's very valid. Yeah. That's truly.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2176s)

I just feel like if there is a creator there that something that could make something so magnificent as the mountains, waterfalls, you just take 10 minutes and look at grass and watch insects and you're like, this is, this is incredible. This is absolutely beautiful. It's amazing. And there's definitely, I'm just a little speck and I highly doubt that my actions are going to get me sent to an eternal torture chamber, right? Like, let's remember that that's the basis of what this Christian cult says, right? If you fuck up the rules, although you're born into this video game that they tell you, you have to follow this one book of rules. And if you fuck up, you're going to get tortured for eternity.

Tortured for eternity if you fuck up these rules. I didn't even want to play this game. Like...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2231s)

It's just ridiculous. Well, isn't this like, this is almost like what wars are all about, correct?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2238s)

100%. This is what happens. You get all these different beliefs and everybody thinks their belief is the best. And it's just like, I think over the last, this last weekend, I've just been in a tumultuous place of the fixer in me just wants to go and fix. I just want to find a way to fix this. And it's not, it's not easy, but I do believe that having people like you come on, Pam, and and and tell your story and kind of join in our conversation, it kind of spreads the word that, you know, let's go on, let's have these conversations, because I do think it starts with us owning our voice and knowing that we have a voice that makes us stand up and be like, "Hey, this isn't right." You know, like, like if you had a chance, Pam, to go back, walk into the church, and you were given a platform that Pam gets to say whatever she wants to say, and it's listened to and addressed, what would you, what would your message be to them? What would you say to them? I want to hear.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2300s)

You don't want to know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2301s)

I do want to know. And you know what, you give it to us straight because you know what, what you say allows other people to be like, "You know what, I was thinking that too. That's what I would like to say."

So yeah, we can take it.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2314s)

Oh, I know you can. It's everybody else.

Oh man, I, I would, I think I would just say, "You guys are so pathetic. You, you don't even know what real life is all about. Yeah. And you're all sitting there thinking you are so holy and mighty, high and mighty, and you're all a bunch of fucking idiots."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2337s)

Love it. Yes.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2338s)

Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right? It's like Get-A-Life. It's just like the podcast, Get-A-Life. Like come on. How can you see this? How can you, how can you stay in there and think that is right? And it's not just like you say, their doctrine, it's like their, like the way they're treating people and families and letting things go, Cheryl, like in your case, and Lane, and and many like, and they, that's okay. I want to shake them. I just want to shake them and say, "Come on\!"

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2373s)

What I would say to them, I'd ask them, I'd ask them this simple question, "Why are you guys not the happiest people in the world?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2380s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2381s)

You should be. You're the one true church. You should be happier than everybody. But they're not. They're miserable. And they come to you and, and you guys can all attest is when they talk to you after you leave at priestly visits, they're like, "Oh, just appeal to you. Please, we're praying for you." And they're just this miserable and you're like, "Uh, I gotta go." You know, like, "I'm going to a bar with my friends. I'm gonna go have some, I'm gonna play a video game." You know, "I'm gonna, I'm gonna eat sushi that you guys don't even know what it is." You know, "I'm gonna try Indian food." And you realize they're miserable. With all their money and everything they have, they can't enjoy it. They're miserable. So I would give them all the finger and I'd be like, "Y'all suck." What would you say, Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2438s)

Oh, no, I was just thinking, did you ever go to church after you left, Pam?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2442s)

I did try to go to church. Yeah. I went to a Baptist church and it was interesting because I, you know, my husband was not, there is no way he was coming. So I thought, go pick the kids. I think I just had, maybe I had all three of them at that time, I can't remember. But, um, so I go to this one service and I knew people there. So anyways, I take the baby, I think it was John, I take the baby into the service with me and he was like a newborn, so he was quiet, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2479s)

Yeah, just...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2480s)

Sleeping. And they came up and they said, "You know, there's a nursery for your baby." And I said, "Yeah, I know." And uh, so as I sat there, and the, the girl next sitting beside me, she, she just said, "You don't need to take the baby to the nursery." I said, "I'm not going to."

So anyways, they came up about four times and said, "Well, you have to take the baby to the nursery or, or you can't be here."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2503s)

Really? Oh my, wow.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2504s)

So I got up, I walked out and, uh, of course, they're all looking, looking, and then I think someone phoned me after and I said, "Well, if it's not good enough for my baby, then it's not good enough for me. I don't want to be a part of it." Yeah. So that was it. I, I kind of, I think I kind of got my little fix, you know, thinking, am I really missing something? Right? Am I missing something about me, even though I didn't want to go back to the church, but am I missing something? Should I do this for my kids? You know, should be a good Christian, you know, and I thought, no, I was, that was it for me and I never did go back.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2545s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2546s)

And I, and I don't want to, and I never will. I think, you know, being Christian, you have your own relationship with, with God. And that was it. That's how I feel and how I live my life.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2558s)

Yeah. So wow.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2560s)

But it was like, it was like, "Oh, again." I thought churches, they're all the same. They're all the same.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2568s)

They are. Like...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2570s)

As soon as, soon as you have to tell me how I can love someone else and, and rules that I gotta follow to, to express love.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2577s)

Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2580s)

Yeah. And you know, it's funny, I know we're not talking about, uh, the pandemic here, but, um, you know, when the government comes out and tells you you have to do something, yeah, I think that freaked me out and I says, "I am not doing it." And I honestly do relate it to the church for me. Yeah. I respect people that have, if you have or you don't or whatever, but when that came out, I think the hair on the back of my neck went up and I thought, that's it. I'm like, forget it. You're not telling me what to do. And I think it all came back to the church and I just kind of had like a little PTSD moment there and I thought, this is just like them telling you what you have to do. Yep. I'm not, I'm not doing that.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2627s)

So speaking, speaking of PTSD quick, too, um, that's something I wanted to mention is let's remember, first, let's take an example. So if you took people that left, let's say the Catholic Church, and if 90% of the people that gave up the Catholic faith had PTSD, would there not be a fucking problem? Like the vast majority of ex-members of the church have some form of PTSD.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2656s)

100%, yes.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2658s)

Sure. And it's the fact that we got it from this church, you know what I mean? Should speak volumes. I mean, if people are leaving an organization and getting post-traumatic stress disorder from being in there, that warrants a massive investigation.

But yeah, it's definitely, I, I can understand what you're saying about like getting triggered with getting told what to do. I, uh, I had a similar instance after one of the first podcasts I did, I had someone message me and tell me to connect them with someone else. And they didn't ask. They just, "You need to do this." And I just fucking lost it. I, I couldn't, I can't take that. Like you're not going to tell me what to do. Yeah. Unless you're, uh, you're in my chain of command and you're my boss.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2710s)

Yeah, yeah, I do think, I do think that's one of the gifts that we get though is this little bit of rebellion. But that rebellion makes you really listen to what's out there, right? It's not, we just don't go and just follow the, the flock, right? It's about you start, you, you create your own mind and you allow that mind to have its own, um, mechanism that says, "Hey, is this right for me or is this not right for me?" But the first thing that hits you though, is this, "I'm not doing it." Cause I'm the same way as if anybody tells me to go and do something, I have to do something. I'm like, "Yeah, no, I don't, I don't have to do that." 

Um, it was the same thing when they wanted me to do the police statement. I was like, "I'm not doing a fucking police statement. Just because you told me I have to do it. I'm not doing it." And I mean, I think it, I think it, it's good for us to slow down and have that rebellion in us to slow us down, to be like, hey, because we have to always, we're always reprogramming our brain because of what we went through, right? I think that piece of rebellion is a little bit of a break for us and it's good that we have it because it makes us just second guess and be like, "Hey, is this right? Does this, is this really what I want?" Um, and I think that's the biggest thing that's taken away in the cult, right? You, that is, you have no reason, no way of thinking. You don't, you don't not know how to think for yourself. When I left the church, the first thing I took up was drinking and smoking, right? It was the only way I knew how to relate to the outside world was vodka and orange juice in the morning. And I was able to go and meet the world because you don't have a way, right? And you get yourself in all these precarious situations because we don't know what to expect, right? 

And I do agree. I agree. Like one of the biggest things that they need to be held accountable for is the mental health of those that have left and also the people that are in there, but those that have left us, the mental health of every single one of us that have left. I mean, I'm hoping we can get everybody on here and everybody's going to say the same thing that, yeah, everybody does have a form of PTSD from being in there. Like, did you find, like, Pam, when you hear the stories of the generations that are leaving now, do you find much difference from the difference between when you left and these other generations that are leaving? Is there a difference that you find?

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2845s)

Well, I really haven't heard a lot about people leaving now, you know. I think the last one I really knew about was Lane. And how long ago was that, Lane? 14 years ago, you said?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2856s)

Yep, 14 years. And just so the listeners know, my Auntie Pam here helped me a tremendous amount leaving. Like, we, ah, we've had some great times together and definitely, like, it helped so much having someone, right? Having family that, that you know, that you can rely on, that's there. Like, because there are times, I know from, I speak for myself, but when you're just, you feel completely alone, right? Yeah. And sometimes for myself, you know, I was a bachelor for a long time and, um, holidays were always hard. Yeah, right? Sometimes being in the military, I couldn't always come or go somewhere for Christmas or I, um, I wouldn't know what to do for Thanksgiving. And I've had strangers and friends take me in and I've, you know, of course I've gone to my Auntie Pam's, but it's, it, it does suck sometimes when you're, you really, when you're alone. Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2920s)

Yeah, it does. It's, and it's nice to be able to have, like, for me, it was so great meeting you, Lane. And, and how it happened was my son John was in Montreal going to school, university, and Lane, of course, at that time lived there. And, uh, we met up and it was like...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2938s)

It was just so cool. You know, John had so much fun. He was a couple years older than me. And I was obviously still in the church. And I was, I must have been about 15, I think, or 16\.

I think I was about 15\. And I would sneak downtown on the train.

And I even played hooky from school sometimes. And I'd go and meet John because he was at McGill University. And I get to hang out with this university kids. And John would take me to frosh parties and...

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2971s)

I don't want to know everything.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2975s)

No, comparatively we were very good, but you know, I had so much fun. And I think part of that also sealed the deal for me. I was like, "Oh my goodness, this is, this is what life is like." Right? Like hanging out and going to parties and, and doing all this fun stuff that normal, you know, teenage boys and girls should be doing.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2997s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=2998s)

Um, that helped me immensely, you know.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3001s)

Yeah, me too. It was great to know that I just, I knew that if you needed help, I would be there for you. You know, and it's nice to have some family, right?

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3013s)

And it does, it's so heartwarming. Like I, I recently had a childhood friend leave. And me and this, this childhood friend were very close. And it just, it warms your heart because for, for 14 years, 15 years, I haven't heard a word, you know. And then all of a sudden you're like, "Oh, another one left." You know, it's so, so rewarding when you, when you hear about someone leaving, um, the cult.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3040s)

Yeah, I think what's amazing too is when we, when we all get talking to each other, it's like, it's like there was never a breakdown. I mean, we can all just pick up the conversation.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3053s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3054s)

It's like no time is...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3056s)

Left. Conversation helps. Talking about this stuff helps, right? These conversations, these podcasts help. We're getting our listeners really into our lives and the suffering that we went through, but also the strength that we have now, right? And we're showing those listeners, maybe there's some young people listening right now that are like, "Wow, these people made it. Why are they not angry? They're not angry. They're not sad. They're happy." You know, and that's what we're gonna show, right? That doesn't mean that life is just perfect and roses on the outside of the cult. No, it's reality and it's real and it's raw, but there's so much happiness. Yeah. The choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3097s)

Yeah, and that's the key is when you learn that you have choice, then all of a sudden your brain gets engaged and then all of a sudden you're like, "Well, who am I?" right? Who am I outside of everything that was put on me? And that's the most rewarding part of this is like every day being able to wake up and find a new piece of yourself that had been suffocated or covered up, right? Like it's, and I mean, 30 years of being out, I still am finding those pieces of myself. And it is, it's so rewarding to know that you have choice.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3129s)

Yeah. Um, before, uh, a wrap up, I always want to call out some names of some, some bad people. So I'm going to call out names of of three priests in Montreal that, uh, took my story of sexual abuse and then decided to do nothing with it. And they are Randy Cowie, Derek Cowie, and Johnny Fossey. So these three individuals, all, I told them all about how I was sexually abused, and they did nothing. They never spoke to me about it again. So that's why I just want to call out names of bad people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3166s)

Yeah, it's good to expose it. Yeah. You were gonna say something, Pam.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3173s)

I was going to say that if there's anyone in Winnipeg, especially in Winnipeg, because I live here, and you need someone to talk to or you need to come over or you need to talk, I'm here. I'm here for you. Like...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3188s)

I love that.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3189s)

I love that. Definitely be here. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3192s)

That's great. And I think that's important for them, everybody to know, right? Like just with the people that I've been communicating with is that, um, I had a good conversation yesterday with somebody that's in.

And it was such a message that I was trying to convey is that there's hundreds of people out here that would take anybody in in a heartbeat, right, and help them and be able to let you see the possibilities that you are outside.

Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure there's lots of them. Everybody's so related. What's, what I enjoy about these conversations is that we all have experienced the same thing. And so you can kind of sit in this little blanket of like, I don't have to explain what I'm feeling to any of you because I know you're already feeling it. You felt it. You've gone through everything that I've gone through, right? No matter what our stories is. And I think that's the biggest thing I'd like to express is that I always get people like, "Oh, well, my story wasn't like your story." And I'm like, "That's not the point."

It doesn't matter what your story is. We all end up in the same pool of trauma in there. We do. It doesn't matter what path took you there. I mean, somebody could have been just groped by an elder and done the exact same amount of emotional trauma than what I went through. But it doesn't, I think that's the biggest thing is that in there, you need to realize is that it's all of our stories take us to feeling the same way. And just don't compare each other's story. It's more about supporting each other in that same pool of trauma that we've all been through. And there's tons of people out here that are willing and ready, like Pam is saying in Winnipeg, ready to help you or listen to you, lend an ear. Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3299s)

Yeah, I was gonna say, Cheryl, when you, when you said that, because I, I thought that as well about you. I thought, "Oh man, like that your story is just like unbelievable." I cried, sat and cried when I listened to your podcast and shocked, totally shocked. And then I thought, you know, brought back the feelings of when I was sexually assaulted by someone that was in the church. He's no longer in the church. But I thought, well, it was nothing compared to what you went through. But then I heard you say that on a podcast. I thought, okay, you know, you're right. Because we all went, yeah, it was ignored, nothing was done about it. How did it affect me? I don't really know how it affected me, but it has affected me in ways that maybe I don't even think about right now.

But I am a fierce protector of my girls in my family. I have my daughter, two daughter-in-laws, two great-granddaughters, and also my little beautiful grandson. But I'm a fierce protector of them. Like I don't let my sons, I'm like, I don't let nothing happen to them because I think I just like, so protective because I thought, I can, I, I don't know what I would do if somebody did anything to them that would happen to me. And then it was, I know my, I love my mother, I know my mother saw it and I know my my oldest brother saw it and nothing was done, but you know...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3395s)

That's awful.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3396s)

It is hard. Yeah, it's...

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3399s)

Not comparable, right? Like you can't compare traumas because oh, but that trauma is trauma.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3405s)

Exactly. We all, it's like all the same grief. It's all the same shame. It's all the same guilt. It's all the same.

Shame is just huge. Oh, it's huge. And you know what? I have people, you know, okay, so I get things inside of like, "Oh, you know what, Cheryl, you know, watch your podcast." People inside are like, "It's just all lies." And you know, it's like, I don't even care that people don't believe my story because I'm the one that has to deal with opening up that can of worms inside me every day. So I don't give a shit if you don't believe me. I wish I didn't have to believe me. I wish I could have a break from it. I would love to have a fucking break from it for just 24 hours. And so it doesn't bother me when people say that they don't believe me because I completely understand. I get it. I get why you don't, why you don't want to. And that's okay. 

The thing is, is that the shame that comes with being, exposing sexual trauma and sexual abuse is horrific. It's so hard to get through. The only thing that I can say that has helped me battle shame is by understanding where that shame comes from, because shame comes from when the actual trauma itself has happened with the perpetrator. And in my case, Ellen was very, he just, I mean, everybody you talk to that has had incidents with Ellen, all have the same thing. He just owned you. He just had this feeling. He was just very bold with it. And when things didn't go right, or if you did something wrong, gosh, the, that the shame is just the, the shame that you feel from what happens inside that trauma engulfs you. It just engulfs you. I think the biggest problem that if I had a chance to say something to the Brethren would be their lack of sexual education. And I think one of the biggest problems inside there is the way that it is a taboo subject. It is not talked about.

Um, it's, these women are just submissive in this relationship. I think if they really wanted to tackle the pedophiles inside there and the sexual abuse that goes on inside there, they have to start teaching sexual education of some sort because I mean, I mean, we were hearing just, uh, Lane, yesterday on James DiFiore's podcast about the sexual castration that had just recently happened because of masturbation. I think if they don't honor the body's, um, natural, organic, physical response to through puberty and maturing and all that kind of stuff, this is what you end up with. You end up with a backlog of all of these people that are in behind the door sexually abusing submissive women because nobody's been taught how to handle their bodies. And it is one of the, I think it's one of the biggest, biggest issues they have in order to be able to kind of clean up this mess. But I mean, that's a huge task. How can you introduce to the PBCC, like, "Hey, you need to do sexual education. You need to allow these people to masturbate and so that they are leaving other people alone." I mean, I get Alan is a very sick man. I think he's not just your typical person who's, uh, wasn't able to masturbate and ended up, he, he's not like that. He is, you're a very complex case of pedophilia. Um, but for those, for those cases that if these young men are just taught how to honor their body, the women are giving some sort of guidance on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, instead of everything happening behind closed doors. I'm going to tell you something that somebody told me. I haven't, I haven't revealed this publicly and I'm not gonna, I know we gotta wrap this up soon, but I, I'm not going to give names. But I had someone come to me and say that they witnessed me or my sister being taken into a bathroom with young teenage boys at the time, young, young men, and coming out and bragging what they did. And this person didn't know if it was me or my sister. And like, that's how it fucking starts.

 And I'm like, it's just, ah, I guess when you, when you, when you, when we get into all the heat of this stuff, for me, I'm always looking at, it's not about, this isn't about gossip. This isn't about collecting people's stories to sit here and talk about it. This is about put the shit on the table and let's find out what can we do with this? Like, what is in our power to as collective, gathering enough people together, how can we change this? What kind of movement can we make that actually produces some sort of safety for those kids that are still inside there? And I said that to the police in one of my last letters. I said to him, like, "What can we do? What can I do? What can you do?" Like, let's, let's do something. I just can't sit here and get the stories I'm getting, getting the phone calls that I'm getting and sleep at night because I can't. Right? Like it's just, my heart is so broken right now, but broken not in a victim state, broken in the sense it's broken because there's so much compassion inside there that I just want to get in and I want to bubble wrap all these children.

And I just think that if, you know, I invite everybody to come forward and help us put our heads together on how to do this. So in the meantime, right now, I'm just, if we can kind of come, I want to kind of compile lists of MLAs and the government people that we can start sending emails and letters to and start expressing this kind of stuff. Because I was, I got a reply back from the police this morning and I mean, obviously they can't tell me what's going on. He said he's very much on top of things and in, in my case, um, he's hearing what I'm saying. I just think that we need to tackle this from another direction beside, besides the judicial and waiting for the police to to finish their investigation. I talked to Caitlin Erickson yesterday, who is part of, she's part of the Legacy Christian Academy situation that's happened there. She did her yesterday, she had done her police report 496 days ago, and there's still no charges. These things take such lengthy time that in my mind and in my heart, I don't have 496 days to wait to try and bring some awareness of what's happening inside there. I'm not going to wait 496 days. I just refuse. Here's someone telling me like, "You got to wait." I'm like, "No, I don't."

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3845s)

Well, that's why we're doing this podcast. Exactly. We're bringing this out and we're talking about this and we're going to bring on more people. We're going to have more stories, more in-depth conversations.

And we're going to bring these pedophiles to light.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3861s)

Yeah, so and I mean everybody who's listening, if you've got ideas of how we can shed more light on this situation, that's what we want to hear. We want to hear that.

You know, go ahead. I was just saying I welcome everybody to help me put together these lists of provincial MLAs across Canada.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3882s)

Perfect.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3883s)

I need help with that.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3886s)

I'd be more than happy to help you. Okay. Yeah.

You know, Cheryl, when you were talking about like a movement, and I was, when you said that, I thought, you know, what's happened in the last year about these children.

I just can't think of it right now. What is the name of it? Those children that were found dead in these graves at these schools, residential schools.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3910s)

Residential schools. Yeah.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3911s)

I thought, you know, this may be on a smaller case, but this is the same.

This is absolutely the same. It's just a different subject. It's just a different subject. But it's still like abuse, what those kids went through and everything. It's religious trauma.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3929s)

Religious trauma.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3931s)

And, you know, we definitely will get there. I do believe we'll get there doing these podcasts and different things, but we definitely need to get it out there. It's got to be big. Absolutely.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3944s)

Okay, guys.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3945s)

We look forward to our next guest. I know we have a bunch lined up here. Okay. Thank you so much, Pam.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3951s)

Thank you.

### [**Pam Danylchuk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3952s)

You're welcome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3953s)

Thank you.

### [**Lane**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoTBLzvfOWU&t=3954s)

Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
