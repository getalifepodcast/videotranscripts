## Summary

In the next 2 episodes, be prepared to hear history that sets up the toxic behavior we see escalated today, in the PBCC. Neville and Pip McCallum wrote a book called Cast outside the camp that documents the insidious horrors that the Exclusive Brethren are capable of. Neville walks us through their families' journey, escaping this awful cult. Through his humor and strength to face the cult head on, we sift through letters, postcards, and numerous accounts of how he stood up to them, including a response from BDH himself.
Did we have a moment in time that history could have been changed? Sitting through this podcast and enthralled at the history generations below  hadn't heard, Lindy and Cheryl start putting pieces together. What we see today with the PBCC has been building for years, and what Neville informs us of will leave you with your mouth hanging open and light bulbs going off.
What Neville and others started years ago is what the next generation is building off of, but this time with social media that can't be stopped! THINGS MUST CHANGE!
Every generation will do well to read their book, Cast outside the camp, and watch podcast part1 and part 2 to understand, from another perspective, how we got to where we are today.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom. This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

Coming up in today's podcast.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=59s)

And these young, we call them the sons of Zeruiah, these young rough men suddenly saw their chance to take over. That's why this happened.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=69s)

You mean John and Bruce, the brothers, John and Old Bruce Hales?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=74s)

Yeah, they saw the opportunity.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=75s)

You said they were young rough men.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=77s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=79s)

What do you mean they were rough?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=80s)

Well, the way they talked to the brethren was absolutely evil. Wow. Virtually swearing at the brethren, ordering them out of the halls. I was in the meeting when their other underdogs, Athol Greene and whatnot, were doing the same thing. Well, you know how JTJr. talked in the meetings in Aberdeen? Well, the Hales's were worse.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=105s)

I was shocked a few years ago to come across a repentance letter penned by John Hales, which we can probably put in the notes because it's publicly available on a website that is run by somebody called the Noakes Brethren, who I believe are in the Jamaica region, and they had a split with the Hales's.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=126s)

It took me 20 years to find out why we were withdrawn from, and I had to get it from somebody from Dargaville. I mean, it's just mind-boggling stuff. They get away with it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=138s)

And they're doing the same tricks today. That's what's fascinating, right, Cheryl? It's like he's saying this stuff from 40, 50 years ago and it's like, oh my gosh, these are the same playbook that they're operating by now. They, you can't find out what you got withdrawn from. They won't tell you.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=153s)

And another place, JND says if you call yourself the church at the expense of other people, it is the worst sin on the face of the earth. And I hope people listening who are inside are listening to what I'm saying, because that's JND word for word.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=171s)

Yeah, they don't want them reading JND anymore.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=175s)

No, they have adulterated that verse in 2 Timothy 2 now, taking the brackets out. Yeah. And Revelation says, you do that, you alter the text of this book, and I will add plagues to you. And that's exactly one of the red lines that the brethren have crossed. Yeah. It would please him. The focus is not on Christ to go to the breaking of bread, it's on Bruce Hales. Yeah, that's a serious red line to cross, and I wondered when that would ever [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=205s) crossed.

I know of one instance where a young person prayed and worshiped Bruce Hales, and somebody complained about it. And guess who got dealt with? The person who complained. The other thing about the Taylor family, some people say, "Well, who do you think is the most responsible person for where the Exclusive Brethren are today?" I cannot get past JT the Third. I spoke to JT the [Third's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=236s) sister-in-law, and she told me that when it erupted over Aberdeen and they had to decide whether Taylor was a pure man or a corrupt man, the person that was to sort it was JT the Third. I mean, why would you put a family member into a decision that's going to alter the course for 45,000 people?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=265s)

Welcome back, everyone, to Get A Life podcast, X-Cult Conversations. Today, I have Lindy joining our panel, and we have a very, very special guest, Neville, all the way from New Zealand. Welcome, Neville. Welcome, Lindy.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=278s)

Welcome. Hi, welcome.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=280s)

I am really excited for this podcast. Neville actually reached out to us at the very beginning of this whole journey, and his poor email got lost in the whole jumble of everything. And then I was asked to reach out to him again, and when he sent me all his stuff, man oh man, we have a jam-packed podcast for you today with everything that you can think of. So Neville, I'm going to hand it right over to you to start off with, because there's so much to cover. So yeah, take it [away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=310s), introduce yourself and start from the top.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=314s)

Yeah, well, as Cheryl said, I'm Neville, I think that's correct, from Blenheim, New Zealand. And I'll run through just a little bit of practical history and hope it's not too boring. It's a pity you've got to look at a frizzled up old fossil like me. I didn't want to be boring as well, so I'll try and keep it interesting. But my family came out from Scotland in 1854, settled here in Blenheim, where [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=344s) still am, obviously, into farming and logging, etc.

They were Presbyterians when they came out. And then later, around 1870, they joined the Exclusive Brethren with 12 children.

In 1933, my parents married and my mother came in from outside. All her family were either Anglican, Methodist, or Presbyterian and attended church regularly. So that's where my mother came from and joined up into the Exclusive Brethren.

In 1953, I met with my father, I met Stanley McCallum in the neighboring town to Blenheim and Nelson, and I can clearly remember Stanley. I was 10 at that time, and I can remember him talking about walking down the Mowbray Road, just the way he used to say it. In 1954, I became a believer, gave my life to the Lord, and broke bread [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=416s) that point, and we had very, very good times until 1959\.

And I won't go into that right now. Times were very good, no complaints. We were cared for well, teachings were good, everybody helped everybody, whether you were rich and poor, it worked really well. And then JTJr. came and had a meal in our home, and I can remember that very clearly. Dad asked him if he'd like a drink and he said yes, he would. And Dad gave him a black stout and raspberry, which he probably never heard of before, and he said he liked it very much and came back for a second helping. So I can clearly remember that.

And then '59, of course, was that day that wrecked everything. And as we'll discuss a bit later, 1959, with the radical separation, completely tore the heart and soul out of the Brethren assembly because the Exclusive Brethren assembly was based on being evangelical. And so we'll touch that a bit later, but that [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=493s) really upset everything. No more worldly visitors. It created what I call a room of fire, and that they could withdraw from you and you'd lose spouse, family, or whatever if you don't agree with the dictators.

So that room of fire hit on '59. I can remember the day that it actually happened because they took the notice board down on the end of the hall, which had the [words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=523s) on it regarding the glad tidings, "All are welcome," and they threw it in the urinal. They threw it in the toilet. Wow. And for years, I remember going to the toilet and looking down at that board. And I know the piece of wood is worth nothing, but to reject the words that were on it completely debased the Exclusive Brethren.

So there was no need for the gospel. I used to ask friends along, could never do that anymore.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=554s)

What approximate age were you then, sorry, Neville?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=557s)

I was 15\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnhvYU5qgp2M%26t%3D558s)

Great, you were 15\. So yeah, you were your mid-teens.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=562s)

Yes, yep. Very, very remember it because of the effect it had on my family. They were evangelical, and of course all mum's family, four siblings and all their children, all my first cousins, they were all gone. We couldn't have any more to do with them. And it was a, I remember that being a very dark day in our home. After that, we were [fruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=593s) growing people. We grew apples, peaches, pears, whatever. We developed the business further, went into tree topping in a 60-foot boom, and we did that for 20 years.

In '64, 1964, Bruce Hales, Old Bruce, came to New Zealand for the much infamous Motueka three-day meetings. And he came and he [took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=623s) on an issue in Blenheim that had raged on for 20 years with sisters even fighting with their handbags. That's how bad it got.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=630s)

Oh, wow.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=631s)

My mother was attacked with a handbag. Bruce Hales came out and in a matter of two or three hours, he turned everything upside down in this 20-year program that even JTJr. had got involved in. And he sorted the whole thing out in a matter of a few hours at around two o'clock in the morning in Motueka. An amazing thing he did. We could talk about it later, but...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=657s)

So this is John Hales's brother? He's known by his initials, W.B.H., is that right?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=664s)

Correct, correct.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=665s)

So he was actually William or something, but he was called Bruce. That's who you're referring to.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=670s)

Yeah, that, we call him Old Bruce, just to differentiate from young Bruce.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=675s)

Okay. So are you saying he did a good job sorting it out?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=680s)

Yes. I'll have to be totally impartial. He did what Blenheim couldn't handle, what Australia couldn't handle, what JTJr. couldn't handle. This massive matter was settled in one...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=693s)

Was it just conflict? Like, you don't need to go into the detail, but just to wrap my head around it, was it just interpersonal conflict or like conflict between, like, was it religious at all or was it just, yeah, personal conflict between leaders?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=706s)

Yes, I can cover it now if you want me. I'm in your hands, so you just tell me.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=709s)

Oh yeah, you know, just a quick, just a quick, you know, sentence or two. I'm just curious about it.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=714s)

It was a doctrine over separation, where my father had seen another brother handle a woman wrongly. And then another sister saw the same brother handle the sister wrongly. Now that's two witnesses. Not two witnesses of the same time event, but two witnesses of the same error. And my father and Jeff Beatson, who was the grandfather of the young Beatsons here now, he agreed with my father and said, "That's two witnesses. We need to deal with this sexual corruption."

The brethren said no, because two people never saw the same event at the same time. And that took 20 years to solve. It divided the brethren right down the middle. Hales came in and he was in a meeting in Motueka after the meetings, and all the head charangas from New Zealand were there. There was about 20 of them in the room. And he says, "Righto, we're going to sort out the Blenheim matter. Do you think it [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=791s) stand or fall?"

And he went around the whole room until he got to the last person, and they all said it will fall. In other words, the witness that my father and a sister had said was witness was not going to be accepted. He got to the last brother, which was Spence Knowles, who was the father-in-law of Lionel Larsen in Christchurch, and he said, "It can't, it'll, it [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=821s) won't stand, it'll fall." And Bruce Hales said, "Why not?" And he said, "Because it's got nothing to stand on." And Bruce said, "Well, how do you know?" He said, "Well, Jeff Beatson, husband of the sister who was a witness, has recorded everything in writing from day one right to, it's all there."

And he was at the meetings in Motueka, the old man Beatson was. So Bruce Hales said, "Tell him to drive to Blenheim, which is two hours, get his file, and [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=851s) back here. And none of you are going to leave Raymond Smith's house until he returned." So they all sat there for four hours till he drove back to Blenheim, went back. Bruce Hales sat there, read all the notes for another hour in front of all those brethren at two in the morning, and he said, "I agree with your session. This matter is not going to stand." And he just blew it right there and then. That was the end of it.

And Frank Heaney came to the ministry meeting in Blenheim to see the whole 20-year thing overturned, and there were only two people that didn't have to get up and confess to anything wrong, and that was Jeff Beatson and my father. And he gathered a lot of fame. Sorry.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=902s)

Oh, they didn't have to confess because they were in a group, like Old Bruce was sort of agreeing with their call that they had stood by?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=914s)

Yes, well, the culprit, the sexual offender, would not say sorry, and he was still at large in the meeting, and that's what divided the brethren. So when Bruce Hales said, "Well," and he'd gone to Australia to live, but he came back to Blenheim and told Hales one or two others to be at the ministry meeting in Blenheim because he was going to roll Jeff Beatson and he was going to roll my father over this witness issue. So Frank Heaney [came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=945s) to Blenheim, I remember I was at the meeting, and instead of watching the whole thing stand and my father get withdrawn from, the Beatson get withdrawn from, it went the other way, and all the other way meeting then had to confess.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=959s)

So I guess in summary, I mean, it's clear that that's all that stuff stands out hugely in your memory, and at the time, I have no doubt it would have been incredibly tumultuous for everyone. Whereas now, whatever this is, like 40 years later or more, looking back, it just, I don't know, it just sounds like classic brethren, like infighting over authority and power dynamics and stuff.

But I'm curious that W.B.H. clearly had such authority or an ability to command respect that, because he wasn't the elect vessel, right? And he would have been only in his 30s.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1009s)

Yes, he would have been.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1010s)

Quite young. And yet you're saying he managed to come over and just like sweep the house and have authority and command people to repent. And like, yeah, I'm just curious about that because I guess we haven't, my generation hasn't heard much about W.B.H. And yet for him to like just rock into another locality and just like shake it up and dust it out, he clearly had quite a bit of authority.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1036s)

Well, the problem was, you've got to go back a little bit further than that. JTJr. at this stage in '65 was being dried out in hospital with alcoholic poisoning. Yeah. And these young, we call them the sons of Zeruiah, these young rough men suddenly saw their chance to take over. That's why this happened.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1058s)

You mean John and Bruce, the brothers, John and Old Bruce Hales?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1063s)

Yeah, they saw the opportunity. The way they talked to the brethren was absolutely evil. Wow. Virtually swearing at the brethren, ordering them out of the halls. I was in the meeting when their other underdogs, Athol Greene and whatnot, were doing the same thing. Well, you know how JTJr. talked in the meetings in Aberdeen? Well, the Hales's were worse.

And the cruel way they handled brethren, ordering [somebody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1099s) out of the meeting because he hadn't bought his wife a new dishwasher when she wanted it, and just got rid of the guy in front of everybody. I mean, the language and the arrogance was so bad, some of the old people in Motueka were actually dragged out of the meeting. These are brethren who were upset by it, were dragged out of the meeting and put in their cars and taken home because they couldn't sit there any longer and hear what happened in the Motueka meetings and in the Blenheim meetings as well. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1130s) was just so rough, you wouldn't believe it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1132s)

So, again, this stuff is obviously, I'm the younger generation, so what I've gathered about these things has been pieced together from the past. But I was shocked a few years ago to come across a repentance letter penned by John Hales, which we can probably put it in the notes because it's publicly available on a website that is run by somebody called the Noakes Brethren, who I believe are in the Jamaica region, and they had a split with the [Hales's.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1163s) And, I mean, they seem pretty loopy in their own way, in my opinion, from looking around their website.

There's some quite bizarre things there, like there's these prayers like consigning Bruce Hales to hell and all this kind of thing. But they have got this letter on there, and it's a photocopy, handwritten letter from John Hales to Brian Deck of Motueka, and he, John Hales, is apologising for a whole bunch of things. And I've just brought it up because it's actually...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1194s)

Cheryl's got it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1195s)

Oh, have you got it? Do you want me to pull it up? Yeah, well, I've just pulled it up, but just to give people, you know, just to kind of, I guess, ratify what Neville's saying, John and Old Bruce Hales were withdrawn from only within a year, right? They were first withdrawn from in 1965, so within six months or a year of these Motueka and Blenheim incidents that Neville's talking about.

And but yeah, this, I mean, if I read out some of this letter, it says it was written in November 1965\. So John Hales, I believe he was shut up or withdrawn from while he wrote this letter. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1237s) yeah, it's to Brian Deck, and he says, "I have sinned against you and your wife and household and the saints in the assembly in Motueka at the meetings in May. My course has not been in the spirit but in the flesh, and there has been much transgression."

And then he goes on and he says, "Much that was offensive in speaking and unbecoming was allowed in the meetings. I think in particular of the way I spoke to one brother concerning his contribution to the special collection," which is the financial offering [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1268s) those who don't know what that means. So it was obviously somebody was harangued for the amount of money they gave or didn't give. And he says, "This was wholly anti-Christian and grievously injurious." And yeah, there are references to other brothers concerning their private income. “It brought in the spirit of the world and commerce and worldly advantage and ridiculing of a saint of God.”

And he goes on and on like there's, you know, we'll put the link in the notes and you guys can all have a look at it yourself, but [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1298s) confesses to like a whole bunch of things, particularly as Neville said, around how him and his brother, well, he's only apologising for himself there, but spoke to others in the meeting and in the personal households. And wow. So I was shocked when I heard that letter because to put it into context for my generation, we were raised being taught that John Hales was sinless.

Like I went to the brethren Bible studies school, like their school, and we got given Bible studies notes written by brethren, and I remember in one of the notes it said J.S.H. was sinless and that it was wrong, he should have never been put out because it was a sinless man that was withdrawn from, and this kind of thing. And yeah, so for me to come across this repentance letter, I'm like, what the heck? Like, how does [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1349s) stack up? Sorry, sorry, that's a big way, but...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1352s)

Yeah, no, when I got my hands on that letter, I couldn't believe my luck, because this is the perfect man according to the world leader today. Yeah. So what I did was, and I'll cover it later, but when we sent out those letters to 900 homes and then 600 homes, I put a copy of that letter in 600 envelopes. Man, did that stir the tribe. Oh, the sparks really flew, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1383s) everybody read it before the priest could say, "Don't read it."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1386s)

Oh my gosh. Because I'm guessing that on the inside, they would have done everything they could to eradicate that letter and to remove any copies of it. Like, I'd never heard it mentioned of, right, Cheryl?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1398s)

Never heard of it. No. I mean, I was going through all the stuff Neville was sending me, like, I was giddy as a kid on Christmas because we, and this is why it's so important to have this generation have their stories told. Because it's so important for us to have this history. It's so important for us to have this history. So I'll let you go on there, Neville.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1420s)

Yep. Yeah, I've also got another 500 pages here I haven't sent you, so I won't send them. Um, yeah, so that's the hub. But the point of bringing up Old Bruce Hales is the problem was when they went on from that and did wrong things, he was given so many accolades for what happened in Motueka regarding the Blenheim matter that this guy, this young guy has come along, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1451s) after 20 years, world leaders trying to handle it, this young guy's come along with all the skills, he's handled it. He went up in everybody's estimation, which then made it difficult, yeah, which then made it difficult for us to say he was doing wrong things. So that's the reason why I'm...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1469s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1470s)

And of course, when they came on, they wrecked a lot of businesses. They hurt my family business because they changed everything and made people go bigger whether they had money or not.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1486s)

They were having, I don't know, like, it's wacky, isn't it, from my perspective to hear even back then, like how many years ago is this? 40, 50, 60 years ago, even back then, they weren't just coming over for religious or church or spiritual meetings, but they were like directly getting involved into household and family businesses and finances. Like, it's strange, isn't it? It's just not normally...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1515s)

And bringing and bringing that financial side into the meeting. Yeah, because they were bringing it into the meeting as well. And I remember they bailed up one person in New Zealand here, up in Thames, and they would find out, ask you how much you had in the bank and all this sort of thing, just like they're doing now. And went to this person's home and all the bigwigs were there, and the evening was quite early, it was only like half past eight or something. And he turned to this [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1546s) guy, Judd, and he said, "Oh, how much money you got in the bank, Judd?" What the audacity. The old guy stood up and he said, "Well," he said, "I've got a credit in the bank." He said, "I think it's time I went to bed." And he went to bed and left 20 people in his lounge to finish off the evening. What a crack up. So that's what was going on back in '65.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1576s)

Wow. The audacity. Again, I'm like, these guys were only in their 30s at this stage.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1581s)

True, true.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1583s)

Very arrogant, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1585s)

Yeah, terrible. And that arrogant, hit anybody how you like, make them do what you want. That whole arrogant line, the brethren have never, ever recovered from what we saw in 1965\. They've never recovered. They're still under that shadow of the old people are worth nothing. Do what you're told or I'll get a case against you. That started in '65 with the Hales family, I think the most [awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1615s) family that's ever joined the Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1618s)

Wow, interesting. 1968\.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1622s)

I married my wife Philippa here, Philippa Jensen, from a family that came from Sweden.

Then of course, 1970, we get Aberdeen. Of course, was another massive step in the wrong direction. And we won't go into, I won't go into all that now, but I have got some papers here that I got from JTJr.'s daughter-in-law about one or two things that I think I've sent you, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1655s)

Yeah, we'll go through that.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1657s)

Just so that I'm not adding or exaggerating anything.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1661s)

So you were about 20 then, were you, Neville?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1667s)

I think in 1970...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1672s)

Oh, sorry. Yeah, how old were you?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1675s)

About 30\.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1677s)

Oh, you were about 30\. Okay, yeah. Late 20s. You had a wife and you'd begun to have kids, had you?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1683s)

Yeah. When was our first child? What year? Yeah, 1970\. Yeah. We were into all the usual things married couples get involved in.

1975, of course, came to the awful interchange where we had to go to Nelson twice a week, once on Sunday and once on a weeknight. Twice a week with normally with your family or you'd be asked questions. And that was a bus trip on Wednesday night. So that started a new thing between localities, which was really bad because out here in New Zealand, if we don't offend anybody, we talk about piddling in other people's pockets.

And that's what happened. A leader from here would go to Nelson and get invited to take the reading meeting, knowing that if he invited him, when he came back to Blenheim, because they came to Blenheim as well from Nelson, then that person that got invited would invite his friend in Blenheim to take the meeting. So we ended up listening to the same people all the time, [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1757s) piddling in each other's pockets to take meetings. So they weren't qualified to take anything.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1761s)

And what was the, what was the drive time, just to help people wrap their head around what you were, what as a family people were being forced to do twice a week?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1772s)

Two hours, but two hours to cover everything.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1775s)

You mean to go from A to B?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1778s)

Yeah, two hours there, two hours back. Holy smokes. Wow. With your family that's what they'd fight and scrap in the car, because they've been up six o'clock in the morning for the breaking of bread. Yeah. Then if you got caught with a tape recorder in your car trying to keep your family entertained while you're driving and everything, you get into trouble for that too.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1800s)

Oh, that's horrific. And for like little babies and pregnant mothers and...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1805s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1805s)

And not to mention working fathers working hard all week and then having to do that on an evening and then again on a Sunday. It really, it's, yeah, I think there's been, I don't know about the rest of the world, but yeah, here I know up north in Auckland, there are some really long interchange trips and they're just dangerous, not to mention costly with the petrol, but it's so dangerous with the sleeping drivers or the drinking drivers, as the case often would be as well.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1835s)

Yeah, and I just had a vehicle accident around about that time and gone 500 feet over a bluff when I was bulldozing and ended up with cervical fusion and everything else. We went 500 feet before the cab came off and I came out with all the gear. Oh, wow. Didn't know much more till the next day. And so I hadn't recovered from that, and traveling in a car was very, very difficult for me. That's why I bought the farm [bike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1865s), Cheryl, was because traveling in the car was difficult for me.

Yeah, and when I went to the doctor in Nelson, which I did for nine months, I just rode my little farm bike at 50k all the way to Nelson and all the way back every week, because when I got there in a car, I was so ill, I couldn't walk into the surgery. So I'd go over to Nelson to the meeting, and I'd often sleep in the car during all the reading meeting to get well enough to get out of the car for the break and then the [preaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1895s) before we came back to Blenheim. So it made a pretty busy week of it, I can tell you. And they had no compassion about sickness, illness, accidents, or anything else. If you didn't perform the same as everybody else, then you were in trouble.

And it was that year that my mother, near enough to that year, when my mother was withdrawn from, which is one of the horrific, cruel priestly states, which is all written in my book.

'79, we were shut up, and I'll go into that a bit later. But all I did was I got up and I said, "We've got two laws in here, one for the rich and one for the poor, and it's not right." And within 60 seconds, I was out the door and the wife and children are gone. Never saw anybody again. Just as quick as that. Where they should have sat down and said, "Well, hang on a minute, let's look at your concerns in case you're right." [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1961s) was right. It's still happening today.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1963s)

I was going to say, 45 years later, how many years later, it's still going on.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1967s)

Yep. I'm just writing to the brethren in Blenheim here now, and I've got the letter finished, and I put in it, "If I ever come back and meet with you people again, the last seven words I said when I walked out will be the first seven words that I say again when I walk in," because they've still got the same problem. Yeah. Anyway, that's why we were, that's why we were kicked out, shut up, I should say, which made it very difficult then to [run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=1997s) my business because I had all brethren people working for me.

And to teach somebody how you cut trees out of a 60-foot boom standing in a 44-gallon drum and not fall out and fall 40 foot to the ground and kill yourself or whatever takes a long time. And I wasn't well enough to actually be working and go to all the meetings, plus train people to drive a big four-wheel drive tractor on hill country development, which was very steep country and dangerous, and [bulldozing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2033s), plus the tree topper. To lose all those people almost overnight virtually just collapsed my business.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2041s)

So you mean they, because you were shut up or withdrawn from, are you saying that all your brethren employees just handed in their notice?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2052s)

Well, yeah, they didn't do it immediately, but they said, "Well, if this," after, you know, after a while being shut up, they said, "Well, look, if this is going to go on, we can't do this. We need to buy your business." So I sold those three parts of my business. One of them I gave away with, you know, no goodwill or anything else, and just let them go because in the meantime, I'd been so unwell that I'd gone back onto [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2082s) land and got into growing grapes the first year that Marlborough had grapes.

So with the contracting, I was also developing a vineyard. So I then concentrated totally on that and let the other go. But the trouble was, those three businesses were my cash flow to do the developing, and we had no money. We weren't rich in any, we were just getting through. So I lost my cash flow, which was [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2112s) big issue. And I stayed with the vineyard. And then in 1980, after a lot of treatment, a lot of doctors, they said they were going to give me a spinal, a cervical fusion they call it, where they take bone off your hip, put it between the offending vertebra, and then fuse them together to take the weight off the nerve because I had terrible depression.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2143s) I'm not a depressed person, but it got so bad I wouldn't let my wife pull the curtains in the morning because I'd see daylight and I'd see the lawns needed mowing, and I'm in bed and I've got people working for me. So I had serious depression. But as soon as I had the spinal operation, the depression was leaving me the first time I got out of bed. And I looked out of the window in the hospital and I thought, "Oh, those lawns look as if they need mowing. I wish I could mow them." I knew straight away that they'd got the pinched nerve that was causing the depression. But I was so weak, I could hardly walk.

And it was that sitting position that made it difficult for me to drive in cars. We're on a bike with my legs hanging down and the wind holding my chin up because I had to wear a neck collar for about seven years, big rubber neck collar. Wow. And that's when my little bike came into it that they wanted me to get rid of, which I wasn't going to get rid of. So 1980, had my spinal operation, shut up at the time, so nobody could come and see me. 1981, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2214s) were both, we were both withdrawn from.

We could only contact two cousins that were out and two brother-in-laws that were out. And just a little record here, which went into the Marlborough Express here, from 1959 through to then, we lost 126 relatives that we never ever saw again, not going past second cousins. That just shows how huge this 1959 separation issue was. Yeah, and I could name all of those, so that was added up correctly.

Okay, we're getting down now. 1983, we finally went to the OB fellowship to try and keep in touch with the Christian faith. And we couldn't, we couldn't, we couldn't believe our luck. We walked in and we were welcomed. We found out they judged evil, which we were told that they never ever did, and that's why they were a very wicked church. And I thought, "I'll test them out." So I [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2284s), "Well, look, if anything goes wrong and you're going to judge somebody, how much would you tell me?" Because we were never allowed to know anything through the priestly service.

And they said, "You ask any question about any administration matter, we will sit you down and tell you everything." I thought, "I just can't believe my luck." That was so much the opposite. And what we were struggling with in the EBs, that they were open, they would judge evil, but they wouldn't hide it. The priest wouldn't hide anything from [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2319s), which is what they were doing. And the other thing that is worth mentioning there too, in 1965, very, very important thing. Up until '65, you were allowed to attend your own assembly meeting, and I remember...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2337s)

This is very, yeah, this is an interesting point.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2340s)

This is critical. If they had done that, Pip and I would not be able to fellowship today because I would have stood up and said, "You guys are lying. You're lying. I never did that." I heard an Ivory and a McCallum, and when the brother outlined their case, he then turned to the McCallum person and said, "Well, what do you say about that evidence? Are you happy with what I've [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2370s) the brethren?" And he said, "Yes." He said, "What you said about me is totally fair." And we withdrew from him. He could never go out and badmouth the brethren like I do, yeah, because he was asked. And that was a killer shot when they wouldn't let you come and have a right of reply. The priest can lie till the cows come home.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2393s)

Yes, I couldn't agree more. Yeah, interesting for again, the younger generation for us to hear that because we didn't not even know that it was any other way. But so you're saying that before anything, it was before 1965, is that right?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2409s)

By '65, that was the end of anybody being allowed to go to their assembly meeting.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2417s)

Yeah, and so before that, people could go and would have a chance to speak. They were invited. They were asked to come.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2426s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2426s)

So that the brethren could all discern together, right, as to the truth of the situation. Whereas I completely agree that refusing to allow people to have a chance to speak for themselves, it's placed far too much unfettered power in the hands of the priests. And yeah, I just think of my own father, it's still happening because he was kicked out, was it, about two years ago. And again, his belief is that he was kicked out on completely [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2457s) a complete, there's no basis for it. And yet he's never been able to give that chance to express to his brethren and his family members and everything, "This is my side of the story. This is what's going on." So it places a huge amount of power in the hands of the priests, unfettered.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2475s)

Yeah. Disciplinary action should be in the control of the brethren church. It should not be in control of a priest.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2484s)

Correct. And this is where, this is where we lose so much control over the narratives that they give, right? Because I mean, some of the narratives that land on my lap about people are literally insane. And I mean that to the utmost definition of insanity. And I always have to correct people. I'm like, "That is not why that person is out. That's not why that person left." And I do think that if this was [corrected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2515s), that it would really give a lot of respect back to the PBCC if they could correct this, where people were allowed to come back and stand up for themselves and say, have their say to everybody instead of it just being this twisted narrative that they give.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2530s)

Yeah, going back, going back over the history of assembly meetings in Blenheim, right back to when I was 12, I believe there's only one person that should ever have been withdrawn from out of everybody that's gone. There's only one, only one person who was a rapist and a child molester. He should have gone. Everybody else could easily have been covered and amended. It was all through wrong priestly treatment that those people lost so much. All these issues are right in the priestly, at the priestly level.

It took me 20 years, after I was out, took me 20 years to find out why we were withdrawn from. And I had to get it from somebody from Dargaville. I mean, it's just mind-boggling stuff.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2587s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2587s)

They get away with it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2590s)

And they're doing the same tricks today. That's what's fascinating, right? It's like he's saying this stuff from 40, 50 years ago and it's like, oh my gosh, these are the same playbook that they're operating by now. You can't find out what you got withdrawn from. They won't tell you. Well, it's bizarre.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2607s)

That's why I think this history is quite important to any members of the brethren who are listening to these podcasts.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2615s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2616s)

What they're seeing there now hasn't only just happened. It's got seeds and tentacles that are way back, all started mainly with the Hales family.

Yeah, so 1990, after I had had my op and I was recovering from the depression, but my body was still terribly weak. I still couldn't wear boots to go to work, and I normally wear heavy boots, you know, I'm a hunter and all the rest of it. I had to wear sand shoes. And to climb up into my vineyard shed, the last four steps, I would have to crawl up in the prime of my life. That's weakness. So [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2662s) joined New Zealand's biggest health food company, sold the vineyard, and spent four years, went overseas with them to a couple of countries, and built a business in New Zealand's largest health and food company.

And within eight weeks on their products, I was a completely changed person. I could run down the paddock with my boots on within eight weeks of taking their products. So I said, "Right, I'm going to join you." So I went into network marketing and built a team of 740 people in four countries, [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2692s) using the product. And I'm on it today. And I'm just out of hospital from a prostate operation plus five weeks of radiation. And they said it's the first time in the hospital that anybody has ever walked out of that horrific treatment and gone back to work the very next day and did 12 hours work. Wow.

So that was a very, very important change in my life. That changed my life once I got my health back. [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2723s), we went into the, we went, we went into the sounds and bought a farm that was derelict and re-established it into forestry and 11 blocks, planted 330,000 trees, bulldozed the roads, did everything that you had to do to sell a property. That's where we still are today. And it got us out of town too, away from the EBs picking on us and coming up with their lights off at night and all this sort of thing. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2753s) that's an important part of our life now.

In 1999, we got the internet, and that was a huge step forward for us because we got onto the Ex-peeb website and started to join up with people that we didn't even know were withdrawn from.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2774s)

Oh, wow. What was the name of that site, Neville?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2776s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2777s)

Yeah, which was shut down after being litigated by the brethren, I understand.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2782s)

Correct. Yeah, that was a huge help to people like us that had just been thrown out into the world, lost contact with everybody, but didn't know who to talk to. And all of a sudden, we saw this person's out, I will ring them. So our whole life started to come back together again.

Well, we went into farm stay then, international type farm stay on the property with fishing and hunting safaris. Then 9/11 hit, and of course, we had to stop because there was no international travel. So we came back into town, bought a house here as well, which is where I am today. We did that at 9/11 and started building jetties in the Sound, which [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2833s) just sold my business after 23 years, piling and building heavy structures in the water. I've just sold it, so I'm technically retired at 80, yeah.

You're 80? My goodness. Yeah, three months to go and we're there.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2855s)

Oh my gosh, you're looking very well for 80\. I would never guess you're 80\.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnhvYU5qgp2M%26t%3D2860s)

I can still climb the mountain hunting, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2864s)

Yeah, you've got enough energy for 10 men, I'd say.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2869s)

Then of course, the fake global review started, and that was a very interesting time in my life with all these jerks in my lounge trying to put it across me and saying sorry for things they weren't sorry for, which I proved. So yeah, that went around the world, of course. But we had some really interesting sessions. I got a wee bit more of that in categories, so I won't hold you up now. The next year, a lot of hypocrisy, the brethren were coming out to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2900s) sounds where we were, going hunting with me, going fishing with me. I mean, it was just unreal what was going on. But they wouldn't come inside the house. They'd do everything else, but they wouldn't step inside the door. Really weird.

2007, yeah, because the house is sort of, you know, that's a very private, very private place. We did a, Pip and I did a TV documentary on the local TV news here in New [Zealand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2930s). And we went over a number of things, and it came to alcohol at the end of the documentary. And I said what I thought, but I didn't go overboard because I wasn't going to lie about anything. But afterwards, my brother-in-law faced me up with it. He said, "We listened to your documentary, and everything you said was true, except when you got to drink, and then you went overboard."

So I tell you, that started a discussion that you wouldn't want to print on a bit of paper, because I said, "I never went halfway towards the problems that you've got." And I said, "The way you're feeding whiskey into young people 12 years of age, you should go to jail." Yeah. And finally, after a stand-up battle for nearly an hour on his property, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=2982s) said to me, "Oh, well, Nev, you know, it's all the young, it's all the young people have got to do." I thought, "I can't believe what I've just heard from a Christian church. They're feeding the young people on whiskey because there's nothing else for them to do." And that was true. They didn't have anything else to do. They couldn't go camping, they couldn't go fishing, they couldn't do anything else. So stay at home and drink alcohol. Terrible way.

So what happened then, the newspaper [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3012s) involved, and we did a, they asked for 1,300 words, and I gave them a whole page, 4,000 words or whatever. I called them the Gestapo, the Holocaust. I just went straight for the jugular. And they came back to me and they said, "We don't believe it, but we're going to print the whole thing." I said, "You what? The whole page?" And they said, "The only thing we're going to take out, we'll leave Gestapo in," which they [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3042s), "but we're going to take Holocaust out."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3044s)

Oh my god. Out of respect to the Jews, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3051s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3052s)

So do you have copies of these? Do you have a copy of like, do you have a link for the documentary and a link, like do we have copies that we can give to the viewers later? Yeah, so I'll get that from you.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3062s)

That's amazing. That's incredible, Neville, that they printed that. I didn't realize this. What approximate year would this have been?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3071s)

It's about 2007\. I thought they'd come back and say that paragraph and that one's out, and it would come back to the 1,300 words they asked for or whatever the words were.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3089s)

Yeah, this is intriguing for me because I left or got kicked out in the year 2008, and I seem to remember that at that point, like I didn't really know who you were, but somewhere I'd heard whispers of this name, Neville McCallum, and it was just like you were the devil incarnate at that time. Like it was, it was like, "Neville is the worst." And I think Leon Jensen as well, right? It was like these two guys were just [horrendously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3119s) evil.

Yeah, I remember that because then I remember shortly after leaving or something, you contacted me and I was terrified because I was like, "Yeah, he's this evil opposer." And then I met you and you were so not scary and so like normal. It was like, "What?" Yeah. It was so, then explains why you were perceived as so evil around 2007 and 2008, is because you were in the middle of going public with the truth.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3149s)

Yes, with the truth. Yeah. Yeah, I think it wasn't a full page, the writing wasn't a full page quite, but the next page, a whole page of the newspaper was my dial. My family nearly fainted. I came home and they were white. They said, "You know what they put in the paper?" A whole, and it was one of the big old papers, not the little ones. A full frontal of my dial and face. And my son came, my [son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3181s) came around and he saw it and he got a pen and he wrote right across it, "Wanted: Dead or Alive."

So that was quite funny. But what happened was, that's what gave birth to my book. Because what happened after that, people would meet me in the street who knew me, because it's a small town, we've been here all this time. They'd say, "We saw your paper report or your TV documentary, but we do business with the brethren, we [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3211s) next to the brethren or whatever, and we don't see the things that you've said about them are actually factual. So is it really true what you have said?" And I said to Pip, "Well, I'm going to fix this." So that's, I wrote the book. And when anybody said that to me after that, I'd go around and give them a book. I said, "That's for you. You tell me." And they'd come back to me and say, "You never even told half the truth," because in the book was twice as much as what I had told them on the TV documentary. So [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3241s) what gave birth to the book.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3245s)

And by the book, you mean this account of your experiences, which is titled *Cast Outside the Camp*.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3251s)

Correct.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3252s)

Which you are happy to make that available to anyone who wants it, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3256s)

Yeah, well, I'll touch. So what I'll do at the end of this podcast is I'll have a link to a folder that has all of Neville's stuff that he's willing to share. Because I am sure, I think this needs to be public information, and I'm sure there are a lot of people who would sift through it and find all of this very, very interesting and intriguing and answering a lot of questions from Neville's generation. I think this is super important.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3280s)

Well, I wanted the book too, not only to convince the world that what I said publicly was true, but when we went through what we went through in three years of interrogation, I thought anybody facing that would do well to read the book and see how crooked and how criminal these priests are. So whenever I heard if somebody was in trouble, I'd give them a book. Then they'd read what we went through and prepare them for what they had to face.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3307s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3308s)

And then somebody went and put it on the internet, which I did not do. And they put it on the internet, and we got calls from, I don't know how many countries around the world. For the next two or three years, we mailed the book out at cost around to different countries where people wanted it. Took it to England when she went there, and copies went over there. So a lot of copies have gone out over the years, even though we don't advertise the fact.

Yeah, then after that, with [Leon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3339s) as well and Peter Harrison, I got those two people involved writing to the brethren's homes to try and put some of this evidence into the brethren's homes of what was going on. And there's 900 houses in New Zealand, and we mailed out, I think, an eight-page letter to 900 homes, which was quite expensive. Yeah. And then there was a hue and a cry [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3369s) that, and persons were threatened with withdrawal if they read it, because we had Hushai’s in there that were coming back telling us what was happening with the letters. It was really good.

And then we decided, I decided to do another one. I think after that first letter, Peter pulled out because of the financial side, and Leon pulled out because some of his family was still in the meeting and he didn't want to upset them. So I went it alone. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3399s) I thought, "Well, this time, to save them all getting ripped up and so the leaders don't get them, I'll do 600 homes." But I picked, went through with Leon, and we picked out all the people that we considered to be fringes, like me, that were sort of not in leadership. So the leadership never got a copy. And so we picked 600 homes of people that were on the fence and gave them a letter so they wouldn't tell the superiors they had it. They'd want to read it.

[Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3430s) what happened was when some didn't get a letter, they would go racing around to the next person's home saying, "Oh, I haven't got a letter. Can I have yours? What does it say?" So we realized from that there was genuine interest. But a funny, just a little bit of humor that goes with that is that Gordon, what's his name, in Thames, the family of 14 got [withdrawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3461s) from and really went through the mill as bad as anybody ever did. And when he thought he'd better try and get back in, he confessed to the priests that he'd committed adultery. And he thought, "Well, I'll hear." So the fact they took his wife and his 14 kids off him, he ended up in somebody else's bed. So he thought he'd better be honest. So he did. Alan Davis was one of the priests and he said, "Well, you know, you've got to keep the jelly [beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3491s) flowing." You know, can you imagine a priest saying that to somebody who's confessed to adultery?

So what I did, I wrote a report on the Gordon case. I stuck it in the 600 letters. I put a jelly bean in every letter, so I had to go and buy 600 flaming jelly beans. But to Alan Davis's address, I didn't give him a letter. I bought him a whole 2 kg bag of jelly beans and just couriered the whole thing to his house the same day as all the brethren got one jelly bean. I mean, we're just killing ourselves laughing back here.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3531s)

Oh my gosh.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3534s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3537s)

You sure do things out of the box.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3538s)

Yeah, so that totaled over 20,000 pages we photocopied and put into sealed envelopes. Wow.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3547s)

Wow.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3548s)

And then of course, there was a letter to the big four, which we can cover a wee bit later. Just so we get through this. And then from 2010 on, because we had the property in the sounds and it was out of town, it was a place we could help people that wanted help so the EBs couldn't see them, hear them, smell them, follow them, do anything with them. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3578s) we started helping them by taking them into the sounds, even offering not to eat with them if that was the case. We'll eat separate, but just get out of it and get your brain clear and make some decent decisions.

So we've used the property for that right up until today, and it gets used a lot for that. And some people are still coming back after 20 years when they first came.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3601s)

Wow, that's so generous.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3604s)

It's boat access only because the PBs aren't allowed boats, so they can't chase us. Yeah, because we're 12 miles in a boat, so we're a little bit remote, which is really good. So yeah, so we use that, we use that today. We had people down there only in the last month, just lost eight, just lost eight children, flogged half a million off him, out of his mind. So we take him down there for two or three nights and just let him have a look at [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3634s) stars and the bird singing and just try and get away from the pressure.

So nearly at the finish, in 2020, of course, got involved with the Royal Commission. And they said, "Well, what have you got for us? Have you got any hard copies, evidence of black and white letters or anything else?" I was able to give them 186 pages of hard, hard evidence in writing. They couldn't believe their luck, with signatures and everything else. So they got a lot of material to help them with what they're doing at the moment. Yeah. And that's about it.

Two weekends ago, we had a church group in, 18 [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3678s) was hunting and fishing, and they're chosen, they're the poorer people in that church which can never afford to go fishing or go into the sounds. They come out, they shot a deer, they caught 70 fish. So they went home with a chilly bin full of fish fillets and a nice venison steak or two to their families. So we promote, we promote the help for the poor because that's what we've had, that's what we've done since we've come out, because they [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3708s) the people that need it, not the priests, the poorer people.

And then last weekend, we had 40 people from their own church through. Most of those never afford to get on a launch and go out into the sounds, and we put a picnic day on for them and let our tame deer out around the lawn so the kids could play with and cuddle the deer and give them a sandwich. And we quite enjoy, we've done that for quite a few years now. So that's one of the reasons we like the property we've [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3738s) in the sound. Yeah, so that brings us to today.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3744s)

Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3745s)

We've just rebooted what you started all those years ago.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3746s)

Yeah. Well, a lot of those things we talked about just now, we didn't go into any detail over them. It was just a history run, which some people do enjoy, dates. When they look back, "I wonder when that started," or, "I wonder when that happened." So dates can be interesting. But I didn't think that would have read right if I'd included all the categories and their titles [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3781s) into the line of the date history. It would have made it really complicated.

The brethren's original plan when they left the established churches was evangelism. It was so powerful in New Zealand, I can't speak for any other country, but in New Zealand, it emptied the churches around New Zealand. Even some of the clergymen closed their churches and came and joined the Brethren [movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3811s) because it brought life back into the church. So it was a very, very powerful movement.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3819s)

So you're talking about like the 19th century type of stuff?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3826s)

No, mid-1800s.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3827s)

Yeah, okay. So you're talking about Darby and straight after him and all that sort of thing, yeah?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3834s)

Yes, where the division had just happened in England between OBs and Exclusive Brethren. That division had just happened. And when J.G. Deck came to New Zealand, who my brother-in-law is a Deck, one of his great-great-grandchildren is my brother-in-law, he came to Motueka, and my great-grandfather from here linked up with him. [Probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3864s) rode a horse to Motueka from Blenheim, which had taken probably eight or ten hours or more, or two days, and linked up with Deck and the beginning of the Exclusive Brethren in Motueka. And then Darby came out after that to see how Deck was getting on, and he wasn't very happy with Deck preaching in the OB halls as well as Exclusive Brethren halls.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3888s)

Right.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3890s)

And he put a stop to that.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3892s)

Because J.G. Deck was a bit more open, wasn't he?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3895s)

He was a bit more open, and he might not have agreed with the separation being so severe from Darby, which created the division. I'm just shutting the window for noise. And I knew an old man, Malcolm, which I knew and talked to him. I liked the old guy. And at five years old, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3926s) could remember sitting on JND's knee in his family home in Nelson. Wow. And I would think, I have got no proof of this, but I would have thought with such an important meeting with Darby coming to Nelson, that my family from Blenheim would have gone over to the fellowship meetings and ridden their horses and got over there for the Darby meeting, I would presume. Yeah.

So evangelism was the key thing. Evangelism and the rapture were the two things that were never taught in the cold established churches. Those two. And that's what Darby was strong on. And that's what triggered the Exclusive Brethren. And that's why I say in '59, separation stopped evangelism. It tore the heart and soul out of the brethren in '59. It totally [debased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3989s) the Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3991s)

Right, this thing that had given them life and made them different from the established church.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=3997s)

Yes. And what people need to realize, anybody listening to this podcast from inside the Exclusive Brethren, you need to realize that it once worked properly, yeah, and it can go back to that. You people in there, you've got to realize that prior to '59, it was one of the greatest churches to be in. We associated with other Christian people, even with worldly people that weren't Christians. We respected them, and they might have been our neighbors, and we'd have a cup of tea with them or help them. [We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4035s) were integrated into society as we should have been in the Christian faith.

But it all got ripped out of us in '59. And we did things like we do with our picnic day. You can't get to know people just sitting in a concrete room. You've got to get out into real life to understand people. And that's what the church has found from Nelson when they bring the fishing and hunting group over, which is anything from 18 to 21 people. They said [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4065s) difference that made to those young couples when they could come and talk to their friend for two days and two nights and do the normal things in life without sitting in a church, it just opened up a new world for them. And they said their attendance at the church meetings was better. They got involved in things in the church. They said the weekends have been a real blessing to them.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4088s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4089s)

Because it's real life.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4091s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4092s)

And that's what we had prior to '59. There was a balance between nature and church and sporting and just communication between people. So in '59, we had the collapse of the brethren, I felt, and the separation came in, which created a room of fire. So what it did was, we turned inwards and it created an environment, I say, for the mass production of infidels. That's exactly what it's done. Exactly what it's done. Nobody can get away without tormenting them and wrecking them. So people are just fixed in there.

[There's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4147s) a note here from JND, your JND volume three. "The first fruit from this bad root is the brethren are occupied with themselves with the exclusion of other Christians who are equally members of the body of Christ." This is JND that the EBs preach. So here's a bit they don't want to hear because they only tell you and I [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4180s) they want to hear. "It is of the most importance that we should certainly remember, I continually remember, that brethren are a testimony and nothing else."

And another place, JND says, "If you call yourself the church at the expense of other people, it is the worst sin on the face of the earth." And I hope people listening who are inside are listening to what I'm saying because that's JND word for word.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4213s)

Yeah. They don't want them reading JND anymore?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4217s)

No. No, true. So that's just a couple of little notes there. And as for the separation thing, I remember it being explained, the great house, as Christendom's called, the great house, the wine glass doesn't say to the potty chamber, "You're not as important as me. We don't need you in here." The great house accommodates everything that's needed in a great house: the rich, the poor, the weak, the stumbling, everybody. That's the idea of the great house. So to take one thing out of the great house and say, "Well, we don't want these people because they don't belong to us," it's out of keeping with JND, FER's ministry, etc.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4271s)

Well, and it's out of keeping with the metaphor that was originally intended in 2 Timothy 2, right? I mean...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4279s)

And of course, as you would know, they have adulterated that verse in 2 Timothy 2 now, taking the brackets out. Yeah. And Revelation says, "You do that, you altered the text of this book, and I will add plagues to you." And that's exactly one of the red lines that the brethren have crossed. They've crossed two red lines. One, they alter scripture. And second, just recently, they encouraged the brethren to go to the breaking of bread. And [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4309s) waited 40 years for this. They've encouraged the brethren to go to the breaking of bread the other day because it would make B.D.H. happy.

The day the focus came off Jesus Christ and his death at the breaking of bread to a man, there's no mandate for them to run a church. It's gone.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4333s)

That has been really indoctrinated lately to them. Like, that's, you talk to a lot of recent leavers or people who are still inside, and that is what the Lord's Supper has become about. It has not become about Jesus at all. It has become about... Yeah, I mean, like...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4350s)

I mean, when I left 15 years ago, it was incredibly common to have that kind of switch happening. And for example, the gospel preachings, like they would say things like, "Oh, if only we knew how much our beloved brother loved us, we would turn from our sin, repent, and commit our ways to following him." You know, like they would sub him in for Jesus. That was common in more like the gospel preachings. But are you saying that like Bruce is brought into the Lord's Supper service somehow? And I'm curious about how they do that because the [hymns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4380s), as far as I know, the hymns don't specifically reference Bruce yet. So like, is that, yeah, how do they do that?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4388s)

No, it's the reasoning for going. So the reason you go...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4391s)

...to the beloved brother.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4394s)

Yeah, it would please him. The focus is not on Christ to go to the breaking of bread, it's on Bruce Hales. Yeah. That's a serious red line to cross. And I wondered when that would ever be crossed. I know of one instance where a young person prayed and worshiped Bruce Hales and somebody complained about it. And guess who got dealt with? The person who complained. And the person who got away with it.

So I have heard of that once. But as you say, Cheryl, you picked up on it correctly. The reason for going was not what the breaking of bread is about. And I felt that was about, once they defiled the breaking of bread, there's nothing left. Yeah, the whole thing as a Christian assembly has gone. And of course, when Stanley McCallum came out, he [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4450s) was rejected. His ministry was rejected by J.T. Taylor and the ministry he gave in New Zealand, which Taylor felt opened up the use of sort of picnicking with boats or owning a batch or whatever. And I remember harsh words coming out against Stanley Mack after that, from about '65 or whenever it was onwards.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4480s)

So is he no relative to you, Neville, even though it's the same surname?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4486s)

No, no relative. No, no, not at all. And the other thing that most people don't know this one, JTJr. tried to reverse the separation issue of '59, and I haven't found anybody that knows this. I heard about it. JTJr. in '65 tried to reverse what he had done in '59. I heard he had a meeting with the Hales’s, I think it was in Sydney. So I made inquiries over there, and I found out a person who went to that meeting with the Hales’s. This is Old Bruce and John.

And I got in touch with them, and I can't find it now, but I will. I've got another hundreds of pages to go through. I got in touch with this person and got them to put it in writing for me and sign it because it was one of the most important documents I've got. The Hales’s withstood him and would not let him revoke '59 separation because they had seen that this room of fire that had been created in '59 was just a breeding ground for a cult. That you could hammer these people, get them to do what you wanted because they couldn't run away and pot on you because of the room of fire being the separation issue.

And the Hales’s saw it and thought, "We can't get the control of these people unless we've got that room of fire as a boundary." So [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4604s) wouldn't let JTJr. revoke '59. That would have been, that could possibly have saved the brethren. Wow. Bruce and John stopped it, and I've got that in writing.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4620s)

Sorry, yeah, I've never heard that before. It would be fascinating to hear more about that or to see that.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4625s)

Yes, yeah. So I got that in writing from the person who was at the meeting, and they signed it for me. I haven't been able to find it here, but I know it's in this room somewhere.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4635s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4636s)

I had to do that so I had it in writing.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4638s)

It is interesting to me, again, being a younger generation, I just wasn't aware of this stuff. But just how much power jostling there was, like in that period of late 1959 and up to 1965, and that there was power jostling and that sort of thing happening between JT Junior and Symington and J.S.H. and W.B.H., right? Like, yeah, I just, we were always taught that, oh, if they were all in the same [room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4668s), they would all agree exactly about everything. In reality, it sounds like from multiple sources is that there was quite a bit of disagreement at points about things.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4679s)

Uh, there sure was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4681s)

It's really been a game of chess since then, hasn't it? You know what I mean? Like, it really, this actually, I'm trying not to cry, it breaks my heart because I really, there's just, when you sit in, when you sit in the chair that we sit in, those of us that are like constantly have people that are coming at us and dropping off the stories, it's just, my, your heart gets so full of compassion. Like, just compassion in the sense of you wish so badly this is, this is so easily fixable.

Like, I look at this and if I was in Bruce's position, I would look down at this, this is so easily fixable. Yes, it would be messy, all this would be messy, but it's fixable. But because this game of chess has built up for so many years, and in the Hales's' eyes, [they've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4739s) won right now, the role factor, the fear factor, the absolute hypocrisy of Christianity versus a man-made cult, it's risen to such a disease that it breaks my heart when those stories land on my lap, that it makes me think of like, maybe it's not fixable. But I do, I am a very naive and gullible person. I like to believe, I [100%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4769s) admit it, I want to believe that these massive miracles could happen. And when I hear of this, like, I'm trying not to cry, like, it's just, it breaks my heart to hear that this opportunity was there all these years ago.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4786s)

It was.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4787s)

I blame what happened on me back to then because I, in my gut, in my soul, I believe that had things been taken care of, had things been looked at the way that, I wouldn't have gone through what I'd gone through. Like, in every fiber of my being, I believe that. And which is why, I guess, I'm so passionate about bringing your generation on now. I think it's so important for us to hear these stories, hear those [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4817s) you that have witnessed this firsthand to our generation that literally has just been had the fire raining on us from John and Bruce Hales.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4828s)

Sure. Yes. And when you get the opportunity to help people like we do, you know, you see the suffering, you see the tears, and it takes you right back, you know, right back to your first days then as well. Yeah. And sometimes, you know, you get a flick of anger, yeah, when you think, "Boy, I just need to tip this thing upside down." Yeah. The brethren get it wrong, and I can [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4858s) this to people who are listening who are in there. People like me, we do not hate the brethren.

No, not at all. No. I mean, if I hated the brethren, why would I have mailed 1,500 letters out, the cost and whatnot of that? I don't hate them at all. No, we wouldn't do what we did if we hated them. And you can't shorten God's hand either. He can bring about a recovery. I don't think he would ever try and improve it because there's nothing there to improve. It would have to start again. Yes, I [agree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4888s) with that too. 1958 and started again and put that notice board back up on the wall. Because to take the goodness of the gospel and say, "I'm going to take that and I want all the goodies and life eternal, but I ain't going to share it over here with anybody else," scripture warns you that if you do that, you might even get what you've got taken off you. So that's a serious thing we did in '59 by throwing that notice board with those words on into the toilet.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4918s)

That's a very...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4919s)

Yep. And the other thing that happened in '65 too, and I watched this very carefully, I love the gospel. I saw all the evangelists fired from 1961 to 1965\. Every evangelist got fired, stood down, or withdrawn from. One man in our own locality, one of the Ivories, who had a soul for people outside, just got [shouted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4949s) down and finally withdrew from him. So he couldn't anyway.

And one of the last people was Lionel Larsen, and I'd go to his preaching and I'd think to myself, "Are you going to be evangelical in this preaching or not?" And I'd think, "Oh, yes, you did. You're taking a huge risk. You're going to get your head cut off." And all of a sudden, chop, and he was gone. And he turned around instead of being evangelical, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=4981s) was in old man Malcolm's home in Christchurch, who I used to go to see because these old people had the truth. And I would go and see him when I went to Christchurch, been widowed for many years.

He was in a meeting or talk after a meeting when JTJr. was coming to Christchurch, and he heard Lionel Larsen brief the people in that circle and say, "If JTJr. wants to be involved with [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5011s) wife, you are not to object." Wow. He said, "I heard that with my own ears." He said, "And I've never forgiven him." He said, "That's how low we got." Now, that would have been after Aberdeen or maybe around Aberdeen time, perhaps. So he conveyed that to me, that that's what was said.

And so there was no gospel. And that's why I really worry about people in there that are under 70 years [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5047s) age. They have not heard the gospel. They have not heard the gospel. I'm not saying there's people in there that they're all unsaved. I'm not saying that. I've met one or two that have secretly come and visited me here, we've hid their cars, to tell me that they are saved and how they got converted. And they definitely are. I'm fully aware they are. But anybody 70 or younger has not heard the gospel. And I've told the brethren in this letter I've got here to go [out,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5077s) if an evangelist came in and gave you a preaching that an evangelist would preach, you would wonder what the hang hit you because you've never heard the gospel since 1965\.

I mean, they'll hear, "Oh, well, Jesus died for you and shed his blood for you," and then, "Don't forget to put some money in the collection for Bruce Hales." I mean, that's about the closest they get to an evangelical message. But if they got a full hour, they would want to...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5114s)

And they're encouraged to read the ministry more than they are the Bible and that sort of thing. Absolutely. This is like more than 15 years ago when I was in there, but I remember when I started reading the Gospels properly in the Bible and it was like, man, I hardly know these stories. And, yeah, I think it's also challenging to read the Bible in there when it's the John Nelson Darby version full of 'thees' and 'thys' and 'thous'. Like, it's tricky for people to, you know, get the stories.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5144s)

Yes.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5145s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5146s)

When you do face the brethren up with this, the first thing they'll say, "Oh, no, we do. We go to the world. We go to the street preaching." That is one complete and utter farce. I've spoken to people who've gone up and approached them at the street preaching. One was given a five-minute lecture on how many decades it's been since anybody ever joined. And the next time another person went and spoke to them, they said, "Oh, we're out of town. [We're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5176s) out of time now. We're busy." They turned around and walked away. That's street preaching.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5180s)

Well, I remember I wanted to join in the street preaching when I was in my late teens because I felt that I had, you know, encountered Jesus in a way that had changed my life, and I was full of enthusiasm to share that. And yeah, well, for a start, I was told, "You're a woman, there's no place for you to do that." But secondly, I remember saying to them, "Oh," I was allowed to go and hand out tracts, but I remember saying to them, "Hey, look at these tracts. There's nothing on them. If you give them to people and they want to follow up and have a further [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5211s) with someone, they can't contact you."

Like, they had no, they had nothing to help you find the church, you know, the brethren church. It had no number. And I remember talking about this with a couple of the priests who came to visit me, and they were like, "Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, I think, oh, maybe we should be putting our name and number on the back of those." Like, yeah, but it was like a hit and run, you know? It's like, "I'm going to stand here on the street showing this clock here, and then I'm going to run away because, oh dear, I don't actually want [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5241s) talk with you. We don't actually want you to join the brethren."

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5243s)

No. Once again, you have to dig deep and go back and find the motive for that. One of the motives for that is to try not to have their charitable status taken off them because it's a benefit to the public. So that's one of the reasons. I was in Motueka and I was walking along the street and all of a sudden I saw a Deck and a McLean and a Travers or something on the main street standing there looking very religious. And I thought, "Oh, maybe this is street preaching." It was sort of [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5273s) on lunchtime, and they were standing there and the people were walking past them. There's quite a lot of people in the main street of Motueka walking past them.

And I thought, "Well, I'll go into the side street and stand on the other side of the road so they don't recognize me, and I'll see what they do." Well, when they started to preach, they left the main street where all the people were walking past, and they came around the corner about three meters where there was [nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5304s), and they preached to me across on the opposite side of the street, just so they didn't have to preach to anybody, the three of them. I just stood there grinning and shaking my head as if to say, "I don't believe what I've just witnessed."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5319s)

They didn't want to. Isn't it an awkward way to share the gospel, just standing there yelling at people?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5324s)

Well, the most profitable time I ever had was when I had a paid ministry. And I had a paid ministry to preach the gospel on the street corner when I was young, right in the middle of Blenheim. There's a rotunda square where people gather and whatnot. And across the other side, it was in the dark, at night, we're preaching away there, and I hear, "plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plop," in the gutter. And I look down and there's a penny.

And a few minutes later, "plink, plink, plink," across this 100-meter strip of tar sealing came another penny. And so there were three pennies in the gutter where we were preaching. Some young guys were ridiculing us and throwing, rolling their pennies across the square, and they were mine. I was standing on the money. But there was the policeman standing on the opposite side watching them. And after we finished, he went across [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5389s) he arrested them. Wow. They got fined, and it was in the Marlborough Express paper. That's hilarious. It is, isn't it? So I say I've had a paid ministry without a collection bag to front.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5405s)

It wasn't in white envelopes, was it, Neville?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5409s)

No, no, no, true, true. So yeah, the salvation thing to me, that side of it, the evangelism, I think is the big crash. That's where the whole thing really came to an end. And they turned inwards, had the room of fire, and they just built a cult. Prior to '65, we were pretty much normal. We gave in the special collections and whatnot, but nobody interfered with your bank accounts. Nobody asked you for money unless it was a repair on the hall or something important.

So the whole time, the way finances worked was pretty much just normal up until the Hales's got in. And then they started nosing into people's bank accounts and getting them to alter everything they did and telling us on our orchard and glasshouse tomatoes and the plant nursery how we had [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5475s) do it. We had to have time sheets and we had to write this down and write that down. We didn't even know these jerks and they were running our business for us. And they were making people go in and get bigger, get bigger, put three glass houses up not knowing whether you can afford it or not. And a lot of people actually went under because they did what the Hales's said, because they were looked upon as being young geniuses, and they went and did it. Of course, it went belly up. So they did an enormous amount of damage through this country, huge [damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5505s).

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5506s)

That's interesting because again, that's not really talked about. It's seen as, "Oh, wow, you know, advice from the Hales’s has done this and done that." But yeah, that's not the first time I've heard others say, "Actually, sometimes people took their business advice and it was terrible. It wasn't the right thing."

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5521s)

No, no. Back before the Hales's got involved, we all knew how to run our business. We all made mistakes. Nobody interfered. If anything went wrong, it was my fault, and we worked through those things ourselves. Nobody ever interfered with our families or our income or anything else. But 1965 changed all that. You either got on board with it or you got dealt with. It was as tough as that. And they had the room of fire to do it. [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5552s) was all there.

I made a few notes on the pure line, which we all know is what's driving it at the moment. Totally untrue, as we all know when you look at it carefully. The pure line is in Christendom. It's already in the church. There has been faithfulness from Christ's day right down to our day in the [Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5582s) world. It doesn't depend on the Exclusive Brethren having the right to that. So the pure line is already there. People might have been involved in it like Darby, but it's not all exclusive to the Exclusive Brethren.

It's really, it's really the great lie that has really opened up for the horrors we see today, that you have to obey the pure line or else. When you look back, this started with JT Senior. He gave ministry, two things he did wrong. He gave ministry on a fellowship within the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ. No such thing. There's only one fellowship, that's Christendom.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5638s)

Was it JT Senior, did you say?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5639s)

JT Senior. He started that idea that there was a special fellowship, which is a very dangerous thing to say when there's only one fellowship, the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the other thing he did, and I remember my father really upset about it, he started or condoned the drinking of strong liquor. Started with JT Senior, not JT Junior. So the brethren were getting off track in JT Senior's time, not just at JT Junior's time.

And as I said before, JND said if you claim you're special and you're the church, and if you're special, that means you're a church over and against the Christendom church, he said it's the worst sin on the face of the earth. We're in Christendom, whether we like it or not.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5714s)

Yep. They don't want to believe that though, do they?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5717s)

No, no.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5718s)

They've separated themselves.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5721s)

Yeah. I mean, when you look at the, when you look at the great photo, which I call the photo of shame, I told the brethren that's what I call it. I told them that it's a photo of shame. You've got child molesters, you've got rapists, you've got liars in that photo of shame.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5743s)

I'm sorry, what photo are you referring to?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5746s)

On the wall.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5748s)

Oh, the line of all the leaders, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5751s)

That's the fire, yeah, the Great Men photo. It can be proven to be a letter of shame after the first three, JND, FER, yeah, after the first two. After that, there's error. Well, the others wouldn't claim to be without error. But as we look at it, it started to go wrong with JT Senior talking about a fellowship within a fellowship and bringing in [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5781s) condoning the drinking of strong alcohol. That was JT Senior.

Right. And we have evidence from a person here in New Zealand who as a young woman, only 18 or 19, her father gave her to JT Junior in Australia. She went to bed with him. She was so traumatized in the morning, she spent years and years and years in the mental institution. And she came out, came back to New Zealand here and told a person in New Zealand about it. And that person told Leon Jensen, that's where I got it from, that she had been taken to bed and she had been raped by Taylor, and she [spent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5829s) something like 10 years or whatever in a mental institution before she healed.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5834s)

Wow.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5836s)

You don't find a person saying that unless there's something true in that, you know.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5841s)

That's not a story that's been shared.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5846s)

No. And I spoke to a person in America and she lived close to JTJr., and he kept coming and banging on the door. She's home on her own, banging on the door. Happened about three times. And she thought, "I'm going to call the police if he doesn't stop banging on my door." JTJr.'s wife, what was her name? Irene. Irene, [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5877s) rings this girl, this young woman up and says, "Look, let him in. I promise you he won't touch you, but let him in." And she said, "I let him in." And he said, "Strip to the waist." She said, "I did." And he said, "Thank you," and walked home again.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5895s)

What?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5897s)

Yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5898s)

That is...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5900s)

And a lot of people don't realize Aberdeen didn't stop at Aberdeen. It was worse in New York. I talked to JTJr.'s daughter-in-law. So I get it directly from the Taylor family that it was worse in New York than it was in Aberdeen. The brethren don't know that either because I faced them up with it. And I remember praying in the prayer meeting because Irene was having a breakdown. Yes, she was having a breakdown because she couldn't get Kerr out of her bed. And she had to call in the family to drag her out and to stop it. New York was worse than Aberdeen.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5944s)

I have heard that the behaviour there, that there are multiple other accounts of similar behaviour.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5951s)

Yeah, in Irene's bed. That's why she was having a breakdown. Brethren never get told why she's having the breakdown. "Just pray for her." Yeah. Pretty serious what's happened in this pure line. Yeah. And the other thing that he was involved with, after withdrawing from people all around the world, he had shares in a worldly company, Chanel No. 5\. And I can remember him telling us, "Make sure you buy your wife Chanel No. 5 perfume." Why? Because he's making money out of it with his share of Chanel No. 5\.

And what proves this, and I've got the document, I think I mailed it to you from Diplock.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=5999s)

Okay, so I'm going to bring that up.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6000s)

Okay, that they saw in a perfume magazine an obituary for J.Taylor. And him and Tony Suckling, Lindy, you might know Tony Suckling, he read it too. And there was the obituary talking about JTJr. and his shares in the company and how well he had done. And they named his wife and his children. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6031s) there's no other James Taylor in the world that's got Irene as a wife and the same name children.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6037s)

So I'm going to read this out really quick. "Dear Neville, You asked about my recollections of the Chanel No. 5 aspect of Jim Taylor's ministry. It would have been in the very end of 1970 or maybe even '71 that we were at the home of a family in the EBs who at the time had received and believed the correspondence from the Aberdeen branch of the Brethren. This family, very shortly after this, capitulated to family pressure and are still in the Taylor-Hales group. I am sure they would not be into helping us now and would probably ever deny ever seeing it.

The [bulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6067s) of the correspondence had by then been received and perused, and then this couple received from overseas a page cut out of the English language version of a French journal of the cosmetics industry. I can picture it now, though I cannot remember all of it. 'Word has been received of the death of Mr. James Taylor Jr. of Brooklyn, New York. Mr. Taylor was one of the leading shareholders of Chanel.' More was said about this which I can't recall. It then added, 'He was also very active in his church. Mr. Taylor leaves his wife, Irene, [daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6098s) Florence, Mrs. James Wilson of Detroit, son Benjamin of Brooklyn, daughter Consuela, Mrs. Bruce Hales of Sydney, Australia, son James III of Brooklyn, daughter Estelle at home, and grandchildren.'

There was a closing paragraph which I cannot remember. Even after all the filth of the Aberdeen affair and its aftermath, this was an amazing piece of evidence that proved that we were not just dealing with an alcoholic old man, but a cunning and ruthless deceiver who had for 10 years preached this doctrine of separation, including this theory that being [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6128s) director or holding shares was an unequal yoke with unbelievers, which included withdrawing from those who did so and attempted to break up their families. I witnessed this in New York and New Jersey when I lived there. I also remembered hearing him suggest in at least one meeting, 'Why don't you buy your wife a bottle of Chanel No. 5?' I also remember that just before Aberdeen, when he was already in the south of England, he took a plane to Paris and disappeared for three or four days, much to the consternation of many. Could there be some connection here? Who knows, but I hope [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6158s) is all some help to you."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6160s)

And who's Gordon Diplock?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6161s)

Gordon Diplock was from over that way, and he married Arthur Suckling's daughter in Christchurch, and her sister is my auntie. So I know them quite well. And they lived in New York but came to New Zealand to see their family back out here. So I'd met them, and Gordon Diplock went out of the fellowship. Gordon was the son, sorry, the father was Alec Diplock, and his son was Gordon. And he came out [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6199s) then married after he came out to New Zealand and went out of fellowship. And we befriended Gordon after he was out of fellowship. I didn't know him when he was in fellowship, but I got to know him because he lived in Christchurch. He died a few years ago.

But there's a very interesting story in his family because his father, Alec, was a very close friend of JTJr. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6230s) when he saw the drink thing had got hold of JTJr., he went and saw him privately and had a private man-to-man, call-a-spade-a-spade talk about how it was wrecking JTJr. When he came home after that meeting, Alec Diplock was never ever Alec Diplock again. Something happened in that meeting. Gordon told me this with tears in his eyes. He said he came [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6260s), he was never their father again. He never ever cracked a joke again. He never ever smiled again. Something hit him or he was threatened in that meeting with something so bad that it completely changed him as a father, and he died without a smile on his face again.

So something very, very serious happened. But just to add a little bit more murkiness to that, I got in touch with Jimmy DeSeyn because I heard that some things had been said to him that just really crippled him and he almost wasn't the same man again. And I linked that with what I'd heard 15 years earlier with the Diplocks. So I rang DeSeyn and got on really well with him. I had probably half an hour or more on the phone with him, but the interesting thing was he wasn't telling me what they'd done or what they said or what really upset the apple cart. So I related [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6321s) had happened to Diplock.

Oh, yeah. I couldn't believe what happened on the phone. Jimmy DeSeyn just collapsed, and I could just hear the odd little gasp and a gasp of breath. And three times I had to ask him, "Are you still there, Jimmy?" I don't know how many minutes this went on for. I was going to hang up.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6346s)

He was obviously crying, yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6349s)

Yeah, yeah. And he came out of it, and I can't remember what he said to me exactly, but he said something like, "You hit the button." So I reckon he treated him as Taylor had treated Diplock and threatened them with death or a hitman or something if you open your mouth. Something that...

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6370s)

...really, really scarred him and terrified him.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6372s)

Correct. Emotionally had wrecked both those men. But there definitely could be a connection between the way those two men were handled, which was pretty serious stuff. I mean, we know they're in the mafia, so I quite expect they would do something like that. The other thing about the Taylor family, some people say, "Well, who do you think is the most responsible person for where the Exclusive Brethren are today?" I cannot [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6402s) past JT the Third.

Because I spoke, I spoke to JT the Third's sister-in-law, and she told me that when it erupted over Aberdeen and they had to decide whether Taylor was a pure man or a corrupt man, the person that was to sort it was JT the Third. I mean, why would you put a family member into a decision that's going to alter the course for 45,000 people? That's not even real for a start. [JT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6442s) the Third goes, he came back and he said, "My father is a pure man." And she said, "That broke the bank. That's what wrecked it." If he'd come back and said, "My father is a corrupt man," and he was dealt with, the pure line would have stopped fair there in 1970\.

But because he came back and said he's a pure man, this is what they've got today. So to my mind, JT the Third is the most responsible person alive for where the Exclusive Brethren are today because he could have stopped it right there if he told the truth, because he knew what had gone on in his own parents' home, not just Aberdeen. So you know, anybody listening from in there, how old was he, JT the Third? He came out and took meetings. He would have been, I would have thought, in his 30s, late 40s, I'm guessing.

But you know, anybody looking at the brethren from inside, you're being lied to. You've been conned. You need to look at these facts and make a decision on the facts, not on what the hierarchy want you to think. And you know, we really feel for you. It's a big move, but this thing can't continue. And here, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6537s) are the facts. You could be looking at it now rather than stumbling on, having to do what you're being told to do, which is not Christian what they're doing. We know that. That's why I mentioned some of these things, just hoping that somewhere the penny might drop. No way I can make all that up. This is real stuff.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6570s)

Carry on.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6571s)

Yeah, well, when you come to the priestly environment, you could have a whole podcast on this one. I mean, this is just, this is huge what's gone on. You gotta read his book. That's all I can say when it comes to the priestly visits. You gotta read the book. Yeah, I can't put it any better than that.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6597s)

Yeah, because in the book, to explain to the listener, you've given blow-by-blow accounts of the priests visiting you guys and how they handled you and things they said and all that kind of thing, right?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6607s)

Well, I've looked at the books that have been written, and they're all good. I'm not criticizing any of the books. But the books tended to focus on giving the book writer's point of view of what they thought of the brethren. I would rather the reader look at the facts and then come up with their own prediction of what they think the brethren are like. So that's why I gave it, "This is the question that we were [asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6638s), this is the answer I gave them, and read on till you see the result. Now, what do you think about that?" I'm not telling them. They are reading it. The reader's making up their mind whether it's kosher or not.

So that's why I wrote the middle of the book, main of the book was on that basis. I gave a bit of a reason for the first visit that we got from the person that I call the Himmler of the [Gestapo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6668s), and that was Terence Deck. And I'll name his name publicly. I don't mind that being named because he was the cruelest man I ever met. And he ran my assembly here with a rod of iron. He was never happy unless somebody was crying, that guy. And he was the guy that came and visited me. He only got one visit and he was out of it like a scared rabbit. He never ever came back again.

And I just told him, "I can see right up one end of you and out the other, and there's nothing in the middle." And it [sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6698s) of brought the priest visit to a pretty quick stop. That's what you said to him? Yep. Oh my gosh. And what turned, what battle-hardened me was not only my mother, the way they treated my widowed mother, but the way they treated an old crippled man who was crippled from the waist down on the night of his engagement. Yeah. And he treated him worse than you would treat an animal. And that old guy spoke to me out on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6728s) street in public, and he wept in public. He said, "Neville, you will never know how cruel the brethren are until you get shut up."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6737s)

Yeah, that is so true.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6740s)

It wasn't long, and I rang this Terence Deck up after what he did to that old man. And anybody touched Terence Deck is a bit like touching Bruce Hales. You touched him, you were out, you were gone. But I always work on the principle that you can always be a bigger bully than the bully, and you win. So I rang him up straight after I talked to that old man while I was still mad, and I rang him up and told him what I thought of him, what he'd done to the old man, and [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6770s) him straight. I said, "One more false step from you and I'll deal with you." And I just told him right where to get off.

And in his very professional voice, he said, "Neville, I think it's time that we investigated you." I said, "I've never heard anything more beautiful. I can't wait till you get here so I can get my hands on you and I'll deal with you." And I got away with it for 12 months. He never took that to the priestly circle or anything else. Every time I met him at a meeting, I just looked straight at him and he just looked straight at me, two alpha males not going to back down.

And then of course, he came on the first visit, which I hoped he would because I knew what I was going to do to him. He came on the first visit and he fell flat on his face for something that he said to me. The only time I've [ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6826s) felt sorry for a man so cruel. But he said something to me, but he didn't know I knew the facts underneath about something in the brethren that he didn't think I knew anything about. And it proved he wasn't telling the truth. And when I raised that with him and he just went deathly quiet, I thought, "Right, now is the time to send the scud missile." So I just turned on him, and boy, he couldn't get out of that room and get home. Never ever came back. He got other people to visit me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6853s)

And in his book, in your book, you tell the account of this old man is heart-wrenching, right?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6859s)

I do, because I love to give real-life experiences with what I say because a lot of people look at it and think, "Oh, that can't be true. That can't be true. That can't be true." So I took the time in the book, I know it could be boring, but I took the time in the book...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnhvYU5qgp2M%26t%3D6876s)

It was heart-wrenching. Yeah, it was told so beautifully. So everything that Neville's referring to here is all in the book. It's definitely something that you need to read.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6886s)

Just one story of many, right? Like...

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6889s)

Correct.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6890s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6892s)

We weren't hurt anywhere near as much as some people. I mean, I'm sitting in church this morning with an ex-EB sitting behind me who got brutalized. He lost all his children except one, lost his wife. He probably had faults like we've all got, but it didn't need to be. He was brutalized. You know, I turned around to him this morning because our case actually was mentioned in the church this morning, came completely out of the blue. And I thought, "Whatever are they talking about?"

And after the meeting, I turned around to him, this is just this morning, and I said, "You know, they gave Pip and I a bouquet, but you should have got the bouquet. You were more ill-treated than we were." Even though it took three years to go through it all, I didn't lose my wife, I didn't lose my children. Okay, I lost the money side of my business, but we recovered from that. So we never got abused like a lot of people, like the last people I had through the [sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6956s), eight children gone, half a million flogged off them. I mean, that's real rough stuff.

We were very fortunate with what we had to go through. But the book's an account of it. But some people have said to me, "Well, didn't you take a risk mentioning names?" I said, "No, because I sorted it out beforehand." "And well," they said, "how do you get permission to write people's names like that?" And it's gone around [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=6986s) world. Well, what I did was, it's quite easy to put the brethren between a rock and a hard place when it comes to contact with them because they don't want to have contact with you. So I wrote to the two people and I delivered it and put it in their letterbox.

And I wrote in it, "I'm writing an account of what happened during the time I was shut up and the time you abused me and you've told lies and all the rest of it. I'm going to put it into a book that people can read, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7016s) I'm going to put your names in there. So what you need to do now," because these priests, they're very good at making appointment times for me to bow down to them. So I thought, "Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander." So I said, "What you need to do now, you need to call me and make an appointment with me and come to my office and we'll sit down and we'll have a chat. And I'll show you what I'm going to write. And if you don't like it, I will take your name [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7047s)."

Well, of course, they're not going to come and see me. They hate me. "And I'll give you 14 days, or I'll take your absence as a yes, go ahead." So then I went and saw my lawyer and told him what I'd done. And he thought about it. He said, "That's the most unorthodox way I've ever heard of doing this." And then just sat back, roared his head off, but he said, "You've covered yourself." Wow, I love that.

And then I tried it with Bruce Hales and I tried it with Alan Davis. I wanted to write to them, and they knew I was on their tail, like the postcards to Bruce Hales, but I've been threatened to be sued. I wanted them to receive mail like my priests. I registered the mail, which means it's signed for when they take it at the other end. So you know that they've accepted it. Because normally, if I wrote to somebody who hated me in there and they saw my name on the return address, they'd say, "No, I'm not signing that," and they wouldn't take it, and the postman would have to take it back and send it back to me.

So on Alan Davis's, because he's [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7124s) the meat trade, he processes meats like venison and beef and pork and all the rest of it, on the back of it, I put, "Top Grade Venison Supplies," which I do because people shoot venison on my property and I supply it. So that was my return address, which was absolutely true. And of course, when he read that, he thought, "Oh, this is somebody wants to do business with me. I can make some money out of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7154s) guy." So he signs the chit to say he had received it. So I did the same to Bruce Hales about office furniture, and he signed it too. So I got a letter into their hands without them knowing that it was my letter. And then I could say in the letter, "Well, now you've read the letter, you can't say that I never told you the truth and never told you what was happening." So it worked really well on Bruce Hales and Alan [Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7184s) as well. So that's how I have the legal right to actually have those names printed in there.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7191s)

Yeah.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7192s)

But that's how you do it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7193s)

One of the things in your book, Neville, that is so, I remember reading it and it just cracked me up, was your account of when the doctrine was brought in that the men had to kiss each other in the assembly.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7207s)

I can still feel it.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7210s)

Should I read some of it out just for some light relief? Because honestly, your account is so, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7216s)

I think you should.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7217s)

Okay, I'll just bring it up. So yeah, just again for the listener, Neville and Pip wrote this book called *Cast Outside the Camp*, which is obviously a scriptural reference to being cast outside the camp. And but yeah, there's this account in there of when, yeah, what year was it? 1968, actually, you've got here. So it's, I'm reading from *Cast Outside the Camp*, page 64, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7247s) Neville has given this account which is titled, "The Daily Slobbery Masculine Holy Kiss." And I won't read it all, but I'll read some of it.

And you've written, "I cannot write about this odd behavior without a shudder from head to foot. This order was given by JTJr., 1968 approximately, and no male was exempt. From memory, every man kissed every other man every day for far [too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7277s) long, maybe for a year or two. Once again, Scripture was adulterated to accommodate the dictates of the leaders. A holy kiss? If all things holy are as pleasant as this experience was, then I might just choose all things unholy.

No directions were given for the physical execution of this intimate performance, so we did what all people do when left in the dark, which is work it out for yourself. With all the bony noses, wet noses, slobbery lips, and hairy ears that smacked me in the face every day, I for one learned super quick how to duck, roll, lean, and sometimes clean just to save my face being messed up for the following meeting. When you're faced with 30 or 40 oncoming male lips desperate to please the Führer, the German leader, it is amazing how enthusiastic these lips can [become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7325s) and how different they all seem to be. After 40 years, I can still remember who had little fine line tight lips, normally of the skinny indoor type person. Being kissed by those lips is like being kissed by an oyster shell. The swollen fat lips of those who were overfed came at you as if they were looking for something more to eat."

Oh man, and you go on. "There was one brother whose jaw, just before the kiss, seemed to go to a spasm of chompings on nothing but fresh air. This act would produce a quantity of white foam in each corner of his mouth, which protruded out level with his cheeks, just ready to be plastered along the side of my face with any extra foam embedding itself in my ear hole as he passed by." And oh my gosh, it goes on for like several pages, but it's, I just, yeah, you've got a hilarious sense of humor there, Neville. And oh [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7376s) gosh, it's the funniest account.

So I'm just scrolling down and I've noticed that you also dissect what different people did with their feet and their legs as they navigated themselves trying to get lined up for the approach. And those who are alcoholics, "By the time a non-whisky drinker had been kissed by a number of alcoholics, we were bordering on intoxication also."

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7400s)

Yeah, I felt drunk after I'd be kissed by half a dozen of them. There is one error in there which I'll put out, where I've said "every meeting," it should have been "every breaking of bread."

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7416s)

Oh, was it, was it done at the Lord's Supper, I think?

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7420s)

I think it was only done at the Lord's Supper. I think that's right, yeah.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7426s)

No way. Oh my gosh, I've never heard that. That is super peculiar.

### [**Neville McCallum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7430s)

Yeah, somebody else might be able to tell you it accurately, but I just didn't want to put every meeting if it wasn't, that's all.

### [**Lindy Jacomb**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvYU5qgp2M&t=7438s)

Yeah, yeah. No, that's, oh gosh, that's really interesting. Like just these little slices of history, right, of yeah, things that were not in our day, but oh yeah, you've got a great account there. Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
