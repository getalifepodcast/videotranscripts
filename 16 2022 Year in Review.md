## Summary

Join Cheryl, Carman and Richard on New Year's Eve as they take us through the antics of the PBCC of 2022. We review from the beginning of the year how this Mainstream Christian Church is anything but MAINSTREAM. All links to the articles are listed below so you can keep up with why we are fighting so hard for this to be exposed. In less than 2 hours, you will be astonished this group can even legally consider them a Christian Church and hold a charitable status. Richard even pulled out the JND Bible to show viewers how Stephen Harper's was actually a PBCC bible. He lets us in on the conversation that was had when he was inside regarding the gifting of this Bible to Stephen Harper.
*Added in here is the article of Dr McPhillips that we missed in our podcast.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=12s)

Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. And Happy New Year. We are back today with Richard and Carman and myself. And we are going to take you through our year in review of what all went through the PBCC, what hit the headlines, and kind of catch everyone up to date with all the antics that happened, because there was a lot that happened this year. And it's hard to keep up with it all. It's hard to keep [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=42s) with all the podcasts and all the news articles that were being written. So we're gonna take you through from the beginning of the year to now on everything that has happened.

So we're going to start it off with really what pretty much started everything. So we're just gonna get this up.

All right, can you guys see that?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=67s)

Yep. Yep.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=69s)

So I wanted to show everybody, even though we have, so we've got James DiFiore Blackballed, we've got, I mean, so many different podcasts, we've got the Get-A-Life podcast. We have, Richard has collaborated and compiled all of the podcasts, every podcast that has been done on all the different sources on something called PBCC podcasts. So for those of you that were looking and wanting to find a place where everything is in one place, this is where you [need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=100s) to go and get it all. So it's got everybody's on here including Canadaland’s, Carman Studer's, Blackballed, the Veracity Breaking Brethren documentary, there's everything's on here. So we're going to start off with what really set everything in motion in Canada was David Wallace's audio recording of him trying to figure out who the [PBCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=130s) were when he had first been hired to kidnap Richard. So we're going to go to that first.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=192s)

“And it's very strange these guys picked me out of a hat. And they're throwing me obscene. I mean nobody pays 10 G's a week to chase down a guy to serve papers. Yep, yep.

They sent me an email and they told me that I can look at this guy before I do anything or call on a sheriff. They want me to see if I can stake the place out, confiscate his laptop, and then call in this number. They said they've got a team. So I'm thinking to myself, what have I gotten myself into here? You know these are not formal people and I'm doing all this research and it leads back to these wacko religious freaks.

And these people out of Vancouver, it doesn't make any sense. And there's heavy money behind these guys.

**Dr Kirat Singh**

So how does this guy Mitchell fit in? 

**David Wallace**

This is my contact. His name is Brad Mitchell, and he's been calling me and every time he gets on the phone he puts me on pause and he's calling out he's got some English guy on the phone…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=257s)

So I'm going to read some of this. Brad Mitchell of Vancouver, Canada owns Klondike Lubricants and is also a manager. Oh, it went too fast. Just for those people who are listening are going to be able to see this.

### [**David Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=268s)

“He's got another guy on the phone and they're asking me all these questions.   
Okay, do you think he's in Toronto? 

Listen, I don't give a shit, because if he's here he ought to run because these guys are fanning out so wherever he is get them, gotta dodge, get out of dodge. Is there any way, what do these people want from him? 

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=287)

Well, I know that they were looking for him because he was excommunicated and making a nuisance of himself to the church.

**David Wallace**

It's gotta be more than that. Not for this kind of money. Gotta be more than that.

**Dr Kirat Singh**

I don't know then. I don't know anything further than that.

**David Wallace**

They're telling me they had people following his wife on a bus, and they had people sent out to you and offering to fly you out to places, and I'm thinking, none of this adds up\! None of this adds up\! I mean, am I going to be able to shake these people?

I mean...I've got a feeling and...I mean, this is just not a good vibe.None of this is adding up, it has got to be more than just this guy making fun of people or pissing people off.

I mean, I'm not getting it. How big are these people? 

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=331)

The church? It's not a huge church, but very rich apparently. I mean, I don't know very much.

**David Wallace**

There's got to be a way to get it. So since you spoke to me the other day, they've been contacting you again? Yeah, they're telling me that I've been engaged for the job that I took to deposit and I have to finish it. I'm not finishing a job with these people. I told them I'm giving their money but I don't want nothing to do with it.

What they're basically asking me to do is illegal. 

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=363)

Oh yeah, there's lots of things that they would do that is illegal.

**David Wallace**

 But it's more than just illegal, they're talking about, I mean they're talking about kidnapping.

**Dr Kirat Singh**

Are they specifically explicitly using that word? 

**David Wallace**

Not that word but they sure as hell danced around it and they're offering all kinds of dough on top of it. So, I mean look, I don't understand but they got all this guy's medical documentation, they got everything. They got everything on this guy's life, stuff that's supposed to be sealed. That's heavy duty.

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=398)

I mean how much are they offering you if…?

**David Wallace**

They said I got a blank checkbook to find this guy and they told me if I could find him within a month they'll give me a $150,000 bonus. That's insane for a guy who's a nuisance that don't add up. They want more from this guy. He must have the goods on them and something fierce.

Why doesn't he go to law enforcement  or something? There's got to be somewhere he can go. I mean, I got access to a few different databases that he doesn’t, but I'll tell you one thing. I ain't telling these guys nothing because I don't want my name tied to this guy who's missing. I don't, I know it sounds good, I'm sure I have to stop, but look, these people are giving me the big time creeps.

Big time creeps. And they're having people reach out to me that are way too big up the chain. You know, they try to change my mind. I don't need to be taking calls from people in Alberta who sit in the Premier's office. 

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=459)

So who's this Alan Hallman? Can you remind me? Who was that? 

**David Wallace**

This Hallman guy was a political organizer for Premier.

**Dr Kirat Singh**

 Kenny. 

**David Wallace**

…but there’s something going on here, man…

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=505)

So they gave you, they gave you a check? 

**David Wallace**

No, they don’t give me no check. They're sending me Interac transfers, five grand at a time from a place called Klondike Fuels and another place called Tillsonburg Tube. Yeah, there's two different…they're sending me from their businesses. Like clockwork every Sunday it  comes in. I want to give their money back. I don't want to do this.

Like this is too heavy for me. I don't do this sort of stuff, but that's not what this is about. These guys are hunting this guy. He’s gotta run, he's gotta go, he's got to get the hell away from here. If he’s in Ontario, get the hell out of Ontario, go anywhere but. Pick a province on a map with a dart.

I don't care. I don't care if it comes through a letter. I just need to know about these people. Who the hell are they? And if he's ever heard of this guy named Brad Mitchell. ‘Cause that guy is really giving me the creeps. 

[**Dr Kirat Singh**](https://youtu.be/C_3FAF0i_WE?t=590)

What specifically is he saying to you about…?

**David Wallace**

 Its *how* he said. The guy, I thought these were religious people. This guy is talking about his wife you see, I'll give you an example. This is not my words, okay? I'm going to give you verbatim, okay? He's telling me she’s a coon, and then he's making remarks on about [jews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=605s) and he's making remarks about, he said this guy's a Paki. This is how he talks. This guy's supposed to be religious?

**Dr Kirat Singh**

No, no, no, no. Nothing religious about it.

**David Wallace**

I'm dead. You know I'm dumping these guy's calls and, and I don't want the same treatment from these religious loonies coming by my place of business, shit, I don't need that stuff. Just be careful. 

**Dr Kirat Singh**

Oh, thanks, thanks for your…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=749s)

What is that? How does that feel, Richard, after watching that? I'm sure it's probably been a while since you've watched it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=757s)

Yeah, it is. Yeah, no, it is. You do get kind of accustomed to the idea of being a wanted man, but it is a little shocking when you hear it over again. And I mean, the thing is, David had no idea he was being recorded. So this is, you know, nothing he's saying is for the camera. This is like 100%.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=776s)

You can tell how genuinely, authentically scared he is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=780s)

Yeah. I mean, he was very upset when he found it. He had been recorded and he was pleading with me to take it down. But yeah, it's authentic. And, you know, I mean, this isn't the first time the brethren have hired private investigators and the private investigator has been so horrified at what he's being asked to do that he's actually contacted the other side to warn them. I mean, this is not the first time. This is what they do. And private investigators, like they operate at the roughest end of the business. The people are not easily shocked, but this mainstream Christian church seems to seems to shake them up pretty bad. [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=823s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=823s)

And for those that were listening and not watching, there's a lot of commentary that's written into that video and there's another video on there that's a longer version of the whole recording.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=837s)

So we can put links to the videos, can't we? Yeah, I'll make sure they're available.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=841s)

Exactly. Yeah. Okay, let's head on. We've got that was kind of the very, very beginning of the year. I think that was February, wasn't it? Okay, let's just, I gotta go back to here. Oh, bear with me y'all. How do I get out of here? Let's go figure out how to get out of here. Here we go. Okay, so yeah, just going back to that. So just so you know that there is, there's lots of, every video that we have done is all on that PBCC podcast list. So you just gotta google PBCC podcast. Okay, so we are going to head into, I'm gonna let you, Richard, talk about this one. I didn't, this is something you had sent me. I didn't catch this one.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=908s)

Yeah so the most remarkable thing about 2022 from the Brethren perspective is they actually managed to stay out of the headlines for the whole of January, which is pretty remarkable given their following record. So I'm just kind of assuming that they have some kind of vacation from doing shit in January. We'll see if it's repeated this year. But they sure made up for it for the rest of the year. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=938s) right at the beginning of February, Nick Smith, who's a member of parliament for a Welsh constituency, was asking questions in the House of Commons.

Private Eye, which is a kind of a UK investigative journalism magazine, has uncovered £600 million of PPE contracts awarded to Unispace Global, who we all know as Gareth and Charles Hales. The department has paid the money to Unispace, but it's not shown on the company accounts. Nothing happening here. Will the minister strain every sinew and will there be an investigation to account for the £600 million of public money? This is taxpayer money.

And Nick Smith, make it clear, he's in the opposition is a Labour Party. The crooked Conservatives are still clinging on to power just because they're not due for an election yet. And so, yeah, this kicks off the year quite nicely with the whole Unispace, Hales-led, PBCC, PPE contract scandal coming unraveled. And it's still unraveling in spectacular ways and this will get increasing news through the next year. This is a gift that keeps on giving. So yeah, that's all I want to say on that one. So that's February. Yeah, so what do we have next? I don't know what this is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1034s)

Let's get rid of this. I'm not sure what this is. Yeah, that'd be something. Okay, so now this gets us into right into the beginning of...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1047s)

Oh, yeah, this one's a little out of order, but in any case, this is... Oh, yeah, this is July. This is July, but let's see you've got it up. Let's talk about it. So this is the Dean Blundell Network, which is a kind of a podcasting network, which James DiFiore is part of. And this is an article, July 2022, basically talking about Stephen Harper's connection to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, and therefore by implication, Pierre Poilievre who's the leader of the opposition. Poilievre was in Harper's office as a very close aide through the entire time that Harper was Prime Minister and the entire time that he was receiving gifts and support extensively from [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1101s) PBCC. So Poilievre knows all about the PBCC. He has no doubt on first name terms with their big cheeses. And so this is just a little expose of this. And again, all sorts of more stuff is going to come out. And oh yeah, just scroll back up again. This is a very interesting point. This is a photo from Stephen Harper's [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1131s) he was sworn in as a prime minister. And of course, they're sworn in on the Bible.

And Stephen Harper brought his own Bible to the ceremony, which is very unusual. And when I was in the Brethren, I was in the Brethren at the time this happened, I was in Regina, and Don Gregg, who was a kind of a prominent brother in Regina, who was the political, he was their kind of political agent, he dealt with the, he was kind of in control of the, ran the anti-gay marriage campaign, which just preceded Harper's inauguration. Don Gregg calls me into his office and shows me a full-size sort of 8x12 glossy photo print of which this image is just a small portion of Harper being sworn in and Don Gregg was looking incredibly smug, which is something he was kind of good at, and he says, 

“Look, Stephen Harper brought the Bible we gave him to his inauguration, he was sworn in on a JN Darby Bible that the brethren gifted to him\!”

And I mean this was like stunning news for the [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1203s) because it meant yes I mean the guy is you know it's kind of a coded message from Stephen Harper to the whole brethren congregation yes I'm on your side I'm doing your thing. 

So when I left, or quite recently, several years after I left, I dug into this and found this photo online and ordered, in fact, a good friend of mine, Guy Wilson from the UK, [ordered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1234s) from the Bible and Gospel Trust the identical version and binding of JND Bible that they'd gifted to Harper, which is kind of the large size semi-yap binding. They've got about five different bindings and sizes of JND Bible they do. And so he ordered it and sent it to me. And sure enough, you can match it up exactly. You can just see on this photo, just in the space under [Harper's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1265s) thumb, you can see the gold embossing, and that actually says Stephen Harper. And that gold embossing is in exactly the same size and position as the gold embossing on every Plymouth Brethren Bible where they'll put your initials on it. And also just under his thumb, you can see a little dark line, like a quarter inch wide margin around the cover. There's an embossed dark line.

And this is distinctive to Bible and Gospel Trust Bibles, that they have this line embossed in the margin around the cover. And sure enough, having received, actually, hold a moment, I've got it here. Hold a second.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1302s)

As I say, I think this is really good to point this out while Richard goes to get this, is that, you know, I get questioned, like, why we pin Pierre onto anything to do with the PBCC, because it hasn't really been vocal about it. And I mean, anybody who is in the hands of the Kenny administration, that Stephen Harper, I mean, so many people realize how much Stephen Harper is still pulling the strings behind the scenes. So it's just, I really want people to listen [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1335s) on this and realize that across the globe worldwide, they lean towards these right wing conservative political parties because their beliefs line up. And so it's super important for people to realize that we don't sit there and just pin stuff on Harker or anybody in Kenny's cabinet that had anything to do with Richard‘s stuff or Pierre Poilievre because we know they all group together. They're all in on it. They all sit at the same table discussing this stuff.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1366s)

Yeah. So here is, here's in like original packaging from the Bible and Gospel Trust sent originally to Guy Wilson in the UK and then sent on to me. This is the identical Bible to the one that Stephen Harper is holding there.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1386s)

Hang on a second. I've got to stop share so everybody can see that. Yeah, go ahead. Okay.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1391s)

Yeah. So open this box, and here is the identical Bible that Stephen Harper is holding. And you can see that quarter-inch margin around the edge, and you can see GRW, that's Guy Wilson's initials, and that's in exactly the same position and size as on Harper's Bible, it says Stephen Harper. Now for brethren members they won't put your full name on, its initials only but obviously when they made this gift to Stephen Harper they put his full name on it and and you can hold this you can see that it drapes, it's got the pink and the gold and it sort of droops open in exactly the same way as Stephen Harper was holding it for his inauguration. It's the identical Bible.

Now, if Stephen Harper had been inaugurated and was sworn in on the Quran, or maybe one of the Scientology books, can you imagine what a riot that would have caused? And yet he's sworn in on the Bible that's specific to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, this incredibly damaging cult, and no one has raised an eyebrow. But you will be hearing more about Stephen Harper and his Bible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1471s)

Yeah, we're just we're just touching on all of this right now. Give me little glimpses. Okay, let's go back there. Yeah, and I mean, if we go continue down, I can't believe I have this out of order, but that's okay. If you continue down on this article, it goes into, I mean, a lot of people have seen and heard of that same video of the five PBCC members at Stephen Harper's inauguration. It was, here's a picture of it. Chuck Truan, Roy Taylor, Brad Mitchell, Ron Barnes and Ralph Mooney. Yeah. So yeah. Okay, let's see if we can get back on to...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1511s)

But members of the PBCC, they don't have anything to do with politics.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1514s)

Nothing, no. No, no, they don't have anything to do with politics.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1517s)

It's just a mainstream church. Okay, so this is back to February. So this is February the 5th, so they managed to go nearly 24 hours without a scandal. And then this is billions in COVID deals given to firms linked to the Plymouth Brethren sect. And yeah, so the whole thing is unraveling. You can't go much further on this because it's behind a paywall. Oh no, have got someone here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1544s)

I went and subscribed to it last night. Oh well done, well done. Okay. So yeah;

“Firms with links the insular (understatement) Plymouth Brethren, have been handed contracts for PPE etc without other companies being given a chance to bid for the contracts. The evangelical group…(Well I mean that's not true)...they likened to a cult… (well they are a cult)... has connections with the Conservative Party. (Well, that's an understatement.)...and MPs have previously lobbied for it to be given charitable status.”(Well, that kind of worked.)

 But yes, I mean, this is, and there were a whole series of these articles, but the Times, the Times is, you know, I don't know how far its fame extends beyond the UK, but I mean, it's the newspaper, it's the [oldest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1597s) newspaper in Britain, and by far the most respectable. When the Times publishes something, you can take that to the bank.

This is a whole lot about Unispace Global, and they're talking about 680 million. Well, that number kept growing through the year because they found that Unispace Global had used a bunch of brethren front companies. And so it goes up and up. Here's a notable point. Unispace Global recorded an 86 million pounds profit, so that's at least $100 million, $120 million in 2020, with the largest beneficiary likely to be Gareth Hales entitled to £32 million. So that weekender house he bought for just $10 million Australian dollars, that was just pocket change for him. I mean, he's got far, far more cash than he knows what to do with. It's interesting to note that that 32 million that Gareth has in his back [pocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1660s) is actually more or less the same sum of money that the latest GFT fundraising appeal is trying to squeeze out of the poor saints in North America.

And where do you even start to talk about it? All the money that the Hales’s are using these business seminars and GFT fundraising appeals and Campus\&Co to raise, they have many times that just floating around in their bank accounts. They don't even have enough to spend it on. I mean, Gareth has now got two houses. I mean, is he going to get one for every day of the week? He could do and still have change. They don't need your money. [You're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1705s) in there at the moment. And you know, I pity you, let me give you one piece of advice. Do not give a fucking penny to these wealthy assholes. They've got far more money than they need. They could finance the entire OneSchool Global out of their pocket change. Don't give them another dime. You've got better things to do with your money. You worked hard to earn it, keep it, spend it on your family, spend it on something sensible, give it to a real charity.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1732s)

And you know, and we're really finding that out right now through, I mean our moles grow by the hundreds in a day, right? We have so many people that are coming out of the woodwork and giving us...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1746s)

So we breed moles. Yeah, we breed them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1747s)

Yeah. There's so many. I mean, Bruce, you won't even, you're not going to be able to pinpoint these seriously. Like they're coming out of the woodworks left, right and center. But the common theme that is coming from all these people from the inside is the how blatant the hierarchy is in there with those that have money and those that don't. And those that have money get to get away with whatever they want to do. But yet if somebody went and did the exact same thing that somebody didn't have money with it...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1777s)

Yeah, they get clobbered. Yeah, yeah. And the other thing that really strikes me about this whole, I mean the brethren, the Hales’s, the majority globally, the majority of the very lucrative PPE contracts went to companies owned by or partially owned by the Hales family. They probably cleared a cool one to two billion dollars in net profit out of the whole thing. Now they could [actually,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1807s) I mean, just kind of think about the way a church should operate and how the leadership should operate. If the leadership of a church gets some massive financial windfall, wouldn't you expect them to share it with the flock a little?

Have we seen that happening? I mean, just out of the whole PPE windfall, which was done, they could only have done that with the help of thousands of brethren globally. I mean, they leveraged the whole brethren system in order to secure all these contracts, they needed the brethren and they used the brethren, hundreds of thousands of man-hours of brethren time to get these contracts. Don't you think they could hand back a little to the flock? I mean, they could [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1853s) give every man, woman and child in the PBCC several thousand dollars just as a gift out of the profits they have made on the PPE contracts. Wouldn't that be a nice Christian thing to do? Kind of Christmas bonus for the saints. But no, what do they come out with at Christmas and New Year? New fundraisers, more money. You know, we need more money. Bring me your cash. We're crying out for money.

It's blatant and it's disgusting. And it just shows the level of brainwashing that these people have been subjected to. They can't see that the money is flowing from the poor to the rich. And Bruce Hales, you know, they've got this lovely recording of Bruce Hales they put out talking about the half of my goods I give to the poor. Yeah, like hell are you doing that, Bruce? If you did that, you'll be handing a [multi-thousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1914s) dollar bonus to every single one of those 55,000 brethren. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1919s)

Yeah. Yeah. Listen to this. I have to read this. 

“The founder of the Good Law Project said, it's very, very odd that companies connected to a tiny sect have won £2.2 billion worth of contracts. At best, it's a head-scratcher. A spokesman for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church said, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is a place of love and worship, not of business and politics.

Like in any other religious group of church, many of our members run their own businesses and these businesses are completely separate from the church. Any contractual agreements between the government and these independent businesses are completely unrelated to our church.”

which we now know, I mean, we knew this as ex-members that this is a bunch of bullshit, but I mean the recordings that we get from even just inside the brethren meetings, we know that this is so untrue. It's so false. Yeah. [Yeah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1980s) Okay. We have lots to get through here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=1983s)

We've got a lot of months to go yet. We've already started the year. Okay. So this is an interesting little one. This is an odd one. This is from Northern Ireland. And this was the brethren trying to get government funding for their school in Northern Ireland. And it's a little bit of a complicated case, but basically what the Brethren were trying to say is that this big OneSchool Global campus they were going to provide or build would be open to pupils from outside the cult.

Because obviously if the school is purely for cult members, and it's not going to be eligible for government funding. So they tried to make out that, oh, yes, we would welcome, you know, well-disposed pupils that are not members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which, of course, is a complete lie. I think there may have been one or two cases. I think there was one case where the principal of a Brethren school sent his kid to the school, and I have no doubt he was paid and induced to do that just for the same reason, to make it look as if it's not just a cult school. But the government saw through it, government of Northern Ireland saw through it and rejected it. So that's kind of the back story [there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2073s) Because of course, yes, they would have made some token attempt, they would have said it's open to other students, but firstly no one in their right mind who's not in the Brethren would send their kids to a brethren school and secondly if anyone did apply they would find some reason or other why for some reason it couldn't work so yeah it's just their lying and their desperate attempt to get government funding.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2099s)

I do want to say this, I just want to point this out because this is super important. OneSchool Global educates around 10,000 pupils in 20 countries around the world but 23 currently operating across the UK. Parents of pupils currently pay fees of between £3,295 and £10,000 a year, depending on how many children they enroll. So I want people to understand that when they do all this fundraising for OneSchool Global, and it's like it's for the schools, for the schools, for the school, every child still has to pay a fee for that, for going to school for that year. It's not a free, it's not a free school, you've got to pay to go there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2137s)

Yeah, now when I was in the Brethren and my children were going to the one school in Cambridge, we were all told the fee structure, it's so many thousand for the first child, so many thousand for the second child. This was conveyed to us verbally or by telephone at the least, never put in writing, and we were told that Bruce Hales says it's mandatory, and it was made clear to us that you're not going to get an invoice or anything in writing about this. And we later found [out,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2167s) I mean it was kind of obvious at the time, we later found out that they were telling the government that attendance was free for the students and any donation the parents made to the school was voluntary. And then this all got caught up in a big tax scandal and the brethren sort of stitched up a deal with inland revenue so it was all hushed up. But yeah, they were literally telling the parents that this is the fees and it's mandatory and out of the other corner of their mouth telling the government that it was free [education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2198s) they were offering to the students. So yeah, they're just such accomplished and glib liars. It's shocking.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2206s)

Okay, so this is something that really broke it for me. After hearing the audio and stuff of...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2215s)

Do you know what date this is? This is sequential, isn't it? This is like probably March, is it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2222s)

Yeah. March 27th. Yeah, March. March 27th. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2228s)

Yeah. So, wow, kind of a week later then we have Veracity starts to hit the headline. So this is just one of their preliminary kind of promotional videos. And of course, Veracity, the whole Veracity thing came out of David Wallace. Well, what actually happened here was that Alex McIntosh, who was one of the Veracity producers and they do all kinds of documentaries, was looking for a new subject for his next documentary and [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2258s) headline caught his eye about a school crossing guard, the guy that holds up the stop sign in Abbotsford, British Columbia, who had applied to not pay union dues, because apparently in British Columbia, if you're crossing guard, you have to be a member of the union. 

He applied on the grounds of Christian conscience not to pay union dues so that he could continue his work as a crossing guard, and no doubt [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2288s) was for one of the Brethren schools there. So this caught Alex’s eye, he thought, well, this is really weird. And so he starts googling Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, comes up with a video of David Wallace's phone call, which we started out with. And of course, that got him really excited. And then he contacts me. And so this eventually ended up in the Veracity Breaking Brethren documentary, which kind of shows how stupid the Brethren [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2318s) to... I mean, as if they really have a conscience about paying Union dues to be a crossing guard. Think of all the other illegal shit that they were doing in British Columbia at the same time. And they make this pious little appeal to the government because it's against their conscience, which of course was chucked out. And it actually was the trigger for pretty much everything that's happened since. And this is a gift that keeps on giving. But yeah, this is [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2349s) an introductory spiel. So that was March this year.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2356s)

And I mean, you'll find the whole full documentaries on our, is on the PBCC podcast link in YouTube.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2362s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2364s)

Okay. So this is March 3rd.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2365s)

Okay. So this is a funny one because this is actually from the archives, Sydney Morning Herald, which is, is, is the newspaper Michael Bachelard works for, and the brethren greatly antagonized the Sydney Morning Herald by taking a whole load of, you know, court cases against them that were purely SLAPP tactics and you know cost them a whole lot of money.

But the Sydney Morning Herald does kind of flashbacks to you know what happened on this [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2396s) 30 years ago or 50 years ago so this is from the archives of 1962\.

 “Ex-adherents say the sect breaks homes”

 Which and you know there was a whole article about it in the Sydney Morning Herald and it just shows that none of this is new. They've been doing this for 60, 70 years. And in fact, I mean, it got a lot worse in the 1960s, but in fact, broken families due to brethren extremism go right back to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2426s) days of J.N. Darby. There's newspaper articles from the 1860s about families being broken up by disagreements over brethren doctrine ideology so this goes way way back.

Okay so this is an interesting one. I mean in New Zealand they got this kind of extreme commune which is a little like the Hutterites. It's you know, pseudo-Christian community that actually practices isolation in the sense of living on a commune rather than among regular people. And unsurprisingly, it turns out that the leadership in this commune had been sexually abusing minors and the members had to do an enormous amount of labor at way below minimum wage or actually volunteer labor.

So this all, some members escaped, this all hit the fan. They set up a royal commission inquiry and then they extended that inquiry to include other closed community faiths, exclusive brethren recently known as Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. So that inquiry, I don't know whether it's completed yet, but it shows an intelligent move on the part of the New Zealand [government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2516s) to realize that you know what happens in one one of these high control communities is going to be happening in others so that's that's an ongoing story and that's May so we've actually got to May and you know only about 10 scandals so far so not too bad. I mean this is just oh this is May as well.

Yeah, so this is Emily Leedham, a very good investigative reporter with Press Progress, contacted me. And in fact, she was working on this before everything else blew up, but I fed her some extra material. And yeah, so this was the brethren in Canada, suddenly managed to donate $40,000 to a PAC, as they call it, which is a political advocacy committee or something, basically a political pressure group. They donated $40,000, and it was about 10 or 15 individuals. I think it was more, actually, than they say.

This money was used to put up some very nasty anti-Trudeau attack ads on billboards in cities across Canada, and also a full front page on top of the cover ad on one of the national papers, National Post. Time for a new Prime Minister. The interesting thing here is that the money from all these different individuals was donated over a time span of only 48 hours. Now the Brethren claim there's no central organization and that any political activity is purely the individual conscience of members. If they decide to donate to some political campaign, that's just their [own,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2636s) you know, it just popped into their head that morning that suddenly we're going to donate $10,000 to some obscure political action committee. The fact that this was all donated over a time span of 48 hours shows, proves conclusively that this was centrally organized. An instruction went out and I've no doubt it came from Sydney, Australia.

Yes, we need to donate money to this, get everyone rounded up and get everyone who can to throw cash at this cause.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2666s)

And I mean, the thing is, I hate making this about the political, the left versus right, because it's not about that. This is about a cult that don't, they don't vote. They are not supposed to take part in anything political because they truly believe that god is the highest court and their religion is the highest court, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2688s)

Don't believe in democracy at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2690s)

Yeah, no they don't, right? I mean if you really got inside there and realized just how structured they are and then all of a sudden they because they're so politically tied in that I don't have an issue of people doing this kind of stuff. I have an issue with the PBCC doing this stuff, right? Yeah, that's my issue. I want to make that clear that I don't have an issue with people campaigning against other leaders. I don't have an issue with that. I mean that's your, that's your political right. I have an issue with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church doing it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2719s)

Yeah, go and do it at the voting, at the poll booth. The reason they don't like Trudeau is that he displaced Harper and the conservatives, and they owned the conservatives. Harper would do anything they wanted. He was in their hand. And then Trudeau comes in. They got no hold on Trudeau. And it emerged that they've been doing all sorts of nasty work behind the scenes to try and dig up dirt on Trudeau, including [blowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2750s) a completely fake story, contriving and publishing with the help of conservative operatives, a completely fake story that Justin Trudeau had had some kind of sexual relations with a student when he was a teacher at a school in British Columbia. And Brad Mitchell actually bragged to Nathan Jacobson and David Wallace that they were behind that story, which shows how low they will stoop. I mean, that's astonishingly dirty [work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2781s) for a company of people that claim to represent Christ on Earth, isn't it? You might expect it from a political operative, but you don't expect it from a church, and particularly one that believes it is the church. Yeah. Okay. Wow, it's a long year, isn't it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2802s)

It is, I know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2804s)

So what data we got to here? This is still May. May 18th. So this is classic, and this is just the UK PPE scandal just repeating itself, carbon copied and pasted all around the globe. Doug Ford, right wing conservative government in Ontario, gave an oil company, an oil company run by members of secretive religious sects, millions of dollars for face masks. So for some reason, instead of buying face masks from a PPE supplier, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2842s) decide to go to Klondike lubricants run by Brad Mitchell, who we've heard of before, and give him millions of dollars for face masks.

So, you know, that kind of stinks. Yeah, Klondike lubricants receive $1.94 million in public funds, that's the taxes that you and I pay, presumably in return for some kind of quid pro quo or assistance and help in the political arena. I mean, why else would they do that? Why would they go all the way to Vancouver to an oil company to buy their face masks? Yeah. It's still only the springtime, you know, the snow's starting to melt.

Okay, wow, we've got to June, although I think possibly we missed one or two. So okay, now when Press Progress keep digging into this story through the year, they then find 50 million, $50 million COVID contracts in Manitoba. And guess what? It's a conservative government in Manitoba. So, you know, same story, different province. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2928s) know, it just keeps going. And credit here to Damian Hastie who's actually taken on the mammoth task of digging not only through the UK COVID contracts, but it's actually adding up the Brethren-related COVID contacts globally, and it's a staggering figure. So watch this space.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2948s)

You know, I just gotta dive into this just for something.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2953s)

Yeah, go for it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2955s)

Yeah. I'm going back to the Breaking Brethren documentary. This is in this article. The PBCC were the subject of a recent CTV news documentary that brought to light disturbing allegations from former members detailing how they were cut off from friends and families under the PBCC's doctrine of separation. The PBCC dispute these claims and denies it's a cult. In a previous statement to press progress the PBCC explained we are not secretive but we are often misunderstood.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2983s)

I mean, let's have an audit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=2991s)

Yeah, yeah, they're misunderstood. My heart bleeds for them really. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3000s)

Okay, this is June still, June 17th. This is where we get into the Klondike papers. And I mean, up until this point on Twitter, the Klondike papers went viral, right? And this is just one of the articles that came out about it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3014s)

So for those who don't know, after that initial phone call between my friend Kirat Singh and David Wallace, the one that was recorded. Initially, David was pretty angry with me for having recorded it, but on having further conversations with him, he obviously realized my position. I explained to him my background and everything that happened, and he became very sympathetic. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3044s) was helped in that sympathy by this incredibly nasty way the PBCC treated him. Because when the brethren realized that this phone call had been leaked and that David wasn't going to hand me over, they then tried, I think partially successfully, to hack into his computer and phone and they posted private investigators around his house to intimidate him and basically made his life hell, really upset his wife, which [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3074s) course just drove David into my arms, so to speak.

So David had this incredible archive, hundreds and hundreds of emails from Plymouth Brethren members, all sorts of dirty schemes, but he also had an even larger archive, about 10 times that size, of all the other political stuff he had been doing for these, you know, almost exclusively for right-wing parties in Ontario and Manitoba. So to kind of give the maximum publicity to the Brethren stuff, I decided it would be best to publish the whole [lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3116s) because the political stuff was obviously very, very broad interest. I mean, all Canadians are interested in the politics of their country. and I thought well if we can get all of this out there you know make a splash it'll get the brethren stuff the recognition it deserves.

So I call it the Trojan horse which is you know, have a [large](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3146s) …I mean the the Trojan horse story is that the Greeks were besieging this city of Troy, and they couldn't get in because it had high walls. So they built an enormous wooden horse, which they left outside the city, and then the Greeks all sailed away in their ships. And the Trojans thought the Greeks had given up, so they see this huge wooden horse left outside the city, and they drag it into the city square as a sign of their [victory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3176s) And that night a door in the belly of the horse opens and a bunch of Greek soldiers climb out and proceed to kind of slaughter everyone.

 So the Trojan horse means a vehicle you use to get, in this case, information to where it's going to do the most good. So Klondike papers, and it was actually named by Braden Simmons. Braden Simmons came up with the name of the Klondike papers, I put together this archive, 6,400 pages [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3206s) documents, and sent it to a bunch of reporters, including Luke LeBrun, Emily Leedham, and Stephen Magusiak, and they had a lot of fun going through it. And it got onto TikTok as well, and it got over 2 million hits on TikTok, which is phenomenal in a country that's only got a population of about 30 million.

So, and this was June 17\. And yeah, the Klondike papers, they still haven't released most of the Brethren stuff. I'm just happily sitting on it at the moment, keeping them guessing what's actually in there. But I can tell you it's very, very good stuff. That's something to look forward to. Sorry?

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

You're hatching an egg. 

**Richard Marsh**

I am. I am. Yeah, there's lots of sort of cheapings and chippings down below. But yeah, we're just keeping it warm at the moment.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3256s)

Does that mean that 2023 could be even better?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3259s)

Oh, I can assure you. Yeah, we've barely started. This is just the aperitif.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3266s)

Yay\! I love it. Oh, and then this, we want to have her on the show.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3272s)

Yeah, she's awesome. Yeah, now this is a complete change of subject here. This is back to the UK, and this is still June 2022\. Yeah, Cheryl, you take us through this.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3286s)

Yeah, so this is Jessie Shedden. I mean, a lot of ex-members probably know her. She was very vocal on social media when she first came out. She's got a few books written, I think, now, Carman, hey? I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the woman 35 who escaped a religious cult reveals she was blamed for being sexually assaulted at 16, kept under house arrest and didn't know how to use a TV when she finally broke free in her 30s.

So and she's so positive, she's such an uplifting spirit. So she's got a blog going online. She's just, her story is absolutely horrific of what she went through and how she turns it around and creates such a positive movement with it. It's just, she's very, very inspiring. So if you haven't checked her out, definitely check her out. But this article goes into everything that kind of went through. Yeah, there she is. She's just a gorgeous, gorgeous human [being.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3342s) Absolutely gorgeous.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3343s)

There's multiple articles about her in the UK. She's been very, very good at engaging with reporters. Now, I didn't know her personally, but I knew her sister because her sister married someone in my interchange, married Will Brock from Thaxted. Her sister was very nice, but the family was incredibly religious, really, really religious. So much so that they didn't own a microwave oven because microwaves are actually radio waves and that would be having a radio [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3374s) your house.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3374s)

I remember that. I totally remember that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3377s)

Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, that's how that she says she's a great person. She's done a fantastic job in the UK and great, great credit to her. And, you know, keep going, Jesse, you're doing a brilliant job. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3389s)

And we would love to have you on Jesse.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3391s)

Yeah, we would.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3394s)

Okay, so this is...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3397s)

Well, we've got to July, nearly halfway through. Yeah, nothing happening here. It's a mainstream Christian church. This is fun. This is Bruce Hale's son, Dean, his oldest son. And he splashed out, he broke the record for the suburb of Epping, which is like a very posh area of Sydney, Australia, by splashing out on a seven and a half million dollar house there. The previous record holder was Bruce Hales's brother Steve, who bought a slightly less expensive house. 

[Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3437s) what we could see going on here, very fascinating, is a kind of a fratricide or fraternal competition between the Hales boys. They're kind of leapfrogging each other in terms of property. So to start with, Bruce Hales has a big mansion in Epping, and it's kind of built in a chalet bungalow style so it kind of doesn't look too tall from the outside but it's actually got sort of a massive underground basement layer you know we call it the bunker where he [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3467s) sits in his in his leather La-Z-Boy swigging expensive scotch and then his oldest son Gareth builds a very big McMansion next door and this is much more ostentatious it's you know it's got a big high frontage two stories right to the road and it's huge. 

I mean these are sort of thousands of square meters these houses and then they have and each of these houses [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3497s) bought two houses and demolished them to make a big enough lot to build their mansions on. Now since that's happened they've also bought the two houses over the back fence facing onto the next road over and that's being redeveloped. We don't know who for, whether it's for Charles or Greg or one of the sons-in-law, but this is making a massive kind of family compound of these huge mansions, all to ludicrously [high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3527s) specs. You know, everything's gold-plated, everything's electronified, everything is just the latest and best and granite and marble. And anyway, Gareth obviously didn't like to be outdone by Dean. So as we'll see later on, Gareth recently spent, I think it was $10.5 million on a mansion just for weekends. So, you know, he lives the most days in his... Very humble, mainstream Christian church. Now, whether it's because he wants to get away from his dad's beady eye, I don't know, but yeah this is a competition and we're just waiting to see what Dean's next move is [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3569s) leapfrog Gareth in the housing stakes. Probably a good time to invest in real estate in Sydney, they must be driving the prices up.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3578s)

Let's call it extravagant sibling rivalry.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3582s)

Yeah, yeah that would sum it up in three words.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3586s)

Yeah, they're so humble aren't they?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3589s)

Now just remember, oh yeah, here we are, here's another. This is a picture of the place, but apparently, well it looks, it looks, it looks okay. I mean, you know, you make good garden shed, but apparently this is, this is really just bought for the lot. They're going to demolish this and put up something an awful lot grander. But yeah, this is the property. And these are, these are the people who've come cap in hand begging the brethren in North America for, well, they want half a billion, [please,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3620s) to put in an investment fund. Yeah, you can see they need it. I mean, poor things living in such depraved mud huts.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3629s)

Yeah, there's Dean Hales himself. Yeah, look right underneath it. No finance was required on the purchase. You know, this just again every time this comes up it just gets me so irate because we were such a poor family, we grew up so poor. And I guarantee, I mean, I've spoken to people, ex-principals and ex-teachers that have worked through the OneSchool Global system there and again a common theme through all of them is this stark difference between the hierarchy [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3663s) within the brethren and very much so how poor the poor is and how rich the rich is. It's just...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3670s)

Yeah, it's a huge divide and it's getting wider every day.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3674s)

Yeah. But yeah, it's the employers and the employed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3675s)

.Yeah, exactly. And interestingly, you see on the caption to this photo, Dean Hales is global chief executive of Ox Tools. Now Brad Mitchell is also the Canadian manager for Ox Tools. So this is Brad Mitchell's boss. And you can be quite sure that Dean Hales was fully involved in the whole campaign to hire David Wallace and the whole campaign to get rid of Justin Trudeau because this is the guy that Brad Mitchell answers to. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see what we got here. Yeah, we're going around the world. Still in July. The brethren haven't managed to get out of July yet without a few more scandals. So yeah, this is ex-Plymouth brethren church members call for charity status to be stripped. Amen. You know,

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3729s)

I'm actually going to play this. It's only two minutes long.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3732s)

Go for it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3733s)

Let's play this. Hang on. I watched it last night, which is why it's... Bear with me. I wonder why it's not coming up. It was a really good video.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3777s)

I can put a link to it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3779s)

Yeah, I'll put a link to it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3780s)

It was a good... Okay, that's okay. It's not working. Not enough bandwidth. There's actually some interesting stuff down here. Just scroll down a bit because there's links to something else that's going to happen this year that everyone's going to be interested in. This is Rob McLean. Now go back up again. This is all super interesting, super relevant. Up a bit more.

Okay, stop here. Ms. McLean said he was, okay, exclusive brethren member, this is Rob McLean who's calling for the charitable status to be stripped, was among a delegation sent to the United States in the 1980s to meet that farmer, James Symington, who of course is Carman's grandfather, who despite losing his sight and both legs of diabetes held onto his position as global leader of the Brethren until his death. McLean said he was given envelopes by church leaders [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3846s) before he left New Zealand.

“I was given all that money from various parts of New Zealand. There were about 20 of us that went. It was like a church group. I was given all these envelopes. I didn't know what was in them. They said, you give these to Mr Symington. That's our giving from the church.”

 So now scroll down to below the picture. 

“Other members have confirmed our brethren were routinely directed to smuggle large sums of cash across international borders to avoid customs regulations or what's now known as money laundering.”

 The reason I want to draw attention to this is next year, very, very early next year, we're going to reveal just exactly what was in those envelopes and where it ended up and how much of it there was. So [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3897s) this space, Carman, is that right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3901s)

Yes, watch this space.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3903s)

Carman has been doing some very effective research  as we will see.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3909s)

The fun is just beginning.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3911s)

It is, yeah. Oh yes, actually, assemblies also gave thousands to an offshore fund. Just scroll up a bit, Cheryl, on that one. To an offshore fund controlled by Bruce Hales called GCF, General Charitable Fund, which was believed to be for legal costs. So yeah, we'll be hearing more about GCF as well. So this again, again, this is the fund. This is the same kind of, same as the recent GCF fundraiser where they're asking for half a billion, which, you know, we're busy posting stuff on that [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3955s) the moment. And again, do not give a penny to this fund. It's not going to a charitable cause. It's going into the bulging pockets of the fat dollop you see in the picture below.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3972s)

And we're gonna have Rob on our show in the new year.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3975s)

They ask Hales, are we giving you enough, Mr. Hales? And he says, no, no, I'm doing a lot of traveling. I think you could up it a bit.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3988s)

“The Plymouth brethren declined to be interviewed but supplied responses to written questions.” You couldn't make it up.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3996s)

Oh, Brucey. Brucey is so humble, isn't he?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=3999s)

Okay. We're not going to get through the year at this pace. I know. This is July again. Still in July.

” Former Exclusive Brethren members detail the church's money go round.”

 Now that's an interesting story. But yeah, I mean, it's like there's a line here that sums it up.

“The thing I find disturbing is that these are businesses, so their insurance premiums are tax deductible. And on top of that, they also claim back the GST. I view it like an almost like a legalized form of money laundering. It's a round circle scheme they're using their businesses to pay donations back to their own church then they're claiming it back as a tax deductible expense”

 So yeah I mean this is something that Michael Bachelard went into at length but [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4059s) legal but it's exploiting the law in ways the law never envisaged or intended to massively reduce the tax burden on brethren businesses.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4070s)

Yeah. We'll put the link to all these. I just, here's, this is a really good one for everyone to actually sit down and read. There's a lot of information in here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4083s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4085s)

It's, Church and business and family life are extremely, inextricably intertwined in a way that means all parts of the lives are controlled. Llike this has so much information in it that we could spend a whole hour just on on just on this one article itself.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4105s)

But of course “there's no connection between the church and any of the members businesses.”  “They have no interest legal, financial or otherwise in the members businesses.”

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4114s)

Really?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4115s)

Allegedly.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4117s)

Is is that why if you leave the church in your contract, you have to leave your business with the church, but there's no connection there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4128s)

I'm sure a spokesman for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church would rebut all that. I mean, you're obviously a disaffected former member with an axe to grind.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4142s)

Hold on, back up. A disaffected former member with the paper proof in her hand. Well, oh dear.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4151s)

I suspect you possibly have an axe or two as well.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4155s)

Possibly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4156s)

It's biblical. You've heard of the Acts of the Apostles.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4159s)

Yeah, yeah. It's a tomahawk. It goes back to my Indian heritage.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4164s)

Well, yes, the famous Indian heritage of the Symingtons. It's really coming out now, isn't it? Yeah. You'll have Bruce's scalp on your belt by next year.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4178s)

Oh, that might be possible.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4181s)

You might need some disinfectant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4182s)

I just want to read something in here quick.

 “Business owners are sent annual questionnaires about their turnover, gross profit and net profit, and NAF representatives then suggest how much they should donate from their business.” 

So we've had Peter Hart on, everybody's well informed with Peter Hart on our podcast.

“ He balked at paying hundreds of dollars a month to join UBT for business advice he did not have time to read or services he did not need. It was known in my local church that I wasn't subscribing to it. I was treated with disdain like a black sheep and in other parts of the country, I was known for being against UBT. So that was where I felt the pressure. However, staying out of UBT made it easier for him to eventually leave the church, he agreed.”

So I mean, we all know that the businesses are very much intertwined with the church. There's no separation. There's absolutely no separation whatsoever.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4235s)

And they suggest how much you should give. And of course, they're reading all your accounts anyway, so they know exactly how much they can squeeze out of you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4244s)

Yeah, but this has, it's a really good one that goes into how they really do it. I have so many tabs here that my computer is slowing down.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4253s)

Okay, this is back to the UK. And this is again, closely related. Nothing great scandalous here exactly. Church community planning to open a members-only shop in Stafford, which is in the north of England. So this is happening all around the globe. I think they've got 300 going on to 400 Campus\&Co stores. They call it Campus\&Co to maintain the fiction that this is for some educational benefit.

And these are brethren-owned supermarkets. The very simple strategy of Bruce Hales is to capture the entire revenue stream of the brethren, to capture every dollar they spend and take a profit of it, to take a tax on it. So it's like his own private GST or VAT scheme. As you probably heard in the fundraiser that was two or three weeks ago, intense pressure is put on the brethren to direct all their spending [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4313s) the Campus\&Co supermarkets. It's a badge of faith. It's a religious thing almost. You get your stuff from Campus\&Co. 

And as it says,” the store is run by staff and supplemented by volunteers where necessary.” They're all volunteers. In fact, they're not even volunteers. They're all unpaid. This is essentially slave labor because, of course, Because if you're not volunteering at the Campus\&Co store, then [what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4344s) wrong? Is there something wrong with your soul? Is your faith weakened? Do you have doubts about our beloved blubber Bruce Hales? So intense pressure on people to... So basically, they're running a supermarket with free slave labor, the sole purpose of it being to skim a hefty profit of every dollar you spend even on your toilet roll, every time you wipe your ass, Bruce gets a cent of that you know the money you spent on that toilet roll you know, where there's [muck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4374s) there's money. This is happening all around the globe.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4381s)

And I mean, we're gonna, we're gonna in the new year we're gonna release some recordings of that strive 2523 meeting and we've got one on the Campus\&Co…

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4391s)

Brethren, the more you poops, the more he scoops.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4404s)

Oh my goodness, I don't know what he ate your, I don't know what you ate this morning, Richard, but yeah, you're on the roll.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4412s)

Ah the toilet roll yeah. Okay so this is again this isn't scandalous this is just shows what's going on in the Brethren. This is August and a brand new school going up and what's actually happening here is the Brethren have had their own schools for many many years going back 20-30 years now. Then around 2010 there came an immense pressure from Australia for the schools to amalgamate because [most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4447s) localities or interchanges had their own school and so the students were actually going to school locally, just a short car drive or even a walk away from where they lived.

The leadership said that this was inefficient and they wanted economies of scale. So against causing a huge amount of pain to parents and much quiet protesting until it was all squashed by the priests, they closed hundreds, I would imagine, of their local schools and instead they amalgamated to have a much smaller number, maybe a quarter or less number of very, very large schools because of course they could increase the class sizes and they could have enormous efficiencies of scale. They could fill the class with 30 or more students and it basically reduced the cost of the schooling. It could have as much as halved the total schooling bill.

But the downside was that these students, brethren, children, many of them, you know, my own children included, were having to take an hour or up to two hour bus journeys to and from school every day. And as they announced on their presentations, they got a fleet of 750 buses globally or 900 buses globally. So these poor students have to start ridiculously early in the morning, have to get up at six o'clock, [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4545s) up with an hour and a half bus journey to school, can't come home for lunch, and then they've got another bus journey at the end of the day. And it's incredibly exhausting for them. But this is all to save money. And as we know, one school, the brethren system, the ecosystem as they call it, runs a huge surplus. So the real purpose of these economies is not to make it affordable, it's so there's an even larger surplus for the Hales family to cream off for their Sydney property wars.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4574s)

And to keep the children separated. I want to read this really quick. However, the application makes clear that whilst the school is for the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church community, there are no religious studies or daily acts of worship. This is a campus for delivery of education within the national curriculum framework only. So I just want to make sure that people realize that those schools, there's no religious studies or daily acts of worship. Like, how crazy is that to have a Christian school and there's no Bible teachings going on?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4611s)

Nothing Christian at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4613s)

Isn't that crazy?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4613s)

Absolutely crazy. So why do they have their own schools if they're just teaching the national curriculum, which is what's taught in the main schools, and they're not using it as other church schools are used to give a Christian education? The answer is they purely exist to segregate brethren children from normal regular children. And the reason is that if they were exposed to ordinary people. They would [realize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4643s) that they're not actually different, that they're not actually elite, that they're not actually special. They'd realize that other people outside of the church are just the same as they are. And that would destroy the whole illusion that they are some kind of amazing godly elite that are kind of like a different species from the worldly people around them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4665s)

And you know we talk often about how Bruce Hales really knows what he's doing and he really does know what he's doing. So this generation who are inside these schools, no outside contact really, right? Look at that, look what they're being taught. They're taught early the benefit of being involved in a charitable activity to support the community. So he's brainwashing this set, this generation to be heavily involved in RRT which they need to hold their charitable status. Yeah. So I don't even need to add to that. People can put that two and two together. Sorry, my computer is slow now because I've had so many tabs up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4706s)

Yeah, well, you could close some other ones that you've already done.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4709s)

I don't know how to do that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4710s)

Okay. So this is an odd one. This is a murder case that they reopened in Plymouth, which is of course the English town, the English city that the Plymouth Brethren were named after. So, you know, there's been Plymouth Brethren congregation there for 200 years. A grandmother, widow, I believe, called Esther Soper was brutally murdered. And they never found out why. She was beaten to death with a cider bottle and strangled with her own tights. Very, very shocking.

I'm not sure what year that was. I mean, that was in the 70s, I believe. And in fact, it was that that triggered, and I kind of dimly remember this happening. Suddenly, single women in the Brethren were no longer allowed to live on their own. They were all kind of paired up and put two into a house or had to live with other Brethren families. And that was a Brethren's response to this murder. Now, I'm not saying, and there's no suggestion that the brethren were involved in the murder, but it's a complete mystery. Nobody knows why this poor woman was killed.

But they kind of reopened the case because they now have DNA analysis and methods. And it may prove that there was some church involvement in it. There have been some very, very mysterious and ugly deaths. But yeah, so this is a really odd one. So this has got, we've finished August, we're now into September 2022\. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, 27th of September, and this is Wanganui in New Zealand, and, you know, a horrible case of sexual abuse from a former member of the Exclusive Brethren. I don't know what more you could say about it. It's a very disturbing article to read.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4851s)

Yeah, so we let people read that on their own.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4853s)

Yeah. Well, this is a funny one. This isn't directly related to the PBCC. This is a sexual abuse from a minister who was an active member of the Plymouth Brethren Church in Virginia. Now, this isn't the PBCC branch, this is another branch, but it does show that these very closed and [paternalistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4892s) religious groups, there is a strong tendency just because of the way that males are given a unreasonable degree of kind of coercive control over young people it really opens the door to child abuse and sexual abuse and you know that i think the point is here that this isn't just a pbcc problem it also heavily afflicts Jehovah's Witnesses and [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4922s) groups that have the same kind of paternalistic and high control policies.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4929s)

And I know we've been asked, we definitely will bring on like the different branches off of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, there's other branches, right? And so there's the Rentons, there's lots of different branches, and we'll definitely start bringing people on. I know there's people that have been emailing and questioning. And absolutely, if you wanna come on from the other branches, by all means, send us an email.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4951s)

Yeah, I've got a call later today with a Plymouth Brethren historian, and I'm very hopeful he's gonna agree to come on and help to kind of give the big picture because the Plymouth Brethren are at the most between five and 10%, or rather the PBCC are at most five to 10 % of the number of people who actually consider themselves to be Plymouth Brethren. They're a very small minority, very extreme, and have really become very [detached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4981s) from what originally Plymouth Brethrenism was about. So I think it's only fair to the other branches of Plymouth Brethren, some of whom are very good, very good Christians and decent people. It's only fair to them to make the distinction.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=4996s)

Yeah, exactly. So now this gets us into Canadaland. So I've got a few articles here that will attach. This is, so Canadaland was that, oh, I stopped sharing screen, sorry. Canadaland was brought out this fall with a series that had all of us in it. And if you actually subscribe to them, there's some, there is some little mini clips, half our clips where both Carman, myself and Richard are included in that aren't aired, that haven't been aired. You've got to subscribe to them to get them. And they were actually some very, very interesting material that they had. So yeah, so this is [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5039s) three part series.

The one was the first one was about the Klondike Papers. Chapter two was the brethren where we're in and then chapter three was the Trojan horse. So again, another series, it's super, super important to listen to if you haven't already. And then Canadaland did some articles. This is on my case, it's ongoing in Maple Creek. They had done a in depth article on what was going on.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5065s)

That's a picture of the Maple Creek school, by the way, the Maple Creek brethren school. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5071s)

Yeah. So there's, they got quite, Canadaland got quite involved with them producing articles after. This, it goes into all the controversial PPEs that we've gotten into and talked about. And yeah, this is just the links to all of them.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5096s)

Yeah. So it was podcast, but they also did written articles as well on their website, all of which are really good read. And again, all of this stemmed out, I suppose you might say, from that crossing guard who wanted to avoid his union dues because Canadaland, I suppose, would never have happened if it hadn't been for Breaking Brethren, which kind of put the brethren in the media spotlight. So yeah, it would [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5127s) saved a lot of money and trouble.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5128s)

Yeah, it's one of the reasons why I came forward. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I had to share this. So this is Gareth and Charles Hales. Oh, my internet connection is unstable. You know, let me get rid of some of these. Let's get rid of some of these. Yeah, so this is just another article that was from December 11th. This is all about the PPE scandals and contracts.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5169s)

Yeah, so now we've, this is December the 1st. And so we're getting to the end of the year and this is the times again, the PPE which list COVID firms unmasked and what's starting to emerge here And this is going to keep going, keep going, because firstly, they find that Unispace was actually behind a lot of other front companies. So Unispace, which was owned by Gareth Hales and Charles Hales, Bruce Hales' sons, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5203s) actually hiding behind all these other front companies, many of which had either been set up a week or so before they got the contract or else were in completely unrelated businesses. So the hand of the Hales’s behind all this is emerging. This wasn't people operating independently. This was all masterminded out of some extremely expensive properties in Sydney, New South Wales. The other thing that's emerging here and will continue to emerge is that a lot of the [goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5234s) supplied are not actually fit for purpose, and the government has designated them do not supply or do not use and in fact hundreds of tons of this stuff are being put into landfill or incinerated. Now the only reason that they wouldn't be fit for purpose is that they were not specification, they were defective in some way.

Now a lot of this is Unispace stuff but the most shocking one is a company called Inivos owned by the Fentiman family in the UK, who's very closely linked both personally and in business connection with the Hales’s, in particular Greg Hales, who's the Hales son you don't hear so much about, Gregory Hales is closely linked to Innivos. More than 90% of the 127 million pounds worth of PPE they supplied has been earmarked as unsuitable for use. And that's just taxpayer money in the middle of like the biggest financial crisis for maybe 50 years, the biggest NHS crisis for 50 years, all that taxpayer money just going into landfill to enrich a few fat cats.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5316s)

Wow. Okay. And this gets us into one of our most recent podcasts that we've done.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5328s)

One of my favorite stories. Yeah. So this is December the 20th. So they're going out with a bang. I mean, they still got a few hours left. They might pull something out of the hat yet. Except they're probably all, they're probably all flat on the floor at the moment. Oh, where do you, where do you start? Brethren in schools.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5348s)

This is just absolutely, this is one of the most outrageous ones. I have to put this at the top of the list for this year. It has to be. I'm like, who goes to a human rights museum and then asks for like three exhibits to be covered up, right? We've got LGBT ones covered up. We've got women's rights, women's rights and then the abortion stuff. I'm like, yeah, it's just, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5378s) really hope that we can get a hold, I've got a plea out. I really want the Mrs. Kennedy to come on from Egale and really talk with us. I really want to join partners with these people and get somewhere with it.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5394s)

Yeah. I mean, you wouldn't hear a two-year legal battle with 3,000 pages of documents to hide three...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5406s)

How much does a lawyer charge for one letter? Probably about $150.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5412s)

Out of Calgary.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5413s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5414s)

Yeah, you got to use the the peeb lawyer out of Calgary to fight a two-year legal battle and generate 3,000 pages of documents. Amazing, amazing. They really are one bad choice.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5428s)

They're really starting to shoot themselves in the foot though with how they're covering up things, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5435s)

Yeah. Just, yeah, they shoot themselves in the tentacles, I think. I'm not sure they have feet. Yeah, that's true. The interesting link is that the the lawyer other brethren used, Gerald Chipeur, to try and keep them out of court in this case, was the same one that directed them to David Wallace to try and find me. So he's really screwed them over. He directs them to a private investigator who's actually an undercover reporting to the police, and then he makes a complete [hash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5471s) of trying to defend them in this museum case. So I think he's really on our side, Mr. Chipeur. He's done more damage to the brethren than we could ever hope to do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5485s)

So this is another latest. This is that whole area in Windsor that have been asked. They had to, how many people was it that they all had to leave? And all of them. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5501s)

There's no centralized control in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Everyone knows their conscience dictates…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5509s)

Yeah. So another one. And I mean, we kind of have heard behind the scenes what really is going on, right? There was a beef that there was never supposed to be a locality ever put up here. There's a political feud kind of going on between know what Bruce wants and what Bruce can't get. Yep, yeah. And then this is our the latest one that we did with our our spinach that made everybody, I mean we shouldn't laugh but oh I mean I mean you put up a really good post this morning Richard on the “Ex-exclusive Truth about PBCC” about the the faults, like how they really do not follow rules and follow what they should be following and end up themselves in situations such as this.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5564s)

And it'll end the same way. I mean, the firms I was posting about, one of them just went into receivership leaving astronomical debts. And by going into receivership, they walk away with it and the original owner still controls the company. He's just left everyone else holding the debt. And in Symington's day, give him some credit where credit's due, if you went bankrupt, you were out. You were out of the brethren, you probably never came back. But, oh, [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5594s) now. If you can go bankrupt and leave your debts behind, then do it. It's all good.

So yeah, I can see, I mean, there's going to be a massive class action lawsuit. You don't poison 200 or more people and they just sit back and say, well, that was an unfortunate incident. I mean, it was clearly negligence. I'm actually very familiar with the plant concerned because when I was in my teens, we were doing some work on our business premises in Cambridge. And there was a kind of a patch of waste ground in front of the while the building was going on. And this really strange plant popped up with this kind of [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5631s) dramatic trumpet shaped white flower and this weird smell to it. And we looked it up and it was this Jimson weed. It's also called Devil's Snare. And it's a very distinctive plant. It has a strong smell like yeast extract. And it's got oily leaves. You touch the leaves, it leaves like a yellowy oil on your hand, like touching a tomato leaf. It's related, same family. And there's no way you could mistake it for spinach. I mean, it's got [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5661s) pointed leaves with a jagged edge. This is just pure negligence.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5671s)

I think it's ironic something that has the name as the Devil's Snare and yeah right I'm like...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5676s)

It's a it's a funny plant because it's actually used in voodoo witchcraft. It's very strongly associated with witchcraft. Oh wow, yeah, yeah, look it up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5690s)

Yeah. You know how they always put on us, right, when bad things happen to us, oh, it was, you know, what did you do wrong? That's, I put it back to them now. Like, what did you do wrong to have a plant called that poison this many people?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5701s)

I know. Satanic, the satanic spinach of the saints. I mean, we'll have to get into limericks again sometime, but that's probably for another podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5712s)

Yeah. Oh wow. It was an eventful year. We have a lot coming up. We have a lot planned for 2023\. I don't know how we're to fit it all in, but we will.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5723s)

Yeah, and I guess we sidelined a couple of good ones today. Yeah, yeah, review.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5729s)

Oh yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5731s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5732s)

There's, it's just, there's a lot of this. I guess my biggest, my biggest thing for ending this year is is, I just appreciate everybody who's come forward and not only just on our podcast but worldwide that are really, everybody's stepping up to the front row and really putting in a good effort of trying to expose what we need to expose. My heart goes out to those that are inside that have reached out to me. I'm going to tell you, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5762s) think about you when I wake up in the middle of the night. I think about you when I go to bed. I think about you in the morning. Yeah, I first and foremost that is who is on my mind. It's just, I'm gonna try not to cry.

It might, my heart's with you, my heart is with you. And I understand how you're, how you feel stuck. I understand that there's families that are wanting to leave but can't leave because of businesses. We for 2023 that I think there's we've got a lot of big things on our plate that we are going to bring in hopefully gain some traction in the judicial and legal sense of things, so keep reaching out to us keep sending us your emails, keep sending us things that you want us to talk about that you know are helping other people inside there.

And to the ex-members that [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5818s) still trying to find their your voice there's no better time to do it than now. This is the time to come forward and don't compare your story to other people's stories, because just being out, just having the doctrine of separation placed with you is enough to talk about, it's about everybody coming on here and getting out and getting your voices heard, so don't think that your story is not enough because it is.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5845s)

Yeah, what one thing I would say to people inside there at the moment is even if you don't feel confident enough already to actually share anything with us or share anything with anyone,, keep good records. Everything that, everything that happens to you and the brethren and every email you get, every begging letter, everything from UBT, everything that's like announced initiatives, keep a record of it. Keep it on a thumb drive somewhere. Just just [sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5875s) on it. If it, if it gets to the time, if it gets to the point where you do want to leave or an opportunity opens for you to leave, all those records will be extremely important. 

And the reason is that the brethren try and tie you down in a whole load of legal agreements relating to your business, your family, everything else, all this legal stuff, which is very complicated. But there's an overriding law relating to coercive control that says that if you've been under [coercive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5906s) control, when you signed that agreement or agreed to this or you donated that money, then that action can be reversed because it wasn't made of your own free will. And so to keep a record of everything that happened is extremely important. Just keep it somewhere safe and I promise you you'll find it, it really pays dividends. And at some point you may feel like sharing it, maybe just keep it to yourself, but this, this is exactly what the brethren [do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5936s) not want you to do. They don't want you to keep a record of what is going on because a lot of it will turn out to be illegal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5943s)

And you have a right to say no to priestly visits and if you do get them, record them.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5951s)

Yeah, definitely record.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=5952s)

Yeah. Yeah. But okay, I just wanted to share this last, our resources here. I just updated the resources that we usually have at the end of a podcast. I've got added more of the books that have been released this year. And I guess in the last few years, I've added, we've added all the different mental health support lines, because we understand that not everybody from inside can access them. Plus, we also have all of the LGBTQ support lines. So that is there for everyone. And we just want to wish everyone a Happy New Year. And we're just very grateful for all the support and the patience you've had as we've tried to figure out what we're doing on this end with something that we don't really know a whole lot about. But, you know, we're doing what we can. That's all you do. You just jump in and do what you can do. So anyhow,

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=6017s)

And if you thought 2022 was fun, just wait. Fun has only started.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=6024s)

Yeah, Carman's got some stuff up her sleeve.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=6026s)

We're gonna be hearing an awful lot more from Carman in in in the next year.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=6032s)

It's all good. It's good. It's things that people need to know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3FAF0i_WE&t=6035s)

Yeah. Anyhow, happy new year everyone. We're very, very thankful for all of you. Take care. We'll see you next year. Yeah, bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
