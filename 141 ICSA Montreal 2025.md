It was an incredible, productive, and meaningful week for us, and we're so grateful to everyone who supported us in getting there, especially those who contributed to our fundraiser.

We've also included Dr. Jill Mytton's powerful presentation on child sexual abuse, featuring preliminary data from the groundbreaking research she and her colleagues are [conducting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=52s) If you haven't already completed the questionnaire for that study, please, please take a moment to do it. Your participation is vital for advancing understanding of high-demand religious groups and the lasting impact they have.

Just a quick note, these audios were recorded live and may have a bit of background noise, but we've done our best to preserve the clarity and impact of each speaker. Thank you for your understanding, and thank you again for being here and for being part of this growing community committed [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=83s) truth, healing, and change. 

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

…Ben from Australia, all the way here too. I've known Jill for years and years and years. Together, and then we've got Richard Marsh here. So we're all former members of the Exclusive Brethren. We're from the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, as it's called now. And let's see if I can look at this.

So this is our Get-A-Life podcast channel that we started three years ago. Yeah, so our main thing is we just want to show you the impact of our podcast that we started. I am actually from Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. I left actually when I was 17\. I was severely abused in there. I was sexually trafficked and I was sitting at home one night watching TV and the Breaking [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=144s) documentary came on.

I had been silent for like 30 years and my husband found it, popped it up and I was like let me watch it and yeah here we are today. I went and did a police report and we've now gone really, really big with helping the insiders. We've helped many, many. I finally came forward with my story and I gave a nine-hour police report and over two days and in between that police report, I went on Blackballed. This was the podcast that changed my life that I had no idea what we were signing up for.

After this podcast, my inbox became just flooded. All social media, anybody that could try and get a hold of me were getting a hold of me. The stories that started landing on my lap were horrendous, like absolutely horrendous. I never thought that I was alone in this, but I also didn't realize that the abuse was as deep as it was in there. It was, yeah, it was heart-wrenching. It was very, very heart-wrenching. And I finally realized that we needed to do something about this, and it was about trying to find a platform.

So, of course, I had already teamed up with Richard, and there was a couple others that started with us, and we decided, hey, let's start this podcast and give a platform for survivors. And I think the big thing that the survivors were looking for was a platform that was provided by a survivor for [survivors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=237s) It was really what they were up against. James did really, really good with us at the beginning, and he tried bringing on as many as he could, but there was, again, a lot of people who were, they didn't know him. They knew that he wasn't a part of the cult. And so he kind of hit those obstacles.

And that's when I was like, you know what, let's try and do this. I had no idea of how to start a podcast, how to do any editing. I mean, technology and me do not see [eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=267s) to eye. And it just had to be done. So we started there. So yeah, we started off Get-A-Life conversations. Conversations is what we started. And I think there's a part of you after leaving a high-control group that resigns yourself to that. There's really nothing you can do to make these changes, especially when you're born in there.

You're born and you're indoctrinated so deeply to think that you don't have the power. There is no way to do any change. There's no way to get through to people, and I think our podcast when it went out and everything that came sliding back at us, I think we realized you know what, we do, we really do have [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=310s) sort of power here to be able to not only sit and address the bridge from inside to outside because it was the hardest move to make.

It was all of us ex-members getting together and being able to sit and devise a plan on what would be the best way to do this right because it is, I mean obviously we all have our own personal stories and our personal, I guess you could quote unquote say agenda, but there's a bigger picture. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=340s) bigger picture was really, is it possible to be able to get inside a system like this who's the brethren and can you reach a level deep enough to be able to make change? And that is and literally is what's happening now.

We just put out Podcast 139 on their charity. And again, the inbox is just keep flooding in with people who either dealt with the Rapid Relief Team, people who have been a part of OneSchool Global, [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=370s) who have worked for OneSchool Global. It's just clear across all of the people that they affect started coming forward. Okay, so after sharing my own story publicly, again, I knew we needed a platform run by survivors for survivors. A safe landing pad was the biggest thing that we were trying to provide.

We also realized this platform could help those still inside feel seen, validated and heard. And maybe even begin to question the narrative that they've been given about people like us. So that was the biggest thing, was being able to rebrand the term opposer. Right? So for me, I had an uncle that was out, and I was brainwashed from the time I was a little, little girl that this man was evil. Absolutely don't have anything to do with him. He's evil. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=420s) is. They just paint the picture.

So when I left, I didn't even get a hold of him because I'm so scared of him. So that was a big challenge that we wanted to do was be able to rebrand the narratives that when someone leaves in there, what it is that they're being fed in there is not true. So it was putting these podcasts out. We'd get so many people that would reach back up to us and be like, that's not the story I was told. That's not the story we were told. Like, I thought this happened. I thought that happened. And so bringing [those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=450s) survivors on really did help clear up a lot of the lies and untruths that when someone leaves gets spread.

And that sparked a complete domino effect. People still inside the cult began watching the podcast. On their own, hidden devices, in complete secrecy, many quietly making plans to leave. We actually have someone in the audience today, Andrea here, who, she was inside watching the podcast secretly in little five-minute increments, and later found out her husband was doing the same thing. And so she had reached [out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=490s) to us and we helped get their family out and they just celebrated their two-year anniversary. So the whole family's out and you know, it's stories like that are just absolutely why we do what we do.

And there was actually another ex-member that was supposed to be here who she had actually been admitted into a hospital like nine times for abuse. And I had put a post on [Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=520s) I had just said that if anybody inside was suffering from sexual abuse that they were welcome to contact me. I would be confidential, you could do it anonymous. Within 15 minutes I had a message and she had said I saw your post, I'm inside, I'm actually hiding in my parents' basement right now, kind of gave me a little bit of her information and then I called her and she got home. Her and her son escaped it.

And yeah, so it's like, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=550s) no story, but that's why we do what we do. Absolutely why we do. And thank goodness for social media, right? We wouldn't be able to do this if we didn't have the power of social media that we do today. And the blessing that inside the cult, they have access to technology now. To me, I think it was one of their biggest blessings for us and probably what they think is one of their biggest mistakes because a lot of people have devices that don't have their Streamline 3 on it.

So [inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=581s) the Exclusive Brethren, all the devices you have to purchase from there, and they all have what's called Streamline 3, and then there's another one. So it's like they take screenshots of your computer, laptop, phone, whenever they want, and you sign saying that you're okay with that. In the recent months, specifically in the last couple weeks, I've had a growing number of insiders that have stopped going to church, literally just stopped going.

And they're getting their priestly [visits,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=611s) many unannounced, and are gaining strength through the power of our podcast and information on our podcast to start challenging the brethren. I actually had a conversation with someone who hasn't gone to church for three months, and he is full phone on meeting these priests head on every single time because he's taken and strained all the information from the podcast and he's armed with it now and gained this massive courage to be [able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=641s) to get justice and seek justice for his family.

His family's on the bottom of the totem pole, have gone through a ton of stuff, but through being able to take all the information down from the podcast has challenging every single piece that lies on this doorstep. I actually told him I said I would love for you to just you know copy what you're doing if I could just pass it on to everybody else because not everybody has that kind of courage and bravery to stand up. We have somebody else who is battling Priestly visits and he's not able [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=671s) stand up to them.

And it's, again, a couple hour phone call every time he has a Priestly visit to try and get him back up on his feet, but it is the power of these, the information, all the survivors that have come in who have been able to battle Bruce Hales who you see here at the front and center. And the person that took this picture is now out as well.

I guess one of the biggest issues we knew we had to confront was the gaslighting that happens inside the cult. That is, it really, especially when you're indoctrinated from birth, it is one of the hardest things to tell between what is real, what is their narrative, and what's actually happening. Most people had no real understanding of what was happening inside, even the people up here a lot of people didn't understand why they changed their name from the Exclusive Brethren to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. That was a completely another cover-up that happened.

When they lost their charity status in 2012, yeah for the UK, in order for them to get their charity status back they had to come out and that's when their Rapid Relief Team was created and that's the face many of you guys see out there doing all the good work. And we are not negating at all their work that they're doing. It's good work that needs to be done. The thing is, it is very much their front on how [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=771s) gain what they need to gain. And we just are on the podcast. I just explained all that on the RRT.

I actually want to tell a story about this. I'm going, I'm just figuring out what I was planning on saying. So I met up with an ex-member who was having a conversation with her dad who was passing away right now. And they were not allowing her to come. And she decided, you know what, I'm just going to come. I'm just going to go there. He's in the hospital. And she got to have some one-on-one time with him. And he had no clue that this website existed. She showed him this, and he thought the opposers created this.

She showed him what it said. She showed him the Q\&A, and he was appalled, absolutely appalled at this. So this is your regular Christian [grassroots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=826s) brethren, not somebody who's up on the high totem pole. This is just your plain Jane grassroots brethren who's sitting in and just waiting for the Christian sermon. And when she showed him all this, he had no idea. She showed him that she was allowed to sit and be with him. She was allowed to be at his funeral, and yeah like it's some of their, their website is probably one of their most misleading Q\&As that I think we've ever seen [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=856s) it is false. It is a complete and utter false narrative. They do not go by this and we have 139 podcasts, go find survivors, they will reaffirm everything on here is not true.

This is inside there. This is a, this is a fellowship meeting. This is, are they standing up here? No, we do have a picture where they're all standing up as Bruce Hales gets up to leave and you notice all the women are in the back, all the men are in the front. They've got their white shirts on. So anybody who doesn't understand the Plymouth Brethren, the women do not say anything. The women are submissive to the men. They give out a hymn number, that is it. And that is their retirement they wear. And so when Bruce Hales is in present, it's white shirt, white shirt only. And you'll get a letter that goes out making sure that everybody has their white shirts on.

As one of the biggest questions we often ask ourselves is, why are we able to do what we're doing now as opposed to 20 years ago? And the biggest question is it's social media. Social media has opened up doors for us that, I mean, Jill can attest to this. She's our OG in this. She started this years and years and years and years ago. I was like, you weren't, though, right? But compared to what you did all those years ago to what we're doing now, social media really has been the biggest gift to get the exposure and the truth out to the narratives and the false narratives that are out there about this.

Okay, so I wanted to give you guys a visual [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=962s) the power of social media. So this is me. I watched the Breaking Brethren documentary. My first thing I did, I googled Richard Marsh because he is who I wanted to get a hold of. For many of you that don't maybe understand or know his story, so there was an audio that was leaked of a private investigator that was hired to hunt him down and this private investigator, this audio I got a hold my hands on and his name was David Wallace.

I wanted to get, I needed to talk to him because the [complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=993s) of what I went through inside there, I was trying to find somebody who could piece together pieces for me of what happened to me. And so when I listened to that audio, I'm like here it is. I've been silent for 30 years. Is this the time that I can finally literally unsit me and be able to do what I needed to do all these years? But because my case was so, so complex, I knew I needed a [platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1024s) that wasn't just going to throw it back into the closet. Because it has a lot of things that many people, when they listen, they're like, that's, that's, I don't know, I don't think you went through that. But I am living absolute proof that sex trafficking happens inside this hall.

So I found where Richard Marsh was, messaged him, and he was about to do a podcast on Blackballed. At first I had to convince him that I was me. He didn't quite believe I was me. He had stayed at my parents' house, he had stayed with my siblings and he's like I had no clue they had another daughter which I mean for me what is, I mean it's a big knife in the heart right is you know you hear those stories, you know that they take your pictures out of the picture books but to actually hear it from somebody of like are you sure you are who you are?

And I mean I do this to ex-members all the time that contact [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1084s). I'm like I always need to make sure that they are who they are and it's not someone that's just trying to get information from me. And so once he agreed, you know, okay if I gave him enough information that I was who I was, he's like I think you need to do this podcast. And so from there that's when I went and I actually went to the, well James on the Blackballed was like, you know I don't really take people on if they haven't done a police report.

And I had been talking to a friend of mine at the child advocacy center about going public and she was worried about my safety [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1115s) she said you know what, was the police here today? Would you like to come down and talk to her? And I said, yeah, I'll come down and talk to her. I said, but I'm not doing that. I'm not going to go down that road. I don't want to have to subject my own trauma to sitting and having to, they dissect you. Like they, they dissect you beyond anything you've ever experienced in your life.

So I went down and for an hour and a half I talked to this female RCMP officer and she finally convinced me of why to do it. And so I went and I had to do it. It was nine hours. The first day was five hours and the second day was four hours. And I did this podcast in between the two. It was, I think I'm still trying to gain regulation from that [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1165s) it's not, if anybody's ever done any kind of a police report is you just can't say very vague things. It's the most minute details that you can remember that have to be given.

To date, I'm still three years ago, three years ago on the 29th was three years since I gave my police report and it is an active investigation but it's got a lot of roadblocks to it [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1196s) I don't, I don't hold weight in the sense that that's where I'm going to get my justice. This is where I get my justice. It's in a room like this. It's in the survivors that get out. As much as I would love to find my perpetrator and not even behind bars but in a facility right because it's about rebuilding humans right?

It's not about just throwing them in jail and being like you did wrong so this is where you go. Does he belong there? Absolutely, he absolutely belongs there. But first and [foremost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1231s) like I'm like humanistic, just loves to see humans be rebuilt, find out why people are the way they are and find like what in society can help rebuild this. That is my biggest, biggest dream and why I do what I do. Yeah, I'm really off from here.

Okay, so when we came on board we had two main people that came on board or that we really started collaborating with. One of them is Michael Bachelard, so he is an Australian journalist who wrote the book Behind the Exclusive Brethren. An incredible, incredible man. I'm not sure if anybody here has ever heard of him but if you haven't read his book, definitely read his book. He came on and we've been collaborating with him ever since. And then we have Damian Hastie, he is from the UK and he just launched, actually Richard's going to go into this, but he just launched an app and a website that you can search every business, charity, anything from the brethren on this app and website.

And then our next person that we came across was Ben Woodbury. So this article came out and I was like, I've got to get it. Ben was quoted in it and so I messaged him on Instagram. He took forever to get back to me. Now I've adopted him as my son. So those three people who I think are building block to be able to do what we're doing now, Ben Woodbury is going to speak later and he's got a massive following social media wise. He has the patience and the intellect to be able to do technology but I cannot.

And then since once this all took off, we started getting a ton of requests for doing podcasts. We did Sean Attwood’s True Crime podcast, which you and I did. We did Canadaland. Canadaland had a three-part expose called Rat… That's where it's yeah it's called Ratfucker. Yeah so it's a three-part, it's an excellent, excellent expose on Klondike Papers and everything that happened through that. We've done the Cult Vault in the UK, Carmen Smith Studer’s podcast and we really realized that we have the support out here to be able to do what we are doing.

And I think anybody who's been a part of a cult understands how deeply important [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1389s) is because it's so easy when we live, I'm living inside my trauma every single day. There's no escaping it anymore because my phone goes from sunup to sundown all through the night and you're, you're living, you're inside it. So for me personally, support is like number one for me. I have to make sure I have the support. I'm a very emotional person. Richard, the brains of the operation, and I'm like, I'm a [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1419s) very, very emotional person. I get very attached to everybody who contacts me, any survivor that's on the podcast. Yeah, it takes a couple days. So support is massive, massive for us. And the word was getting out. We knew that this is what we needed.

And what we have today is an ongoing dialogue between ourselves, insiders, journalists, teachers, police, research investigators, and many, many other survivors of the high-demand religious groups. With the PBCC, one of the biggest turning points and ironically one of our greatest gifts was when they gained access to technology. I mentioned this before. Once that door opened, social media became our most powerful tool to reach inside and let people know you are not alone.

This is our last podcast that we just did. Today we've released 139 podcasts. Episodes of Get-A-Life and the momentum we've started is unstoppable. We've heard from insiders that the PBCC has made surface level attempts to respond to the issues we've raised but true to form, nothing is being done to address the systemic problems at the heart of this group. It's all optics designed to protect their image and above all their charitable status.

So I'm just going to expand on that a little bit. We have, they do have safeguarding things are happening in there. Here's the thing that we find. So with the amount of insiders we have, these [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1509s) get pushed out there and within hours we get them all coming back to us and being like this was a joke, this is what we were told to say, this is what we were told to do, but it was a check the box kind of thing. Their safeguarding policy was a check the box kind of thing to be able to again gain traction with their charitable status. For me, that's the heart-wrenching part of this.

I actually, I'm actually dealing with two 17-year-olds in there right now. I've had an email from an anonymous 14 year old girl  being sexually abused right now. That's hard. It's super hard to, you know, I had, I reached out and talked to somebody about it they said can she call a social worker? I'm like absolutely not, you do not understand the dynamics that would place on that little girl. Social worker shows up there, that little girl can't say yes, I'm being sexually abused. She can't.

So I think we, we create these brochures, we're looking for people [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1584s) come and help us. We're looking for people to be more of a voice with us for this set because it needs to. We have, there's more members in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church than there are in Scientology. Yeah, wow. So we found out Scientology is, is that...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1604s)

They are down to about 40,000, they claim 200 but that’s just their advertising Real numbers is about 40\. Well Plymouth is 55,000 global.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1619s)

Yeah. So I think the biggest reason why we came to this was because we also need your help. Like that's our biggest, that's our aim right now is having help outside of our group, outside of what we are doing to be able to get the ball rolling a little bit more and being able to expose what really is happening behind their doors. Because it's awful. It's horrendous.

We received, I got some, I actually have, I'm going to read this one message. I have a ton of messages. This is the only one I'm going to read to you. Okay, so:

“Hello from someone still in the PBCC. I just want to say thank you for being a voice for those of us who have not figured out how or been strong enough to use our own. For being a place people like myself can find themselves able to directly relate to others on. I saw sending an email as an opportunity to try and find my voice, to do something, start somewhere.

I'm not sure I'm prepared for or know what comes next, but I can't keep trying to ignore it. So here it is. I wish I didn't need to be anonymous, but unfortunately I'm not at a point where I can say who I am. I appreciate your understanding of this. Do you really hear from lots of us in here? I'm truly curious how many from what countries. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1700s) wish there was a way for us to know and support each other. Somehow we need to be able to find each other in here.

I don't know how it would work if people would trust each other. I'm very certain there would be undercover people trying to find us under the guise of agreeing being one of us. Personally, I'm just simply done with it all, but I don't know what to do. Everything is so deeply entangled. I went seeking some sort of confirmation. I'm not totally crazy when I started to get the sense I'm not the only one that might have these feelings, and apparently that feeling was right.

[I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1730s) don't have a desire to cause a big stir. I try to explain my beliefs to anyone inside that would try to convince me otherwise. But as you know, it's not as easy as just standing up and walking away. It begins to feel sort of hopeless, like you're intentionally trapped. You were made to feel like your struggles are your own fault because you weren't, aren't obedient enough, didn't follow closely enough, when actually it's the furthest thing from the truth.

It's been a slow burn for me as things have kept more exclusive and really just bizarre and nonsensical. It sort of comes over you in ways, then eventually you're faced with, what am I going to do about it? This is where I wish there was some way to connect with others inside that are feeling the same way, and maybe the support of each other would enable us to advocate for change, to stand up for ourselves together. I feel like what might have been original intentions of following a sort of simple Christianity went out the window a long time ago in this group.

It basically seems like a [campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1785s) to secure and maintain revenue streams at this point, in my opinion. Long story short, I want to say thanks to everyone.”

 And this is just like, when I wake up in the morning, I scroll through pages and pages and pages because I'm in Canada and of course New Zealand, UK, Australia is and it's just messages after messages that we get. So because I went over, I was planning on playing you a Survivor video but it's 10 minutes long and do you want to play it or no?

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=1852s)

Hi, my name is Ailsa Schlaudraff. I was abused by my ex-husband in the PBCC for 16 years. Three and a half years ago, I escaped with my daughter. After I left, the priests told me that because in their view, my daughter belonged to the church and not to me, they would fight me for custody for as long as it took. Three and a half years later, I have full power of attorney over my daughter. And my ex-husband has been convicted of child abuse. And yet he remains protected, supported and cared for in the PBCC. And I'm shunned.

Then when I was 16 years old they tried to force me to marry a 28 year old man from India. After I left the Brethren I had secret contact with my parents. After my father died the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church told my dementia suffering mother that they were taking her on holiday. They took her to Australia and kept her there until [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2084s) passed away. This was against her express wish to return to her UK home.

### [**Dr. Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2259s)

Hello. My name is Richard Marsh. When I was a teenager in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I could not accept their ever more extreme rules and edicts on separation from the world. I didn't believe it to be an egregious sin to share a cup of tea with a local vicar, but they did. Because of this I was excommunicated and expelled from my home to a very cold caravan in a field outside Cambridge. That was over 60 years ago now and I've not been permitted to see any of my large family since. Just recently they deliberately chose not to tell me of the deaths of my two brothers to make sure I did not attend their funerals.

I disagreed, withdrew from them. 25 years later, I enjoyed freedom with most of my family and I won't stop trying to get the rest of my family out of that evil, disruptive cult.

### [**Peter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2365s)

Hi, I'm Peter. Three years ago, I asked the Brethren questions about why they were litigating ex-members and about the leader's conduct. I was excommunicated for this. My wife and children chose to stay with the Brethren because the fear of leaving and I have no contact with them at all.

### [**Jill Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2388s)

I'm Jill Mytton, a counselling psychologist, researcher and former member of the Brethren. I left at the age of 16 when my parents decided to leave. I lost my brother and several other close family members. Over the last 30 years I've been researching the well-being of former members and I found evidence that support the stories told in this video. Stories of sexual abuse, of trauma, of depression, anxiety, tales of loss and grief, harm and detriment.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2434s)

In 2016, I escaped the Exclusive Brethren cult. As seen in the previous video, gay men are not accepted in the Exclusive Brethren. And if they will try anything, even up to chemical castration, to ensure that you do stay and try and make you stay. So, I reached out to, or Cheryl reached out to me about three years ago, and I had just started out on social media sharing my story. And I'm not part of Get-A-Life but why I'm here today is to talk about the reach, the surprising reach of Get-A-Life because I've witnessed it as an ex-member and also as speaking on social media.

I've heard it from so many members within. People that just associate it that aren't brethren, maybe [teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2485s) that have worked in schools or neighbours of the, but also want explaining of what is a lot of peculiar habits or behaviours of the cult. In turn, it's cult life brutality. So, before I talk about the reach of Get-A-Life, I'd start out by just giving you a bit of background about me. This is me within the cult, and if you're new to the Exclusive Brethren, they have catalogs, which is called the photograph books where families are put in localities, areas, and in a way, we call it catalogs because we all knew this is how you got to find your wife or your husband and when you get married off.

And this is me and my family. And a bit of background about [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2531s) family life, it wasn't, as you can see, the most pleasant of experiences. These are just, I became a very, when I got a mobile phone, which was very non-brethren and worldly as they call it, I took comfort in visually diarising everything because I used to write a lot of things down but my dad would find that and destroy that. So I started taking photos and videos and today it's really helped me to visually look back on it and see how far I've come but also share it with the greater world to help [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2561s) members leave.

Now this is more about what it was like for me in there. I was under constant surveillance. I used to find letters in my grandpa's desk or printer, because I was a very nosy kid, about my behavior, about their solutions of what they would do. And I know it's probably hard to read, but essentially this was a great narrative about how I didn't come home on time and their solution was to illegally foster me out, which is essentially what a lot of brethren kids, happens to a lot of brethren kids that don't [behave.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2591s)

And then after leaving, this is my family in the updated photo book, and as you can see it's like you don't exist and I think that's the only visual way I can tangibly explain what it's like to be in the brethren. You were there and then you don't exist. So I wanted to show you before I get on to the reach of the Get-A-Life podcast, my relationship with my mother was very sort of one-sided. I always told her happy birthday, happy mother's day, and kind of you know emotional narratives I guess you could say. I would say poetry and things like that.

And then I spoke up because they were forced to move from the area because the leader told them to. And in doing that, I spoke to a newspaper article about my experiences and it was published. And then my mum had to stop having contact with me. And then this is it to show you, I guess it's quite a timeline and it goes back quite a way that [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2651s) year I still reach out to my mum and with no reply because obviously now she is not allowed to say to me because I become an opposer. And that's what they call anybody that leaves. You can leave and you're excommunicated and you're ashamed, but if you speak up about them, you then become an opposer. Which again is just another part of their hierarchy of, you know, how to label and bring into people ultimately to invalidate their existence.

So I took to TikTok and very new to all social media as I didn't grow up with, you know, I didn't even grow up with books and I shared my experiences and it was my first sort of, I woke up the next day with my phone, you know, I used to have notifications on and it blew up and I didn't expect it to, but the reach of that to sharing authentic experiences and this is what I wanted to show you. You know, we've got the first video I did has 1.9 million views. And then the next one is half a million. And I didn't know that there was power in that or where it reached.

And then this one here, which I'm not gonna play for you because it's quite traumatic to watch for myself. And as I said, as I mentioned before, I have quite a visual diary of my life. Just for me, because my therapist, years ago, when I sat a therapist, I was like, you should do this. You know, you don't like writing down in a journal because it's triggering because they used to have to always hide that. So I started this and then I thought, well, that worked. And I had an insider reach me and go, well, that actually really helped me on my journey.

So I shared something because I think we have this false idea when we are about to leave a cult that [everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2752s) beyond that is, you know, butterflies and maroons. And it really isn't. And for a lot of people that have, you know, helped on their journey to leave, it's often worse because before you had the hope that something was better and often to leave that and realise that life isn't really, you know, we're not going to pay the bloody bills. You know, life isn't as glamorous as we think.

And I shared this moment of me visiting my mother to plead with her to say, you don't even like the area that you're being forced to move to and how are we going to manage to make contact? And coming away from that, I sort of downloaded onto a video how it felt. And I woke up the next day and that video went viral. And the point of all that is, you never know who is watching. And my first point, and I do thank Get-A-Life, and I thank Jill, she crawled so the rest of us could walk.

Thank Get-A-Life, I want to take that moment to thank Get-A-Life because without your consistent efforts, and you were doing it a long time before I even did my podcast with you, it's really, it helps everybody, even after nine years out, and it still helps to listen to her and compartmentalise things. You never know who's watching. People trapped inside the cult and recent escapees. My DMs are always full of members planning on leaving and needing help.

People in DMs asking about their trauma and current issues they're facing, whether they're gay, straight, whatever. I get messages from a lot of people trying to work out how to just deal with the trauma that they're going with. And then from a recent escapee, this was such a beautiful, I've never sort of seen the full moment of not having, meeting somebody. Always in my DM as an anonymous person, he said he listened to my podcast, which thanks to Get a Life did.

And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2870s) said in the podcast, and I don't remember saying it, that I can imagine myself when 40 years old being trapped in there and after… married to a woman miserable with three kids and that was his exact moment he said I listened to that he said I turned 40 I looked at my life I'm married I'm gay positive with three kids and that was just such a wholesome I don't know one of those little yippee moments where he you know he's been out six months now and he's fulfilling dreams that he never thought he'd even had to get a chance [at.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2900s)

Another thing I want to talk about is the organisations who unknowingly affiliate with the cult’s PR machine. Now Cheryl mentioned it earlier, they have a charity called the Rapid Relief Team which was set up to maintain their charitable status because they rely so heavily on their tax breaks for being a religious organisation. And in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church I battled with things like suicide and mental health and we had no access to any of that. And so I reached out to Headspace Geelong and a few of us did as well and said the Rapid Relief Team are a part of a cult that I escaped in which we had no access to your organisation.

You know your organisation is a great advocate for mental health in which we had no access to because of this ban, yet they will use you to maintain their charitable status. And [Geelong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2953s) Headspace Geelong which is quite a big Headspace group within Australia next to quite a big organisation of exclusive brethren cult members, they reached out, we reached out to them and they did their own research and came back said we were told that they told them that they will no longer affiliate with them because their values don't align, which is a great moment in history for us and then removed all the posts affiliated with them.

As much as, you know, I didn't grow up with it, and as much as [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=2983s) lot of us, probably a lack of social media is so, can be so frivolous and, you know, there's so much more to it that can be used as a tool that can be used to effectively get a message with unlimited reach from one corner of the globe to the other. Now, I want to share something with you. I went to my local polling booth to vote and saw two members of the Exclusive Brethren or the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church campaigning, handing out Liberal flyers, which is so odd to me because [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3013s) not allowed to vote in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church or the Exclusive Brethren because “government is of God” so you don't vote because God has power over everything.

So why are they so active in this old town? I'll tell you why they're active because this is a Labor scene and the Brethren have taken them upon themselves to campaign nationwide for the Liberal team. Now I don't know if Liberal individual Liberal members are aware of this but surely. Now they're obviously a bit paranoid about me coming because I barely landed onto the property and this is how [evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3044s)\-eyed they were. They saw me and ran to the car park. So my question remains, if God is so powerful and so in control, then why can you let this election up to him to vote? 

Okay, so the point I want to share here was I went to vote at a polling booth. Now, an exclusive government is not allowed to vote because government is of God, and I went down there and noticed there were a couple of members, there's nobody left in my area that that are members anymore and so it was very odd to me that there were two members that weren't even local from a very different area of the cult there handing out papers in what looked like an attempt in a disguise.

And sure enough I put out this video my [inbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3097s) there was flooded with DMs from anonymous friends within sharing screenshots recordings links to on how the Australian exclusive brethren members had set up a nationwide operating the scheme to essentially heavily campaign and flood on every polling booth the Liberal, and I have to say in case you don't know that Liberal means very Conservative so what we call the Conservative party in Australia I think they did that to trick everybody.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3129s) essentially I took did that and back to my point of you never know who is watching again, I left the TikTok went back to my normal life with dusting antiques and then I had a flood of journalists reach out and it became I think 11 or 12 articles from that one TikTok. And Michael Bachelard from The Age, you've got the Australian you have Daily Mail because everybody was asking the same thing but nobody, and that's just what I say to a lot of ex-members and a lot of leaders is you might not think your story is relevant.

You might not think that little assault that happened to you in the back of the you know hay shed is relevant but you put it in a public domain you never know who's watching and you never know how important it was because I didn't have the literal proof right then other than my hunch that they are involved and a couple [DMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3180s) then it was validated by everyone else in Australia sending me photos of you know 200 kilometers away I'm like I can identify every one of them, they are brethren, and then every single photo that came in of them, I was able to identify they are brethren from different areas to the local spot that they're standing at, which means that that is strategy, that is an implemented system, and then we got proof that it was.

And then, a week later, Australian Prime [Minister,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3210s) I'll play this,

### [**Anthony Albanese**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3212s)

…called him for what it is. What we know is that they are combining with One Nation here and in other places, trying to do these preference deals. You have all sorts of strange occurrences with, you know, a cult, the Exclusive Brethren that they need to explain going forward. Where are all these people coming from? Why are they campaigning on booths? They don't vote, by the way, but they all of a sudden have found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3242s) enthusiasm in their hundreds to travel around the country to hand out how to vote. What's the quid pro quo there? What is going on there? We have in the Labor Party a...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3255s)

Which then led to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church website being forced to make a response, which I might add, they've since deleted because they, in their delusion, thought that this nice approach and stand-up tactics at polling booths would have worked, it, alongside of Australians being very afraid of what was happening in America, happening there, it pushed such a landslide to a victory for what we call [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3285s) Labour team that we've never had before.

And everybody, media outlets included, NPMs, attributing to this mass onslaught from an affiliation with a cult, and we've had it even reported on since that head officials within the campaign trail within the team that the exclusive brethren wanted to win have come out and left that saying we can't be, we don't want to be a part of this. Yes, it was an organized nationwide stunt.

And then [since](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3315s) the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have removed this, they're quite a snarky response to the Prime Minister which they launched at the same time then they as this was all happening they removed it because well now they've got to try and excuse my French,suck ass to get back up within because they rely so heavily on government funding they rely so heavily on huge government contracts.

And then another thing that I'd like to attribute to the Get-A-Life team they did a very detailed podcast on the [ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3346s) of the cult where funds and money comes in and how it stays within from their own shops to their own schools to their own charities and on doing that podcast you also explained the wealth that is is entrapped in this system which then led to our Australian Taxation Office launching a huge raid and in which they raided the headquarters of the brethren UBT and that and multiple brethren [businesses.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3376s)

And we got a photocopy because one of the girls unknowingly sent it to an outsider of the front cover of the investigation handed to them by the ATO saying “unexplained wealth”. So they are currently being investigated for multiple brethren businesses being raided by the ATO and we know this too by like me doing a Tik Tok on it, somebody would DM, go:

 “Oh my God I work with somebody in Wollongong and we were raided by the ATO we were wondering what's going on” and today it's still going on and I know that from DMs again saying “We're being, you know, currently investigated we're currently being called into question.”

So it's one of the longest raids still ongoing in Australian federal investigations in terms of fraud.

And why some content has greater reach I want to talk about it, because I know it's such an uncomfortable thing to be vulnerable or to be authentic, and everybody doesn't have a problem with that in their mind. But when you go to do it, like, you know, putting a photo of you crying, imagine, I would have a heart attack knowing that all of you had seen a little 2.5 million. So I think once you get past that barrier, I just think to myself, what else have I got to lose? My family, they're already gone.

So I think being vulnerable, being authentic is what connects with people. And it's really hard to explain that to you. And I'm saying this from my perspective, because I didn't grow up with the internet. It's very hard to connect with the younger people, you know, and a wider reach. You are a wider reach. But I think what does, I think, is authenticity [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3476s) being a humble… Another thing is to keep it relevant and relatable. I was talking about fashion in the US and drawing similes with A Handmaid's Tale and dating back to the brethren, these brethren fashion trends.

And again, I didn't expect the reach, between 3 million, 5.4 million views. And then share the small things, and this is what I touched on earlier, things that I thought were just normal, mundane parts of my existence, you know, like, that other people find interesting. So I shared how we used to get our radios taken out, because I saw this car, and I was like, oh, they've had the button blocked, I remember that. And I shared that story, and that had 65,000 views but it was interesting because it had so many shares and so many co-eds from people that used to work in auto electricians that would do that or people that would buy old cars exclusively.

It creates a platform for an environment where everybody can speak freely about something that I thought was boring and then [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3535s) thing was answering questions on small things sometimes you just ignore in the comments, and that was like clothing and that reached 387,000 views. It's the things that you don't think would do well, unfortunately do, like you're crying. Again, sharing the small things. I've seen this a million times. It's quite triggering to look at, but I know everybody else hasn't, and that's the inside of a church hall and then a photo of the layout, the way that people sit in front to back based on your level of importance.

And again, that was a 483K. Three lessons I've learned from three years of advocacy is: 

Your story is worth sharing. People are interested, kind, and always willing to help. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3584s) never underestimate the impact of sharing your story on social media. And that is it. Thank you.

How Get-a-Life got started – the context.

The advent of the internet has been hugely influential in the “propaganda war” between the PBCC and its estranged former members. Websites and blogs critical of the church commenced in the early 2000s and were shut down by legal action and intimidation of the authors. Meanwhile, the PBCC launched their own websites to try and present a positive spin on their position. In the 2010s, public social media such as Facebook provided a safer refuge for critics of the church as these platforms are too large to be intimidated by litigation and they enjoy greater legal protection against [defamation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3649s) claims than do individual websites. There are several Facebook groups of former PBCC members currently, some of which are primarily concerned with exposing illegal and abusive activity by the Church, while others focus more on social and support connections between leavers.

Following the Klondike Papers scandal in Canada, in which connections between leading PBCC members and Canadian politicians were exposed, a number of podcasters and TikTok influencers interviewed former PBCC members and achieved remarkably high viewing numbers. Inspired by this high level of public interest, unprecedented in North America, four former members of the PBCC created the Get-A-Life podcast channel [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3699s) 2022 as a platform for PBCC leavers to tell their stories.

How is Get-A-Life produced?

 A podcast is produced entirely on Zoom, and then edited and broadcast on YouTube. Audio-only versions are also published on Spotify and Apple Podcasts, etc. and video and audio also on general file-sharing platforms where insiders can discreetly download episodes without arousing suspicion. Episodes may be hosted and recorded by team members anywhere in the world, but are edited [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3737s) Canada before publication.

The original format of interviewing PBCC leavers has expanded and we now produce some documentary style podcasts about specific issues or incidents and we also interview Cultic studies experts such as Mike Kropveld and Janja Lalich, and on occasion leavers of other high demand groups such as FLDS to compare their experiences with PBCC leavers. Style [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3768s) very informal. Participants frequently express strong emotions and use strong language as well as humour and satire to convey their feelings.

How is Get-A-Life changing lives?

 I want to take a few minutes to talk about how the Get-A-Life podcast is changing the lives of both the audience and the participants. 

So firstly the audience. 

One part of the audience is current members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian in church. Despite the very real risks, surveillance, punishment, excommunication, many current members are secretly watching the podcast. They're using burner phones, burrowed devices, library computers, whatever they can get their hands on. We know this from direct messages from insiders, as Cheryl shared, and we know it from members who've told us, or we know it from ex-members who've told us, ”I was watching this while I was still inside.” For some of them these episodes were the turning point the moment they knew they had to leave. Especially powerful are the episodes showing former members thriving, living full lives, succeeding, laughing and loving. This flies in the face of the church's fear-based warnings that everyone who leaves will fail. Gives people the courage to make that enormous step.

The other part of the audience is the participants, the former members who come onto the podcast to tell their stories. They're both the audience and the storytellers. How are their lives being changed as a result of participating? First, there's the personal healing. Telling your story out loud in public is very powerful. It's not just cathartic, it's reclaiming your dignity after years of slander and spiritual abuse. Secondly, there's vindication. The PBCC will often spread lies about those who leave, suggesting they were immoral or corrupt or broken.

The podcast gives leavers a public platform to correct that narrative, the opportunity to give their [side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3900s) of the story that was denied them inside the cult. And knowing that insiders are listening makes that all the more powerful. After decades of hurt and pent-up anger, former members can find vindication. Thirdly, there's connection. One of the most beautiful things we've seen is that the podcast is connecting people who might never have found each other. It creates a sense of shared history, a place for mutual support.

Some have gone on to create survivor-led support groups like the ones formed by abuse survivors who now meet regularly on Zoom. Time and again we've seen former members come out of oblivion to tell their story on the podcast, but they don't go back [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3945s) oblivion. They become part of the extended family of former members who share their thoughts and feelings on the various ex-members Facebook groups and other social media.

So how does Get-A-Life impact the PBCC? We know that podcast is very subversive and here's why. Firstly, as we said, it undermines the church's fear tactics. We've been told all our lives, if you leave you'll fail. You'll end up in the gutter, disaster befalls you. But now viewers can see the truth. They see members laughing, travelling, building businesses, raising kids. The “damned” are doing just fine. [Written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=3989s) rebuttals can be dismissed, but seeing is believing. These truths undermine current members' fear of the leadership. And when the fear goes, so does the control.

Secondly, it exposes leadership corruption. We've read testimony and documents about historical abuse, like the Aberdeen scandal in 1970, right through the present-day misconduct, money laundering, financial fraud, sexual abuse. This is information current members are not supposed to see, but they are seeing it, and it can't be unseen. Current members are starting to view their leaders with distrust and suspicion rather [than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4032s) blind obedience.

Thirdly, it's a trusted source of information from mainstream media and research. Journalists come to us, whistleblowers come to us, employees of PBCC businesses and teachers from brethren schools tell us what is going on in the secret sect. Current insiders leak information, documents, recordings, evidence and we use it responsibly to bring the truth to lght. Get-A-Life has [become](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4062s) the most trusted public archive of PBCC abuse, fraud and misconduct information.

PBCC leaders both at the local and the global level now know that if they abuse their power someone is watching very closely and their misdeeds may well become the next episode of the Get-A-Life podcast. Get-A-Life is finally bringing some accountability to the PBCC. 

Now, change of subject, some great new research opportunities. So historically, the PBCC has been very little studied compared to other cultic groups, largely because of the lack of credible sources of information.

The brethren were secretive, closed, and didn't share their ministry publicly. Believers and apostates had few opportunities to publish their experiences and were typically intimidated and reluctant to talk for fear of repercussions in the cult. Some of the most extreme abuse cases made [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4132s) into the press, but that was a very skewed sample. There was no way for a researcher to gain an understanding of the typical daily experiences of ordinary members of the cult. All this has changed. I'll show you now some of the incredible new resources that are open to the academic community.

Firstly, [pbccresearch.com](http://pbccresearch.com). This is a website that is so brand new that it's still steaming from the oven. We've all been working our asses off to get this up and running in time for this conference. So this is, what we've done is we have created transcripts of every single episode of the Get-A-Life podcast. Not me personally, an ex-member who wants to remain anonymous has done an amazing job with AI and technology and he's got [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4193s) of those 137 episodes transcribed and we're still working through like the final edits.

And at this moment I think we've got about 30 of them on this website because one of the things that we, you know, great as Get-A-Life is, once a podcast has been done and it's gone into the past, there's no real way of searching it and remembering or finding all the really good information that's on there. And it's a huge amount of information. By the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4223s) we've got, we hope by the end of the month to have all the episodes loaded on here, that will be about 5,600 pages of leaver’s testimony and two to three hundred hours of audio all in a fully searchable format.

So all of these transcripts can be searched by keyword. Let me demonstrate. So if you wanted to learn about OneSchool Global, say the Brethren's schooling system, you'd put it in the search box and then even though we've only got 30 of the podcast episodes on here, it's come up with 38 results in 11 different files, where each file is a podcast. So, excuse me a moment. So yeah, so here's some more results going down. I mean it's a very very long screen of results just on that one word.

And so take this one for example, this result here, it's in the podcast where we, episode number 24 we interviewed Bradley McCallum and Cheryl is saying “...we're seeing that through the reports of OneSchool Global…” right so this is the from the transcript, now if you click on one of these blue underlined words like this [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4311s) or this word, that actually hyperlinks directly to the original podcast video at that specific time stamp. So take this line here, “...through the reports of OneSchool Global…” if you click here, then that jumps you to Cheryl saying, “...seeing that through the reports of OneSchool Global…, right on the actual video.

So I think that's a really amazing resource for anyone trying to research [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4342s) PBCC because these are not second-hand reports, this is real leavers speaking about their real daily lives, their experiences, and you can search any keyword and come up with, you can actually go direct and hear the person actually talking about it. So the next resource I want to show you is a little more sinister. The Subject Index of the Ministry of B.D. Hales.

So this is what you might call internal cult literature. The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, everything hangs on the word of the Elect Vessel, the Man of God, who's currently Bruce D. Hales. He's been in that position for 25 years and he takes what they call Bible readings and he preaches and they have words for it but everything he says is written down and transcribed and put into little booklets which go out every week to every member [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4405s) they're right up to date, and then those booklets are compiled into fatter volumes and then every ten years or so they publish this incredibly comprehensive index by keyword of everything he's pronounced on, okay, and because they don't really want us to have this, but someone has carefully taken and scanned it all in and turned it into a searchable PDF.

So again if you wanted to research say their schooling system, you put in the [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4435s) “school” and exact matches, 551 incidents of the word “school” and then “schools” and “schooling”. And then when you click on any of these it will take you to, it will take you all the way through the PDF to every place, see this blue highlight here is the word “school”. And in fact, in this case, the 28th incidence of it takes you to a whole section of the index which is about brethren schools.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4465s) this isn't just an index, this is an index where it's actually a whole series of extracts from the ministry. These extracts, these are the actual words of Bruce Hales. So this piece here, he's talking about his father, talking about the schools and that was at a Bible reading in Detroit on Friday the 6th of September 2002 and this number here says you can find, look up that reference in volume 9 and page 99\.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4496s) whereas the whole brethren kind of doctrine and ministry used to be highly secretive it's now incredibly well indexed and you can find out everything that, you know, these are the rules that they're following. 

So finally another great resource which I think Cheryl mentioned before this is, Damian Hastie's a Scottish researcher he kind [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4527s) researched the government corruption he didn't have any connection with the PBCC but he became so intrigued by the massive financial success wealth of the PBCC that he put together an incredible directory, it's a bit of an understatement, encyclopaedia if you like, of the whole Brethren financial institution which is all of their 3,000 or more major businesses and their trusts and their charities.

And [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4557s) this is incredibly searchable. If again you were wanting to research, this is just the opening page, but if you wanted to research OneSchool Global, then there's screens and screens of, not only of the OneSchool Global Trust, but all their various trading arms and fundraising arms. So this is one in Australia. And then if you click on this, it takes you to the details of that specific education trust and you get the names of the [actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4587s) trustees.

And of course, we've also got access to their directories or photo books or whatever, so you can actually identify all these individuals and you can cross-reference them and see which businesses these people own. And of course, one of the big tricks of the PBCC, why they're so financially successful, is that they integrate their businesses and charities, so they get very large government grants which go to their schools and then they spend that money with [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4617s) businesses so they feed the money into their ecosystem where it goes round and round and never comes out again.

You might ask why the details of PBCC businesses and trusts should be of interest to researchers, and the answer is that business and international finance is the very essence of the PBCC. What was once an unworldly Christian sect has been hollowed out over the past 25 years to become a camouflaged shell for a multi-billion dollar corporation. While the PBCC claims to have no [hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4655s) of leadership except that the official position of the Minister of the Lord in the Recovery or Elect Vessel or Man of God, which he calls himself.

Well, in practice it has an extensive caste system of management levels which is entirely predicated on financial success and business ownership. Put simply, one's spiritual standing in the church and influence in church matters is simply a matter of net worth. It's the prosperity [gospel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4686s) taken to extreme. The more money you have, the more spiritual influence you have in the church. Consider that charitable trusts in the PBCC collectively hold over 1.2 billion Australian dollars for their own use, not for public benefit.

This is an incredibly wealthy cult and this is a group with fewer than 55,000 members. If you divided out that 1.2 billion dollars to every [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4716s) member it would be over 22,000 each for every man, woman and child. With all these results as to hand, there's no excuse not to study this extraordinary and highly influential cultic group. Four monographs and 50 to 100 academic papers have been written on the Church of Scientology.

By contrast, there are only about 10 papers on the PBCC, and the only semblance of a monograph is by the notorious cult-apologist Massimo Introvigne, a volume which any respectable library would shelve under science fiction and fantasy. The PBCC is now both numerically larger and very much wealthier than the Church of Scientology. Its practices and doctrines are quite as damaging, sociopathic and strange. But from an academic perspective, it's the great terra incognita.

It's a whole vast continent of sociological mystery just begging to be explored. If you want to make your mark in the field of cultic studies, this is a year of opportunity to explore the great [unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4787s) that is the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. So to make it easy for you we've produced these red leaflets which have got links to those websites and resources and with our contact details so you can reach out to us you can ask for anything from our extensive collection. Please take some leaflets with you from our presentation, take some extra ones and give them to your colleagues. We look forward to a healthy crop of new research papers on the PBCC by the end of the year.

### [**Jill Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4825s)

This is a difficult presentation to give. I don't know how I'm going to be as I give it, so we'll see how it goes but I'm looking at child sexual abuse and these are very preliminary topics about preliminary findings from our research really but I'm going to start with a poem I'm not going to speak, read it out nor is the author, we want you to read it yourselves just because it's a difficult one. So this was written by my newly adopted [daughter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4855s) I'm having to crack jokes because this is kind of difficult. So if you don't mind just reading that, please.

And we will read this out for the listeners on this podcast.

 Unzip My Body by Cheryl Bawtinheimer.

 I want to unzip my body right here, right now, in front of you, in front of the jury, in front of every person who ever asked, are you sure it happened? Why didn't you say something sooner? Do you have proof?

 No, I don't have proof. I have a body that remembers every inch of those hands. I have skin that flinches when the air shifts just [right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4897s) I have a rib cage that tightens like it still knows the weight of silence.

 If you want proof, let me unzip my body. Let me peel back the flesh, reveal the places they touched before I even had words for what they were stealing. Let me show you the ache that lodged itself between my legs before I knew how to say stop. I will show you the truth screaming in my nervous system, the courtroom carved into every tendon, every tremor. 

Don't ask for tidy stories. Don't ask for police [reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4928s) from a time I couldn't spell my own name. Ask my hips why they lock up in the dark. Ask my stomach why it turns when I hear footsteps behind me or change jingling in a pocket. 

Ask my body. It kept the minutes when no one else would. This isn't about believing me anymore. It's about believing in justice. Justice that doesn't wait for a perfect victim or a timestamp photo. It's about holding children like sacred fire. Too precious to risk. Too human [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4958s) doubt. Too valuable to silence.

If I unzip my body, let it spill every unspoken truth, then zip it back up with steel, thread, and fire. It's not to prove myself. it's not for your belief. It's for the one still silent, for the one still hoping someone will listen, for the justice we still haven't seen, for the children who should never have to unzip theirs just to be protected.

### [**Jill Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=4984s)

They’ve been creating what's called Get-A-Life podcasts which they spoke about a couple days ago giving voice to many former members of the and I know that other groups have done the same and I think it's very important to get the voices out there because today I'm touching on things that should never happen to a child. Never. And yet they do. And I have no doubt that in this room today there are people who have had that experience and some of you will also have completed our research and for that thank you.

Child sexual abuse is sadly not new, ( I'm sorry I forgot about that slide, I hate overviews but there it is somebody that wants to know my precious mountains that I might run to at any moment I can.) Child abuse is not new and over and over again we get news articles like these appearing on our screens, on our televisions, in our in-trays. The news is full of stories of abuse. And quite often, they're from people, by people that we thought we could trust. Celebrities, schools, even famous ones like the Yehudi Menuhin School, bishops, archbishops, police, social workers, parliamentarians, and so on.

It's endemic, we find it in mainstream churches Church of England, Roman Catholic Church some Jewish groups [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5088s) of course many instances reported in cultic groups it's quite a serious problem now over the years various Royal Commissions and investigations have been created and published I've mentioned three of them the one in Australia, these are all recent, the one in New Zealand and the Independent Inquiry in the UK was England and Wales. These reports are published, recommendations are made and then nothing happens, nothing changes.

The new survivor still failed years after inquiry and this was the chair of the Independent Inquiry in the UK. So they're being ignored in some level. But to be fair, and I'm always trying to be fair, one of the struggles that Royal Commissions and researchers have is they come up against this issue of definition. What is child abuse? Without a clear single definition, [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5154s) can we even think about prevalence, psychological sequelae and so on?

This paper by Matthews and Colin Vazina kind of rescued me a little bit from the quagmire I found myself in as I read articles about child sexual abuse. I say they rescued me a little bit, they didn't, but they gave me a structure to think about because they looked through research studies, policy documents and legal profession all using different definitions and questions have arisen, does child sexual abuse have to be inflicted by an adult? What is a child? What are the social norms in a particular country? Is that relevant?

Child marriage is accepted in some, isn't it? And so we have these problems of being unable to compare across studies because of this difficulty for the definitions. This is what they came up with. They came up with three dimensions on which the definitions of child sexual abuse vary. I don't have the time to go through this in detail, but I recommend you read the article. So there's the use of the child's age, for example. It's either not stipulated or it varies. Is a child someone under 18, under 17, under 16?

What about the relationship with the child and the abuser? In some cases, some definitions say it's any adult or any child. Others say it could be child on child. Others say the perpetrator has to be at least five years [older.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5258s) And you'll see in a minute why that just does not work. The use of the element of sexual gratification, does that need to be there? Do we need to state that the perpetrator does it for purposes of sexual gratification? But across these three organisations, if you like, these three domains, they vary.

The second dimension was about the acts that constitute child sexual abuse. So some have a long list of 12, others only have four. We have it in the middle because we have eight. Do the [acts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5292s) have to be about contact with a child or can it be non-contact like making the child watch porn for example? The third dimension is the whole issue of consent. Does that need to be in the definition and if so how do we define it? We're talking about children, not adults.

I'd love to go more into that but I simply don't have the time. But the definition that I kind of am leaning towards at the moment is this one by the WHO. The involvement of any child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend is unable to give, therefore, informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot, therefore, give consent, or [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5343s) violates the laws of say social taboo in society which takes it out away from the child but I have a slight issue with that one.

I know she was kind of really getting ahead, now I'm not so happy with that because I think that is open to interpretation but this is the, this is an important thing. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, [trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5375s) or power. And that's important for our research, we'll see why in a moment. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child defines a child as being under 18\. Unfortunately I didn't see that before we created the questionnaire but sorry we said under 16 but I think actually most people ignored it.

If we turn to prevalence, so I can't solve the problem of definition, I'm afraid, it's difficult to establish because of the definitional differences that I've mentioned, because of the different ways that it's assessed across the study. So some studies do it by interview, some do it by self-administered questionnaires, or maybe a mixture of both. There is a lack of data about characteristics of CSA, what is it, how old do the perpetrators need to be and so on.

Official records provide us with incidence rates but they are based only on the recorded cases and therefore are not going to give the full picture and quite often they're over a restricted timeframe, for example a year, and prevalence rates are largely derived from retrospective self-reported accounts, which are not necessarily problematic, but they can be. Actually, I need to do a whole session just on this, don't I? It is a very confusing picture.

But I found three meta-analyses, and there you can see the ranges. They're just kind of all over the place, aren't they? I'm going to focus just on Stoltenberg et al. It's their measure analysis, they reviewed 331 studies published between 1980 and 2008\. That combined gave them 1 million participants. So I don't know how they came up with 8% for males or 18% for females. I need to kind of dig a bit deeper into the paper. But it does at least give us a little bit of a starting point for comparison.

So, but the problem is that we have, you know, we've done this study on child sexual abuse. We've got percentage of people who are reporting it. Without knowing what the prevalence is in the general population, how can we compare? The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse wrote this, my men will ask me to read it because my throat is giving out, or perhaps I should read.

 “It's difficult to imagine what it feels like to be silenced or dismissed when trying to tell somebody you've been sexually abused.This happens so often to victims and survivors that many gave up trying to report what had and that is why the Truth Project, designed to enable victims and survivors to share their accounts in a confidential setting, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5565s) such a vital part of the enquiries' work. And why victims and survivors' voices represents a cornerstone of enquiries, analysis and recommendations. Nearly 6,200 victims and survivors contributed to the Truth Project, and for some it was the first time they had spoken about the child sexual abuse they had suffered.”

And that links kind of quite nicely with the podcasts that are going out, the Get-A-Life podcasts, podcasts by other former members because [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5595s) all giving a voice to the survivors. You can get a copy of the slides afterwards, I don't think you've got to write them down. They went on to say, the red bit there, 

“What marks religious organisations out from other institutions is the explicit purpose they have in teaching right from wrong. The moral turpitude of any failing by them in the prevention of or response to child sexual abuse is therefore heightened.”

And then this final bit,

“Freedom of religion and belief can never justify or excuse the ill-treatment of a child or a failure to take adequate steps to protect them from the crime.”

 The other thing that IICSA, which is actually pronounced ICSA, so it's a bit confusing, is they looked at the barriers to reporting, and there's a list of them. And they're fairly obvious ones, really. Victim-blaming, the whole shame and honour thing, a lack of discussion of sex and sexuality within cultic groups, the abuse of power by religious leaders, which of course, because they're mostly men you get this gender disparity.

The mistrust of external agencies is a very important [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5681s). I think it's kind of fostered by the leaders of the cultic group because they know that external agencies have the power to expose them. The whole issue of forgiveness is another big one. You know the child does report to child for sexual abuse, the elders or whoever speak to the perpetrator, the perpetrator solves and says I'm really sorry so then they have to forgive them and it's not reported to the authorities.

Fear of being disbelieved that's very common I think in child sexual abuse and the fear of being excluded and ostracized by their communities and that again the cultic group is very pertinent because you are at risk of losing all your family and friends and everything that you've ever known. And of course because children are not reporting it and because the organisations are not reporting it, the prosecution rates are very low. So very few child sexual abuse cases actually get to court.

With regards to safeguarding policies, this study also reported that in the UK there is no legal obligation for religious organisations to follow the guidance of the Child Protection Department. Well, however, just before this conference, there is currently a bill, I think, going through the Houses of Parliament, and I came across a speech by Sam Carling, the Labour MP for North West Cambridgeshire. He has to be [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5774s) an ex-JW, so it's really close to his heart. And I'm going to contact him when I get back because he's quite clearly wanting amendments to the Act to make sure that when it does go through, if and when it does go through, it actually really does safeguard the children in these groups.

So let's have a look to see what we found. But unfortunately, I have to give a disclaimer to start with. Back in 2014, I did a similar study looking just at former members of the Brethren. 27% of the sample reported child sexual abuse and I made it clear then and I'm reading this I make it clear now that I did not and would not extrapolate from that sample to all former members of the Brethren nor would I [ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5828s) extrapolate and generalise to the current members of the Brethren.

Unfortunately, attempts were made by the Brethren lawyers to state that I did make those claims, which I regard as defamatory, because I'm a professional researcher. I don't make wild claims like that. 

Design and methodology, you've probably seen this slide before, either last year or the year before or even yesterday, but the important one here is this child sexual victimisation questionnaire, which is part of the package. We've got five clinical measures of distress and five measures of group experience, and I can see that Google Docs has messed up the EDL formatting there, never mind.

Criteria for participants over the age of 18, they're fairly kind of self-evident, we do actually have a control group but unfortunately we don't have enough people in it yet so that's our next goal so that we can at least have a comparison group. Interestingly they came from 62 different countries and they've been in 150 different groups so as you can imagine some of the cell sizes for each group [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5911s) too small for us to actually do much with at the moment.

So if you haven't done the research yet please do it please put your name and address there and I can send you the link. We ended up, well at the moment we've got 1,162 participants. Now to explore all of this because first of all the overall percent of people out of about 1,162 the percentage was 54.3% of reported child sexual abuse. Now it doesn't matter which rate you took from that meta-analysis I showed you that is …. However, who were the perpetrators?

Were they members of the group or were they strangers or were they teachers, doctors, who? So we started filtering the cases down. We started out with 1,162 of those 631 reported child sexual abuse. We then asked, was the perpetrator a member of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=5974s) group? And 379 said yes. So now we've got 32.5%. It's not that I'm disregarding the others, it's just that we're interested specifically in people who have been influenced by a member of the group.

But then for some reason we found 19 people who are actually claiming to be first generation adults. Now either that's not true and maybe they're teenagers who joined independently perhaps. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6004s) that's something we need to drill down into to find out who those 19 people are that have said they're first-generation adults because... Could they be both? Can I take questions at the end? Sorry. Because otherwise I lose my thread. Yeah, that was the question. They could be both. If they joined in their teenage years independently, they were then first-generation, but yeah.

So we would be conservative here. So we screened the FGAs out and we've ended up with 360 participants. So that's the group that we're now looking at. So how are they distributed amongst the groups? Not all the groups are listed for the reasons I've said. I mean, we've only got nine Moonies, ex-Moonies I should say. But the three key groups are the Exclusive Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons because the sample sizes for those three groups are large enough for us to do comparisons with.

So let me just make sure you've understood this table.  89 of the ex-Exclusive Brethren reported child sexual abuse that's 41% of the total sample which is 216\. So we have 216 former members of the brethren in the total sample of whom 41% are reporting child sexual abuse. All right that's the same with all the others. So the percentages are all fairly high Moonies we can't really focus on much because there's only nine of them anyway.

 Right, these are the eight acts that I referred to earlier that we listed and asked people, have you ever experienced these acts?

So obviously people were responding more than once, if you see what I mean. Some people claimed that all, not claimed, reported, but all eight, they've experienced all eight of those acts. Yeah? And look at the percentages. I mean, you know, you look at that and you think, this abuse is systemic. This is not something small or minor to sort of think, oh, well, never mind. But who were the perpetrators? We know they're members of the group, but who were they actually? And here we have one of these colours. I've forgotten I've done this.

One group, the neighbours and friends of parents, 21% say that perpetrator was a neighbour or a friend of parents. If you group the leaders together, 19% were abused by leaders. Then you add in other members of the cultic group, 43%. Now obviously the relatives down here are also members of the group, so they may have endorsed that one as well. So, but if you look at the relatives, that [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6181s) the highest percentage. I can't remember what it is. Add it up quickly, someone call me. Oh, 53%, that's it. Yes. But you see that the professionals, it's very low. So hallelujah, no we don't say that, because even 1% of a professional is 1% too many.

How old were these children when they were abused? Were they little children or not? We gave them a range and if you add the 10 years and under we have 63% were abused as little children. That statistic for me is very difficult to read and hear. Although very early on in our analysis we did decide to look at those three groups I highlighted a moment ago. So the Exclusive Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons and this is when I realised something strange is going on.

If you look at the Exclusive Brethren, 42% of these victims were 10 years or under. More were over the age of 10\. But they're look at the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons the trend is reversed and I don't, I mean I don't know how many in this room know about chi square and probability but a probability of less than 0.001 means that the probability of the chance of getting these results just by some random method right like when you throw a dice that's random, this is not random that's what that probability means, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6288s) there's something going on here but we need to go back to.

How much older was the perpetrator? Remember the WHO definition that said he doesn't have to be or she doesn't have to be five years or older? They can be the same age. If we had followed the definition that said the perpetrator has to be five years or older we would not have picked up that 36% of children who are actually abused by people the same age or a little bit older than that. Which I find quite shocking in a way. Let's look at the three groups again. Look at the numbers, same thing happens.

In the brethren, the perpetrators, more of them are less than five years older than the child that they're abusing whereas the other two groups are the other way around and once again this finding is highly significant. There's a lot of work for us to do yet. I'll try and work out why that was. This is not particularly remarkable because we had twice as many women as men in the sample, so you would expect more male perpetrators, but I don't know what the figures are for male versus female perpetrators, but anecdotally we know that there are more male than female, right?

How long did it happen? How long, over what period of time did it happen? So was it just a one-off? Or did it occur over all these different time frames? For 43% of the sample, the child sexual abuse, so these two, went on for a year or more. So we're not talking about something that happened one day and then never happened again, are we? We're talking about something that is really systemic in these groups. And if you take six months or more, that goes up to 52%. The figures are actually quite shocking.

If we cluster those a bit and look again at our three groups, this time there are no differences, but it may be something about the way I've clustered the time periods, right? Those small differences you can see are not significantly different. But, you know, this is preliminary work. We may find something later on. We then asked, which of the following is the main reason? Now, obviously, there are several reasons, but why did that person experience it? And the highest one is this one, another person used because of their authority, 31%.

But these are all about threats aren't they? These ones down the bottom here, the ethical approval committee were kind of a little, really? But they let us leave it there. But you know, just because you liked it doesn't make it right. And actually, glancing at the data myself, without properly analysing it, it looks like these three are mostly children who are above 10 years of age. So they're more sexually aware. Or maybe, you may. Did they talk about the abuse at the time? Only 20% did. Did you ever seek professional help? Only 35% did.

That's in line with findings elsewhere. Let's look at our groups. You notice something strange? Look at that. Only 7% of the exclusive brethren of former members talked about it at the time compared to 22 and 30 percent of the others. Again this is highly significant and again we find differences among those that sought professional help. So what is going on? We wondered if it was something to do with a relationship but the brethren have with the group that might be different [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6578s) the way the members of JWs or Mormons might have.

So we took the trauma coerced attachment scale, which is a fairly new scale, only two or three years old, we developed it at Salford. And it measures the extent to which the person feels attached to their group and feels obliged to be loyal to them. So we're asking here, are the brethren more dramatically [attached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6608s) to their group than the other? And just eyeballing those mean scores there, it looks like they are, because the higher the score, the more attached you are. And that did, it was significant.

This was done with the Kruskal-Wallis, which you should ee at the bottom, but it doesn't. And what that scale produces is this wonderful diagram. So you see the three groups, and the blue lines are the important ones. The numbers are the mean rounds, for anybody that knows the Kruskal-Wallis. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6639s) a non-parametric and this one shows that the former exclusive brethren are scoring significantly higher than the JWs and significantly higher than the Mormons but the difference between the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses is not significant so there's no real difference between those two it's the brethren that are standing out as different.

Who found out at the time? If anyone did, which is similar to the previous question, but we're trying to look at who it was that they talked to. And you can see that it's the parents and another member of the group, if they talked at all. Not the police, not the doctors, not the therapists, not the teachers, which kind of underlines that mistrust of external agencies, doesn't it? The, oh sorry, yes, have you tried to report this abuse as an adult? 17% said yes, but only 9%, in only 9% of cases did that actually result in legal or disciplinary action. It's just such a sad story.

Now the IICSA came up with these seven domains in which victims of child sexual abuse can be harmed. We're [focusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6729s) on the emotional well-being. We may be able to get, we can get into interpersonal relationships another time and religious and spiritual beliefs now. So we used the International Trauma Scale to assess PTSD and CPTSD. This yields two scores. One is that you've met the criteria or not, so it's categorical, yes or no, and the other is a kind of a score that adds all your responses up [together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6759s) Okay? Hope that makes sense.

And we found that of the sample that we have at the moment, 360, 59% met the diagnosis of PTSD and 76% met the diagnosis of complex PTSD. Okay, but then what's the percentage in the rest of our sample? Well, before I come to that, let's look at the groups again. I'm quite surprised by this that the Exclusive Brethren percentages are lower than the other two. Don't really know why at the moment. The probabilities appear not as highly significant as before.

And if we look at our clever diagram, oh hang on, can I go back? Yes. Oh, this is the people that met the diagnosis, that's right. So, yeah, okay, so they are slightly different, but it's not highly significant. But then if you look at the actual total score from the PTSD questionnaire, the Brethren score seems to be lower than the other two's, doesn't it? The total score. So this is also significant, the fact that the Exclusive Brethren participants or lower than the other two is significant.

And if we look at that clever diagram, that clever triangle, you can actually see that the significance is only between the Exclusive Brethren and the Jehovah's Witnesses. So the Jehovah's Witnesses seem to be getting a much higher mean rank score than the other two, but the only significant [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6859s) is the one with the Exclusive Brethren. So something needs to be done with that, which I'm trying to work it out. Right, so then we created two groups. One was our child sexual abuse group. The other was the remainder of the total sample who were not first generation adults.

So we took them out on the grounds that they couldn't experience child sexual abuse in the group. I know there's a slight anomaly there somewhere. So we then looked at, sorry this is really condensed because I needed two papers not one. We looked at the distribution of symptom checklist 90 which is quite a well-known scale for measure for distress, the inventory of interpersonal problems, the Wessex dissociation scale, the PTSD score and the DSO. The DSO is the complex PTSD score. They're all significantly [higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6925s) in the child sexual abuse grouping.

So clearly the child sexual abuse survivors are the people that are driving those scores up. They really have experienced a huge amount of distress. I personally feel that we need a working party on this, a global one, who can look at the situation worldwide and be a force to make the change and maybe ICSA can be behind that driving force. I don't mean the [IICSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNCkXcb2Rm4&t=6955s) now, I'm talking about Cultic Studies. So I did create a summary. I think my time is over, but maybe I could leave that up there while we see if there are any questions.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
