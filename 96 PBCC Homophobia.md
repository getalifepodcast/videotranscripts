## Summary

This a powerful and honest podcast of what it is like if you are born gay in the PBCC. Craig, Ben, Fritz & Paul, Stephane, Ross, Jacky, Gilli, and Abi navigate a taboo subject that is dealt with in very extreme measures in the PBCC. We know the PBCC is very archaic in their understanding of being born gay, but what will it take for them to realize this problem they have is not going away? The team went through Fritz's t-shirt he wore to a pride march that had multiple slogans written on it. Everything that was written on it was said to him by the PBCC. Ben goes through his Instagram posts that had graphic homophobic comments from Steve Hales' grandson and gives a brief update on his death threat he received.
The breakthrough they all had after leaving was finding the support, love, and acceptance they never got inside. Breaking free from the narratives, brainwashed into them, was found during meet ups, LGBTQ group activities, and realizing how twisted the PBCC use the bible scriptures. Most of all, THEY ALL want to help those stuck inside that are in the same position they were in.
At the end of every podcast, there are helplines for those inside to reach out to, and everyone here is reachable on social media or at info.getalife@proton.me
Your freedom awaits you! Don't deny yourself the possibility of fully living your life.

## Transcript

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=12s)

Hello everyone, welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I'm here today with my friends Ross and Craig and Fritz and his partner Paul and Ben and Gilli. There's quite a few of us here tonight. We specifically want to have a chat this evening about homophobia amongst the PBCC people.

How you guys that have had to face this and come through it and find a life on the outside have managed this. I thought I would start by sharing some of the things, Fritz, I know that once you wore a T-shirt to a Pride March and on it you had some slogans that were things, if I remember correctly, you were told by the PBCC when you told them you were gay. Is that correct? So if I read these out, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=66s) one of, yeah, one of the first ones on the top of the t-shirt, we can put a picture of this afterwards, was "The Devil tricked you into thinking you are gay." I was going to throw that out and tell us about that one, and maybe the others can comment too.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=80s)

Yeah, so this is an interesting one. This came from my uncle. All of these were on emails, various emails from family members. Yeah, that first comment was from my uncle after I'd emailed him just purely to ask how the family, his wife was, because he was a family.

And then he went into this whole barrage of the Devil thing, tricking into you're gay, and it's just quite ironic because I went straight back to him and said, "Well, you've spent like, ever since I'm mid-teen, you've called me gay this and gay that and you're acting gay," all the rest of it. And all of a sudden when I'm in a different situation, it's all turned around. It's the Devil that's tricked you into thinking you're gay. It's just all very, yeah, he didn't respond to that obviously because he didn't come back. So yeah, it was [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=130s) a bizarre way of him trying to bend his homophobia.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=136s)

Yeah, yeah, exactly. And to make you, and did any of the others of you have this sort of, "Well, the Devil's tricked you, it's the Devil in you," and so on?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=146s)

Cast out the demons, yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=152s)

Sorry Craig, that was what?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=154s)

Cast out the demons.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=155s)

That was the one you were told, was it? Yeah. Ben?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=158s)

I think they were very confused when I came along because I think they knew I was gay but then were like, "Hang on, he seems to be okay with it. This is not how it works." I didn't really have, I was put straight in touch with Bruce Hales. Like, it wasn't anyone, the person I confessed to, he didn't know what to do. And he told me afterwards that I was the first person he had ever known, like he'd never dealt with anybody that was gay. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=188s) Bruce Hales just gave me a list of four points where it was like, "The Lord has been into manhood, so He knows what you're going through and He can overcome everything."

And I mean, I had a very analytical, question-everything brain. I was like, "What? So he was gay at one point?" And then another point was, "More people in the Brethren that have overcome it than those that have left." And I believed that. And then just a couple of other points that were like, "You know, the Lord can help with everything." But I'm like, "Yeah, no, you know, that's not going to happen. I know it's not happening."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=218s)

So it comes back to the basic belief that I think all of you, because all of you have done personal podcasts where you've talked at some length about your experiences of what you had to face within the Brethren, but it comes back to the point is, being gay cannot happen. That's it. That's their stance, it seems to be, doesn't it? The second point, Fritz, I think on your t-shirt, this one made me laugh because, yeah, well, we'll talk. "You are fulfilling lust and justifying your actions under the guise of [Christianity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=248s)." It cannot be. I mean, what made me, where did that one come from?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=254s)

Yeah, again, it was in a flurry of various emails. So when I first came out and yeah, that's all they think it is. It's just, they think it's just a laugh and that's all it is. And that's partly why I wanted Paul to be here today, to show that actually you can come out and you can have a normal, if you call it normal, relationship. And it's just a very normal life, same as everyone else. It's not some great exciting, you know, it's...

Yeah, and then I think the "justifying your guise of Christianity" thing was because I always ended my emails about, you know, "we're praying for you" and the rest of it, and they just didn't like it because obviously we couldn't be praying for them. That should be the other way around.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=300s)

It should be the other way around. Yeah, yeah. And I think you're absolutely right, Fritz. It's a love between two human beings has no end, does it? It's, why does it matter whether it's male, female, or whatever? It's love and relationship between two human beings, isn't it?

And then the next one that you had on your t-shirt, which is, "It is the lie of the Devil to think you can't be cured." Now Craig, you would have quite a lot of experience of trying to be cured, I think you said in your personal podcast, didn't you?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=332s)

Yeah, they, Bruce Hales referred me to two different Brethren doctors to try and be cured. First of all, the infamous Roger Kirkpatrick, who wanted to know if I was sexually attracted to one of my local priests, which was a very strange thing to be asking when it was all supposed to be on a spiritual level. And then, of course, Mark Craddock in Sydney, who prescribed hormonal suppressants that would usually be used for sex offenders or people with prostate cancer.

And what was concerning to me was that Mark Craddock said that he had been experimenting with other forms of treatment on other young gay people in the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=373s)

Wow.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=373s)

And yeah, for me, that's why it's so important that all of us keep speaking up because there are so many people still in there that are still being treated like this. Yeah, yeah. Interesting you mentioned that, that Mark Craddock, you know, I wondered why he had such a fascination, apart from being the only doctor in there. I had a very close family member of his reach out to me who is also gay, and I was just like, "Your dad, you know, was happy to prescribe this for everyone else." Anyway, it was a very interesting [change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=403s) of history, you know, like when he reached out, I was just like, "Oh my God, like…you did this to so many other people and you had your own son that openly was gay. Apparently, people knew he was gay. He used to bring his partner to the meetings. Yeah, it was interesting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=420s)

But he was there trying to cure others. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=425s)

And I think my point in all that is the projection that you'll see come up a lot in over this topic of homophobia of the Brethren not liking gays, and it usually comes from the most vocal, which is the person that hates the most. Like, I think we can all attest to being homophobic at one point because we didn't like what we saw within ourselves. We're uncomfortable with that. And you see that a lot even in the gay community still. You know, you've got gays that are uncomfortable with their feminine side, so we'll be like, "Well, I'm not quite that gay," or "I'm a masc gay." I'm, you know, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=456s) it doesn't matter what gay you are, at the end of the day, you're still gay. And yeah, I think it's really important to, you know, the projection that comes from that, it's actually from within. You know, sit down and be comfortable with those parts of you, so then you're not hating on a more feminine gay, you're not hating on a less masculine gay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=474s)

Yeah, yeah. And I think too, that's absolutely right. It's the old adage, isn't it, almost, "to accuse is to excuse." And I do sometimes wonder, and I don't know if any of you that have experienced homophobia in the Brethren would have an opinion on this, that those that shout loudest probably do so for a reason.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=495s)

Yeah, yeah, no, I attest to that. And it's, to be honest, it's the same out here, I think. Definitely. Those who are not honest about it are probably homosexual themselves, or trans, or bi, or you know, on the spectrum. So yeah, but I was going to say, for me, the way the Brethren tried to cure me, so I was obviously going to AA meetings, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=525s) they were frowned upon and stopped. And I came out as gay to my two local priests, and they immediately said, "Oh yeah, you can start going back to the AA meetings because we think it will turn you straight."

So that was their way of trying to cure me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=544s)

Wow, yeah, yeah. So that was their cure for you. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=549s)

You often do find they have like, don't you think Ross, quite a medieval almost perspective on knowledge when it comes to the cure of homosexuality. Like, I remember with my mum having a conversation when she caught me in a bookshop. I was trying to hide a DNA, like a soft porn magazine, basically a DNA men's magazine behind a garden magazine, and she came up and it dropped and she found it and she was like, "What's this?" Anyway, I had a conversation later that night with her in the laundry and she's like, "No, no, if I knew, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=579s) would have made you have that operation." So little innocent 16-year-old me is like Googling for the next four years this operation, and all I could come up with was that in the 60s, 70s, where they used to do lobotomy, that was a common practice on homosexuality.

So my mum would prefer me to be a vegetable opposed to a human being that couldn't, you know, couldn't pick their sexuality because we can't. I just, I often think that their knowledge, and that's obviously a direct result of how controlled they are in terms of access to the wider community and knowledge, is very what you're taught. So, you know, well, my mum probably learned that from her parents that lobotomy was a thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=622s)

Yeah, it's quite an interesting point, actually, Ben, because I'll come back to your t-shirt in a minute, Fritz. But one thing you said there was about, you know, you are gay. And this is a message, I think, that is important to get across to people in the Brethren, and I think all of you could help with this. Being gay is not something you choose. And I know that's a very basic thing, but I think if you were in the Brethren and you were worried about your sexuality, you may think, "I'm letting the Devil in, I'm choosing this." [What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=652s) would you say to anybody that's feeling like that at the moment?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=659s)

Anyone want to go first? Actually, first and foremost, you're not alone. Any one of us that have left can attest to the same thing. At that point in time and back there where you were, I too did not want to be gay. I wanted to be straight. I wanted everything that my uncles and brothers and whatever else had and experienced in terms of sticking a photo, you know, of your girlfriend beside your bed because that's what my uncle did and I thought it was cool. You know, I, yeah, you're not alone. But you can get to a stage, like I'm seven years out now, and I love that I'm gay. I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=692s) have children. I can do what I want, go where I want. I even have probably more money than my straight friends because kids are expensive. I mean, you can have kids if you want.

But, yeah, it's just, I love that I'm gay. I love that part of me, and I think that's the part that's helped me get over everything else, you know, the trauma of growing up in a toxic cult. I don't know what you guys think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=713s)

I think that's great, Ben, that you do feel like that because I think it's lovely when you've come to that. But I also know that others struggle with a bit more with actually accepting themselves as they are. And I get that totally. So there's, you know, what do the others think? Fritz?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=730s)

It's difficult, isn't it? Because when you're in the environment, it's near impossible to accept yourself for who you are because you've got all these very glaringly obvious messages coming at you, and sometimes unconscious messages. And without what you're brought up with as well, with the, you know, the slurs that they use and that kind of thing. When you're in that and watch these podcasts, listen to people, listen, talk about their experiences, see that people can fall in love like anyone else, you realize it actually is, you know, you accepting yourself actually makes you more of a genuine [human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=772s) being than you ever could be.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=775s)

I've not been part of the Brethren, but I was part of the charismatic, ultra-right-wing extremist church, and I was forced to get married when I was 20, and then I had four children with my wife. Two years ago, my wife knew I was gay before we even got married, and we believed that God would heal me on my honeymoon night, and when I had the kids, I'd get more and more straight, but it didn't. 14 years I was married. And then after 14 years, I remember Saturday morning, Sarah woke up and said, "I need a man. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=805s) need a man. It's not happening." And I literally prayed.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=809s)

And you were like, "So do I."

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=810s)

Yes, exactly. That's what she said. She said, "You need a man too. It's not happening here." But we, our church was like, I went through conversion therapy twice, two and a half grand each time to be converted from gay to straight, and it just was ridiculous. And I ended up feeling suicidal and feeling like God hated me, when in fact God didn't hate me. God had chosen me at 16 years old. I became a Christian in this church, and I loved Jesus, but the church were like, "You [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=840s) love Jesus if you're gay." And I'm like, "I do love Jesus. I am gay." And it took me a long time. I was 32, and at 35, I was finally kicked out, disfellowshipped as they call it. And Sarah and I are still very close, and Sarah loves Fritz, and my kids love Fritz. It's, you know, God has got, whatever you believe, but we have a very positive family relationship, a very blended family in this day and age, which is amazing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=866s)

I think that's so beautiful to share. 

**Jacky Hart**

That is, I think that's really lovely, Paul. I agree, Ben, it's beautiful because I think that's something we want to get across, that if you find love, and whether you're gay, straight, whatever you are, essentially that's what most people are looking for, aren't they? Yeah. And if you find, and that's something I think I want to get, we'd want to get across to people. And I think your experiences inside the church that you belong to, Paul, would probably resonate with a few people that have left the Brethren too. I know there's [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=898s) that have married and then left in later years because they were gay. And maybe there's people in there feeling they should get married because that would cure them of their gayness, if that's, you know, because that's what they're told. And it isn't going to, is it?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=912s)

No, it's really lovely to hear too that that blended family story because often, and I think I speak for a lot of kids that I've helped leave that are gay in my community, and I think that often the perception or the understanding or the knowledge of gay is synonymous with pedophilia. And I wanted to bring that up because it was something that I carried as a fear of why I didn't like the gay in me until I realized that, hang on, no, it's not. And I think the [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=942s) that woke me up was the day that my grandpa took me for a walk when Bruce Hales told my family that I was gay.

My grandpa took me for a walk and wanted to know how and what turned me, and was it the animals having sex at my uncle's farm that made me gay, watching that? And it was in that moment I realized, no, no, they have a really backward, uneducated view of homosexuality or the queer community. So they are one of the most safest communities. And I just loved that you shared, you know, the trust of your wife, or your ex-wife, and Fritz and kids, and it's just a normal part of society. And it just unlocked that memory, and I thought I need to share that [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=980s) in there, you do struggle with the fact that you are as bad and as evil and as toxic as a pedophile, when in fact it's the opposite. They're not even linked at all. There's no, there's nothing in scientifically to prove that or any case ever. So I think it's really important if you're struggling with that in there because you don't want to accept that part of you because all your life you've been taught that that is the case. It's not, and we can all attest to that. Yeah, I just think it's a really important thing because I used to really struggle with that part of it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1010s)

I think that is important, Ben. It's not on the same level as pedophilia or anything like that. At all.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1015s)

And in fact, you've probably got somebody at your local supper meeting that the Brethren are, you know, which we hear of all the time, are, you know, supporting, and, "Well, he's confessing." I'm like, "Yeah, but he's still raping the child," you know, like...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1027s)

Yeah, and it, sorry Ross, go on.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1031s)

I'm just gonna go back a bit and say I think we've probably all felt when we're in there, you know, it would have been far easier if we had been born straight, you know, because we'd live a middle-class life, we'd be looked after from cradle to the grave, you know, we'd have a nice life. And why would we go out, leave everything, leave our families, leave everything? You know, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do.

You know, why, why would we do that?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1065s)

I think that's absolutely right. Well, it reminds me of a conversation I had with a work colleague, nothing to do with the Brethren, who is gay. But he comes from the Indian community, which also is very difficult for him to tell his mother when he's gay. And I remember him telling me, he said to his mother, "It's far, it would be far easier for me to be like my brothers and be straight. Why would I choose to make my life more difficult? I don't choose it. It's me. It's how I am. This is me." And I think that's the point, isn't it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1095s)

Yeah. I mean, my mum said to me after I left, you know, "Oh, you know, why, you know, obviously you left because you're gay."

And she said, "You know, is it just a phase you're going through?" And I said, "No." I said, "It's, it's, you know, it is who I am."

And that's when I said to her, I said, "You know, I'd have done anything to have been born straight. You know, I would have, you know, been, I would have stayed in the Brethren. I would have had a really great life."

 Not that I haven't got a great life out here, but you know, I've left my family. I've had to leave my family and everything. Do you think that's something that I chose to do? It's not. It's something that I had to do because, to be quite blunt, I was driven to suicide. So it's something that had to be done.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1144s)

That's something that came up in Jenny's podcast that came out this week, wasn't it? She's really resonated with me in her letter or email to her parents when she came out, when she left. And it's exactly the same thing as I said, it's like, "Why would I even have chosen this? It makes my life way worse, [leaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1162s) family, having all that trauma." It wouldn't make sense for me to choose it. It's just, it's just a bizarre concept.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1169s)

Yeah, yeah. And we know that anyway from science, don't we? It's not, you know, it's not a choice. It's the way, as much as my hair is brown from a bottle, admittedly, but you know, that's the way you, the way you're made, isn't it?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1185s)

That's it, right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1185s)

To go back to your t-shirt, yeah, there's a lot there, Ben, I can assure you. Just, yeah. Go back to your t-shirt. The next one, yeah, actually the next one, actually, I think, the next phrase you put on there that you were told, I think, I don't know if it might have been specifically because you were gay you were told this, so maybe you could put it into context for us. But you said, "You will end up with no friends, no food, no money, only darkness."

That's a phrase or those types of words. Could you put that into context for us?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1220s)

Yeah, so this was because I'm gay and I knew that it wouldn't, you know, there was no chance of me ever carrying on in there. So, all of this was pointed at the fact that, you know, if I carried on with this, what they call their, what they call a lifestyle, chosen lifestyle. But it's a very well-peddled phrase that they use, isn't it, with anyone, whether you're gay or anyone that leaves, you end up with nothing. It's something that they've gone in contact with, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1253s) contact with recently, who recently left. It's, they literally use the same language. And it's the whole fear-finance-family thing, isn't it? It's why people stay in. It's what keeps people in sometimes.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1265s)

It's that whole motivation of fear.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1267s)

Stay with that.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1268s)

If you come, if you fear, if you're made to fear, fear keeps you in, controlled, utterly. I remember taking Fritz to a pub in where we live, where we lived in Winchester, this beautiful little village called Stockbridge. It's like, very posh. And I took him to a pub there. We walked into this pub, everyone was white, middle-class English people, and Fritz's immediate response was, "Where are the prostitutes? Where are the drug dealers? Are they going to kill me if I go to the toilet?" I'm like, "We're in, we're in [Stockbridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1298s), you know, we're not in some seedy ghetto." But yeah, and his fear was so prevalent because he'd come out and everyone out here was going to kill him, I was going to kill him, the other members of the gay community were going to kill him. And then he suddenly, he's, over the years, he's realized, actually, we're the complete opposite of that. And that fear is completely unrealized. It's not, it's not real. But when you're in, when you're inside the Brethren, when the Brethren start coming at you with all their, their [emails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1329s) and their, their media campaigns and the legal campaigns, that fear becomes very real again because fear controls you.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1337s)

I think it's so important having experiences like that where you've got a juxtaposition, right? You are rewriting the narrative. And you know, you might be in the same town like I am, or you might be somewhere else where you're rewriting the experiences that you had foreplayed in your head what would happen to you. And it's like, it's so confronting. You're taken aback, but it's actually the complete opposite. And that's when you, and it can be very disorientating as well. So that's where I think it's very important to be kind and patient with yourself with these [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1367s) know, new experiences you're having. And I always say, like my therapist used to say to me, "How long were you in there? 24 years? Okay, give yourself 24 years to get, you know, right, get on that path."

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1377s)

Absolutely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1377s)

And yeah, I think it's so important. But back up to what you said before, I thought it was really interesting about, you know, "you're gonna..." My dad used to say the same,

 "You're gonna go out there and you'll be alone, and you'll be sitting there, you know, on a day like Christmas when we all get together with family, and you'll be just sitting there alone."

 Firstly, is there a problem with that? I mean, I don't mind just sitting there alone by myself with a bottle of wine. But aside from that, it's not the case. You are [inundated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1407s) with friendships to the point, the more you share your story, to the point where it can be a bit overwhelming, and then you've got to learn things like boundaries. So it's, again, rewriting that narrative. Yes, absolutely.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1419s)

Going back to the bit about no friends, I'd like just to say to people in there, I'm part of a meetup group in Peterborough. There's 800 members of us. And there's probably about 20, 25 of us meet up on a regular basis. So to say you'll have no friends is, you know, I've got more friends out here than I had when I was in there.

And, you know, and being alone, well, Christmas, I went over to a friend's with a couple of other friends, stayed till midnight, and that was probably one of the best Christmases I've ever had. It's just not true at all.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1456s)

No, no. Craig? No, so I was gonna say, and Craig, your experiences of leaving because of being gay, you didn't end up with no friends, no food, no money, only darkness?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1474s)

Bruce Hales told me that being gay was the most empty lifestyle a person could live, and that if I went out into the world, that I would have no friends and that the only people that would have anything to do with me would be other wicked people. And nothing could be further from the truth. And when I left, maybe a good time, but they said that the Brethren were the only place that we would find [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1504s) and acceptance and warmth, and that the world was a cold, hard place. And when I came out into what they call the world, what the rest of us would call normal life, I found the opposite to be true. Like, the world is full of like good people, and the Brethren were the ones that were cold and hard.

 And this was, you know, the rainbow community was one of the most welcoming I'd ever walked into. And this is like, this isn't just a Brethren experience that queer [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1535s) have been mistreated by communities, particularly religious communities, for a very, very long time. And so, you know, it's not just Brethren who know how to step up and support people who have been through these experiences. There's that shared wider experience. And so, you know, the love and acceptance and support that I found in the rainbow community blew my mind away. It was sort of much better than anything the Brethren had ever offered with all their strings attached.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1565s)

And I think, as I've said before in podcasts, one of the biggest gifts you can give somebody is to allow them to truly be themselves. But speaking as people who have struggles because you are perceived as being different, well, in the Brethren, as we say, being gay is not accepted. How has that compared with the, and I'm thinking of somebody inside who might be struggling with their sexuality, how has it been accepted out here compared with how you were accepted in the Brethren?

I know the answer, but just try and explain it. I mean, I know what the answer is, but yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1599s)

Well, it's like Craig says, you know, it's not only the rainbow community out here that will accept you. You're just accepted for who you are. I mean, you tell somebody you're gay and they're sort of like, "Yeah, and, you know, what's the problem?" Yeah.

So yeah, you're far more accepted out here. And also, you know, I'd like to touch on, you know, how people will help you as well, which is something that you don't get in there. When I was leaving, I was obviously going down to AA. I've mentioned this before quite a few times, I was going down to AA in London and I was sure I'd just been withdrawn from.

So I'd got to get out of my parents' house, basically. And I was sharing that I didn't have anywhere to go and what was going on. And after one of the meetings, one of the chaps came up to me and just said, "Right, I've got a room you can have, free of charge, for as long as you need it until you get back on your feet again." Now, in there, if you have help, it's conditional. They want something in return.

Yeah, help is unconditional, you know. People will help you and they want absolutely nothing in return. So for the Brethren to say, you know, that the help out here is conditional, I'd like to just say switch that right round because it's so not true. You know, just switch it and reflect, and actually, yeah, it's conditional in the Brethren, unconditional out here.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1692s)

Totally. I think watching Fritz as he's come out over the last, everyone once he's out here, we went to one of the first Prides we went to, we met his cousin who also is ex-Brethren, two mums are with him. And the whole of that afternoon, they spent time with Fritz, just giving him that motherly love that he had lost because he's so close to his mum. And his mum is beautiful. Whenever I see her, I want to just hug her and kiss her, but I can't, obviously, because she sees me as bad. And these women, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1723s) and continuously throughout his life since he's been out here, there have been these people, men and women, who've loved him like parents, unconditionally, who just see him as a son, as a beautiful son, when the Brethren said he was not beautiful, it was disgusting and all of those. And yet out here, he's experienced this incredible, unconditional love of people because he is just a beautiful person. And Bruce Hales's lies are falling hollow on our lives and on his life especially.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1752s)

Definitely. And yeah, it's like my, obviously he's now my ex, but when I was with my ex for nine years and his parents, they, because they knew that I hadn't got my parents in my life, they treated me like their own son, unconditionally.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1766s)

Yeah, you find that. Like, I've been single for a long time, and you know, I want to say for the people out there that aren't sure about relationships, I love my single life. I'm very comfortable single. And I mean, it does have a lot to do with the geographical location because I live in the sticks and kind of the only gay in the village, but I'm comfortable with that. But my friends are, a lot of my, most of my friends are straight. And the people in my life that I've, I used to, when I first left for the first 12 months, I remember plucking [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1796s) the courage and taking one of my closest friends, in kind of like my mother figure, out for lunch. And I was just so nervous because, "This is the day I'm going to tell her I'm gay." And she's like, "Ben," or like when I told her, she's like, "Is this what you brought me out for lunch for?" I'm like, "Yeah," and I was about to pee my pants. I think I'd been out for like, just left the community for like two months. And she's like, "I could tell you were gay when you were a Brethren boy walking down the street." So I was like, it was just, it was like nothing. 

And her husband [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1827s) is, you know, the captain of quite a big footy, was the captain of quite a big football, NRL game here in Australia. Like, and for that, like, it, that comes with a whole toxic straight male community. And he was so accepting and kind and cool about it that he was like, "What about it?" And it was just so odd because he was my grandpa's age, to have, you know, three months before, my grandpa trying to work out whether it was the cows that made me gay or, and then just a guy was like, "Okay, let's go to the back and kick a footy. I don't care that [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1857s) gay." It was just, I wanted to lie down. So much information and rewriting the narrative, like it can be quite exhausting because all these lies you've been fed all your life, like, and coming out into reality is, it's the complete opposite.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1873s)

What about you, Stephane? How did you find it when you left?

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1880s)

Well, I found I had loads of friends as well, just the same as you guys. I've met a lot of one, really, really wonderful people, and it's quite the opposite of what they tell you at the beginning. And they say, I have the same story, like, "You'll end up in the gutter and you'll have nothing." And you kind of, you're so fearful when you leave because you're thinking, "Yes, all this will happen," and none of it happens, really. I mean, you get through tough times, but yeah, people were really, really helpful. I went straight [into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1910s) London and met loads and loads of wonderful people. And actually, pretty much immediately as I arrived in London, well, my one of my first steps was like to look for a job. I hadn't even gone on to the gay scene at all because that wasn't my priority. Priority was to get a job. 

And I was like working in a hotel, and then there's suddenly this businessman that gives me his card with a wink, wink. And I'm thinking, "Well, is this what I'm really thinking is happening?" Because I thought, "Surely he [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1940s) be gay," because I've been told gays are weirdos and, you know, they're really sinful people. And that man was quite dashing in a suit. And I was thinking, "Hang on, can he be gay, really?" It was quite the opposite, really. So yeah, it was like, the whole thing collapsed. I was like, "Actually, okay, there might be loads of wonderful gay people around here in London, and I'm here for a good ride now."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1971s)

Literally, would that have been your first work bonus? Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1978s)

Yeah. I just think it's interesting that all of you have experienced that contrast of acceptance, you know, with some trauma alongside it and some obviously some dissonance going on, I imagine.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=1993s)

And I was going to say, it's not unfamiliar to have like this, it's not imposter syndrome, but almost where you are like, "Hang on, I'm just waiting to wake up and everyone's like, 'Jokes on you, it's not real.'" Like, you do have that continually. Like, I recently, my cousin and I just signed up to kickball here in Sydney, and there's like a 240 gay, queer community. It's amazing. And we've never played sports. I've never played sports with gay people. I've always done it with straight communities out, like out where I live, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2023s) back in, back back in school and back in the Brethren community, we weren't good at sports and we didn't have confidence around it. We went to school together, my cousin and I, and we were joking and laughing about it on the way home from the game last Sunday, where we were like, "We're actually fucking good." And, and you know, we didn't, we never thought we were. And all this time we're like, "Everything's so nice and they like us." And I'm like, "I know, Nick, that's what popularity feels like. It's a new feeling. It feels great." And it's just, it's even seven years out, [both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2054s) of us, they came out eight months after I left. It's just, you're constantly getting these beautiful, uplifting experiences that add to the wealth and kaleidoscope that life is. It's just, but it's not unfamiliar to have the moments where you're like, "Hang on, is this really real? All my life I've been taught the opposite."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2071s)

Yeah, yeah. And speaking of that, I'd like to come back to your t-shirt, if I may, Fritz, to the next, no, that's all right, Ben, it's, it's great. The next myth that's on your t-shirt that I think maybe if we can talk around this, it might help anybody inside. And it was, "What you are going on with is sin." Now, that's a phrase that's been said about a lot of people, but what context was that said in? And also, I mean, I'm not [terribly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2101s), the Brethren will quote scripture that, you know, being gay is sin, and as I understand it, it's misquoted, but perhaps people can help with that.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2110s)

Yeah, so one of the main scriptures that they use about homosexuality is Romans 1, which speaks about men shaming their bodies, working lust with each other, or something like that. I can't quote it off the top of my head, but it's quite interesting. My psychiatrist at The Priory was a Christian. He was like the Brethren-approved psychiatrist. And he actually explained that scripture to me, and he said, "Look, they've got it totally wrong. What that actually refers [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2148s) is that at that time in the synagogues, rent boys were being flouted around." So that actually, scripture actually refers to men and rent boys. It doesn't refer to people having a loving relationship or indeed even being homosexual, you know, the home, the, you know, actually being homosexual itself. So, yeah, they do, I don't know what other scriptures they use. Some others might be able to...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2176s)

You know, well, they use one in like the early testament where it's like, but it's in the same context of there's like the next verse is, you know, or two verses down is, "wearing, you know, cloth of, you know, two different fabrics." I mean, like, who doesn't wear polyester and nylon and cotton all at the one time? I mean, picking, you know, picking, what do they call it, or you helicopter what verses you want, you know, that suit your cult.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2206s)

Yeah, I think as someone who's studied the Bible for a very long time, one of the things I've discovered is that the translation, you know, it didn't appear in scripture until quite late in the 20th century, the word "homosexual." And looking at the culture of the Bible in the Bible times and the different Jewish tradition and the early Christian tradition was that they had these feasts. The non-Christians had these feasts. They'd feast and they'd worship [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2236s) these gods. And afterwards, they'd have this room at the back of their houses where they would have these kids, children, girls and boys, that they would then go and chew. Once they were drunk, they would go and have sex with these children, girls and boys alike. And that is what Paul and what the Old Testament was talking about was these shrine prostitutes, these children that were used as a form of celebration of wealth and of being so spiritually adept with the gods. And that's why Jesus said himself, "[If](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2267s) you do this to one of these, you should be thrown into the sea with a millstone around your neck." It wasn't about homosexuality because actually they didn't have a term for that. I'm from a family of Jews and a family of Christians, and their interpretation of scripture is that it didn't appear, it didn't appear in the scripture. The scripture is not clear on gay relationships. In fact, it often refers to people who had same-sex loving relationships without the sex. So I think it's important to understand that modern-day [translations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2297s) that came from America have turned it into homosexuality because that's their fear.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2303s)

Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, were you ever told anything scripturally, Craig, that, or Stephane, that you know, that was about the homosexual side of things?

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2318s)

No, I wasn't, but I remember a brother that was put out of fellowship in Le Chambon, and it was on that basis, on that scripture in Romans. And I remember after the meeting, all the, you know, we were all going into our Bible to figure out what it was really saying when it was quite clear that he'd been put out of fellowship for being gay. But on that subject, I just want to say, well, that's my personal view, but I think being gay is not a sin, period. It is just not a sin. And I think they need to [hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2348s) that in there. We are, I am not a sick person. I do not need to be cured. And I don't feel it's a sin at all. And when I first had those inklings that I was being gay, it happened quite late to me because I was quite candid when I was young. It came from a pure place. It didn't come from a dark, sinful place. So, you know, this is who we are, and it's like, well, it is not a sin because the sin is not to be accepting who I am. That would be [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2378s) sin. But otherwise, being gay is not a sin. So I'd quite like to bang on that, really.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2384s)

And from a total non-Christian perspective, it's in their head, not yours. You know, like, it's whatever. Okay, I'm a sinner.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2394s)

Cool. Yeah. Yeah, I get what you're saying, Ben. Yeah, it's in their head that it's a sin, and if we are a sinner, so what sort of thing. 

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2408s)

Yeah, also that, that point, it's consensual sinning\!

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2412s)

I was just gonna say the points you were just making, it's for those that are inside that may be struggling with their sexuality, it's one of the, what Fritz spoke about, fear. It's a fear that they're choosing to be gay. There is no choice in it. Yeah, you're not, you cannot choose it. Therefore, there's nothing to fear about making that choice. You, the only choice you're making is being true to yourself and being true to the person you really are.

That's the important thing to point out to people inside, isn't it? Your fear of making a choice is not choosing your sexuality. There's no choice there. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2462s)

Totally agree. And I just felt that's quite important because they do labour the point, from what I understand, that it's a sin, but it isn't a sin. Pedophilia is a sin, but this isn't a sin.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2474s)

An important thing to also understand and remember is that sin of Sodom. The sin of Sodom allegedly is homosexuality. When you look at that story again, all the men of Sodom came to the house where the angels were and said, "Bring these strangers out so that we can have sex with them." So the entire community, heterosexual community of men, wanted to have sex. And the sin of Sodom, according to what the [scripture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2505s) teaches, is inhospitality. Is not giving the stranger, the different one, a welcome, not making them feel part of our community. So yeah, it's not about being gay. It's about this. And the Brethren highlight this entirely and perfectly with their complete exclusion rule, that they can't mix with people outside. You know, these people outside, we're better than them, we're more superior. That's the sin of Sodom, is seeing yourself as above and beyond the [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2535s) in the world in which we live, rather than being like Jesus and welcoming them in, the sinner, the stranger, the least, the lost, and lonely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2542s)

Just the way they are. That's beautifully said, that really is, I think.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2547s)

Too, like, it's a very different generation thing as well. Like, in terms of, you were saying what scriptures did they use. I didn't know that there were scriptures on homosexuality because it never said the word, and gay, until after I left, until I really studied theology or and scripture, Christianity. It wasn't until after, like, in my time in the Brethren, and I think it is the case today, you're not quoted scripture. You're just quoted what these men have said. Like, it's not based on scripture because they [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2577s) to say to you, you know, "Well, whereabouts in scripture?" "No, no, it's our brother has said this, and it's, you know, it's synonymous with scripture."

 So I think, I think it's really important to get back to, if you're into your religion and wanting to understand, you're in there, you've got a Bible, you want to get back to the basics and where we're all, you know, your faith has come from, look, look into it. It's not, take away the man that's teaching you or telling you and look into actually what it is. And also, that is [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2607s) Bible or a script that was written, you know, 3,500 years ago, whatever, plus, we're talking, you don't, we don't use medicine books from that era to heal us today. So it's, yes, it's a book of morals and a guide, and you can derive faith from that, but it should be taken from all parts of the world. All parts of your experience should build up your faith, your spirituality, because it's a whole holistic thing, not just, "Well, it says it here, I'm going to do it." You know, I think it's really important to note that it was written [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2637s) then for that time. And yes, we can draw from it today, but we don't use medicine books from that time to heal ourselves today. You evolve. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2647s)

I totally agree. And it's interesting you say that about the understanding. Paul, you've given us some good understanding of what the scriptures mean. And I would encourage anybody inside to do that rather than listen to the rhetoric they're given, because even in my day, and Ben, I left the Brethren way before you were even born or thought of, it was the same. It was still, "the man of God's," he said. And I don't remember much teaching about scripture and what they meant and the context with which they were [written](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2677s). And I think that's very important when you get it quoted at you as a, as a sound bite that's been used as a weapon against you. I think it's important to do that, particularly if it's in relation to your sexuality.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2690s)

I don't think I ever had a single Bible verse quoted at me. It was all about what Bruce Hales said. Yeah, which is so strange looking back.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2698s)

Yeah, yeah. You're absolutely right, Craig. It is strange looking back, but at the time, that's where the fear is, isn't it? You know, it's, "Oh gosh, Bruce Hales said," and, yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2709s)

But I think the other thing that's really strange is that like, despite how homophobic the Brethren are, they go through these backflips trying to deny it, like they went to lengths to try and deny that they had kicked me out for being gay. And when they eventually took issue with it, that was when I told my brothers and sisters that I was gay, and they said I was going to be shut up for "defilement of young people." And I said, "You can't say that at an assembly meeting, because if you shut me up for defilement of young people, it goes back to the point about assuming that gay people are pedophiles. If that's what they say, that's what everyone's going to assume." And I said, "[Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2751s) can't you just tell the truth and say that I've come out as gay and that you don't accept that, and that's why I'm being shut up?" And they wouldn't. They just went through loop after loop to avoid actually saying that I was gay in any Brethren meetings. So the only reason anyone in there knew that I was gay was because I came out and said it publicly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2771s)

That's a really interesting point, because all of you are no longer in the Brethren. Was there another reason given, or was it because, I think you're right, Craig, they don't admit, they would never admit publicly that, "We're no longer going to be with this person because they're gay," would they?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2792s)

No. So for me, the two reasons that were given for me was that I was on Facebook, and also that I was in contact with people who were out. They were the two reasons that were given for me being withdrawn from, but it was basically because I was gay and they didn't know what to do with me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2812s)

Anyone else? I don't even know why, you don't even know why you're not... No, Stephane, do you know why you were withdrawn from?

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2822s)

On the basis of separation. But on that subject, I must admit that one of my fears, because I was so like ingrained, I was so, I thought it would be extremely shameful to be put out of fellowship under the circumstances that I was gay, because I didn't want to be out at that stage, not within the PBCC. I'm quite proud now, and I, you know, I regret in a way not to have accepted it then, but I was put out under this, the fact that I [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2853s) follow separation. I've met some people that were out of fellowship, my brothers and some more, some of the people that were out of fellowship.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2861s)

Yeah, I had my grandpa turn up to work and say, but I had before, like, I withdrew from them, kind of thing. So I don't know why they, why I was like withdrawn from. I am obviously withdrawn from for being a fully-fledged homo. But they, my dad, my grandpa did turn up to work, but I couldn't understand what he was saying because it's just a lot of blabbering and crying. But he was saying something's happening tomorrow and you've got a chance to come back. And I just said, "Whatever you do in your church is going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2891s) happen tomorrow, but see that shop? I'm going to come and open up tomorrow morning and live my life because none of that's in my head." But I think the thing was that he "left his father's house" or something, that was what was used. Okay.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2904s)

I ain't coming back. What about you, Fritz?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2909s)

Yeah, I think for me it was like, to leave, and then the whole 2 Timothy thing. I definitely, being gay wasn't mentioned in there. But then I remember my cousin, when he was withdrawn from, I remember the meeting, they said he had "chosen a different lifestyle." At that, I don't have a clue what they're talking about. But that made it pretty clear what, to probably to everyone else. But yeah, they definitely didn't mention, not in the letter I got, I know.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2939s)

I think when I did get shut up, the scripture that they quoted was "evil communications."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2948s)

what you're speaking Arabic or something.

Well, not saying that, I don't mean that racist comment either. I don't mean that racist. See, I'm just the Brethren, obviously Muslims are evil, so yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2961s)

Yeah, along with their homophobia, there's that as well, isn't there? Yeah, it's just interesting because it's almost as if, as a group, they know that to say they would not accept a gay person in their church is not acceptable, so they'll do anything but say that. And whilst I would, I do not agree with it, you'd almost have more respect for them if they said, "We are a church that won't accept gay people," because although you [may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=2991s) not agree with it, you just say, "Well, I won't go to that church then." But to be hypocritical about it is something I find difficult, very difficult.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3000s)

I think, too, if you look at the bigger picture, they've got too much to lose, right? If they were to come on and say, "We don't accept gay people," well, cancel culture is big enough for them to lose their charitable status, right? Absolutely. And in turn, you know, every charity would pull out working with them. I mean, we've seen that in the UK, right, with the ambulance or the fire service?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3020s)

Yeah, the fire service. So the fire service had a meeting in which the LGBT contingent of the annual general meeting specified they didn't want to be supported by the Rapid Relief Team because, were the fire brigade aware of their homophobia? And I think the motion was carried. I think they did sever ties with the RRT, with that one particular fire brigade, for that reason. 

So you're right, Ben, they would have a lot to lose if they came out and were actually [honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3050s) and said, I mean, we live in a world where you can believe what you like. Not everybody has to agree with what you believe, but you don't abuse other people because of your beliefs. That's where I have an issue. And as I say, if they said, quite frankly, "We don't agree with homosexuality or gay women, we don't allow them in our church," they wouldn't survive, but at least they've been true. But they don't say that, and that's what's wrong, you know, that's what's, the hypocrisy is what makes it wrong, apart from everything else.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3079s)

And it does really affect them. Like, recently I've heard from a teacher that was found out gay in Sydney, OneSchool Global, and the lifestyle that isn't Brethren. And so this teacher was disappeared, and he took them to court for unfair dismissal and won. 

Yeah. So they can't win. They won't win against. And I think it's that, you know, a little trump card for anybody speaking up out here is that, you know, getting the gay community on board and their injustice towards them really speaks volumes because generally the whole world doesn't care. They're on board with the gay community. It's part of the community. And I think as time progresses, we'll see more and more of it fall apart because of that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3122s)

I agree. I mean, if you go back 50 years in the UK, sort of in the 1950s, homosexuality was still illegal. And we've come an awful long way since then. It's almost as if the Brethren haven't, but society doesn't care. Society accepts people just the way they are now. And that's where they will fall down, I'm sure. We've still got four points left on your t-shirt, Fritz. Can I read the next one out? The next one's a good one. Yeah, the next one's a good [one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3153s) So it was, "You'll be dissolute, corrupt morally, leading a life of dissipation, perversion and lacking in moral restraint." So that was another quote told to you. Totally, totally.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3171s)

Do we all get an invite to this party? Like let's just unpack that word for a moment. Exactly, like...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3187s)

Should I read it again?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3191s)

 We've never seen anything more, exemplified of the word “dissipation” than the squandering of the Brethren's wealth. 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3204s)

So again, Fritz, this was a quote to you or written? 

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3210s)

Yeah, right."Dissolute," and I had to look it up because I didn't have a clue what they meant. This was from the parents. I don't remember the email that they were describing. Again, it's probably another one of what I'm going on with and, you know, "you need to repent" and the rest of it. But yeah, so this wasn't the whole quote, they used just the word "dissolute" and I just didn't have a clue what it meant. So I'd look it up and I was just quite taken aback by how strong a word it was, coming from [parents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3240s) as well.

Yeah, I thought it was quite a disgusting way to talk about a family member.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3249s)

Yeah. So this was a word that was used by family members towards what they perceived to be the way you were.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3256s)

Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's one of the emails that they used to send about repenting and where I was living. And obviously they knew at this point I was living with Paul, and that was obviously another problem for them. And that's ultimately why they eventually shut me up, because they couldn't deal with the fact that I was living with someone else.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3279s)

It's, they're like not unfamiliar terms. I'm the opposite side of the globe and I'm hearing, you know, I heard the words "debauchery," "dissolute," "living in sin" or "dissipation," all these, all these words where it's like constantly, like, the overindulgence of sex and drugs. You don't, obviously never understood the gay community at all. And I do think this is a general society, it was a general society thing. Obviously the Brethren are still in the 50s, 40s, whereas like [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3309s) you, all you've ever, and I think the AIDS crisis really brought about a new look on on homosexuality because, and that was probably a trigger for it, where people did just think being gay was about sex.

 I remember having this conversation with my mum where it's like, "So if I don't partake in the sexual act and I still want the company of a man, am I still gay?" And she had a real conflict in her head because, and I could see that she was convicted by it because you are automatically [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3339s) in the box of debauchery, of overindulgence in sex when it comes to coming out as gay. And when I first confessed I was gay, I hadn't even had sex. I barely knew what masturbation was. You know, it's such a big, such an incorrect narrative that they have in their minds of the gay community.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3358s)

And I think that, yeah, of the gay community, and I don't think that also stems from their lack of sex education as well.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3365s)

Yeah, definitely. Interestingly, when I came out, they were more threatened by someone being openly gay than they were about the sex. Because as a teenager, I confessed to having sex multiple times, and the priests always swept it under the rug. And for so long as I was prepared to not talk about it, not admit it, they could cover it without bringing it to the assembly. And as soon as I stepped back and was like, "You know what, no, actually, I'm going to be openly gay and this is who I'm going to be," like that to them was way worse than the sex.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3395s)

That's interesting, isn't it?...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3399s)

Yes, when I first had sex, I had to write it all out and they shared a bit of paper and like, I'm talking, they wanted, Lester’s demand was like, "Want every detail." And so I wrote it all out in very graphic, detailed form. And you know, it was obviously passed around, but I wonder where it is today because I'd like to publish it as a really raunchy novel.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3420s)

Maybe you should ask him, Ben.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3422s)

Now that he's out. It's probably why he's out. He got caught reading my novel.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlbjx3tSbRRQ%26t%3D3431s)

Well, you can also, you can put in a request, and a few former Brisbane have done this, you can put in a request to the Brethren under the Privacy Act for whichever country you're in, requesting all records that they hold on you. Like, as an organization, you're entitled to know what documents they have in their files. So put in a Privacy Act request then, see if they've still got it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3456s)

Yeah, that, for that, that bit of information. But my, my grandpa never had a, we're digressing here, but he never had a computer. So he had an email address, I think on my dad's laptop or computer, and they used to print out emails to him. And they always used to leave them in the printer at work. So I'd be like, "Oh, another one about me. This is interesting." And I'd be like, I have this compilation of these emails about me between priests and other elders, and I'm just like, "Here I am working nine to five, [working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3487s) my ass off, and you guys are just talking about me in the kitchen."

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlbjx3tSbRRQ%26t%3D3492s)

You know, one of the, one the funniest things I ever got sent was printouts from someone's Brethren computer where they had printed out like screenshots of like mine and someone else's Facebook pages, and they were going through circling people in the pictures trying to work out who they were.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3509s)

Wow. Yeah, wow. Yeah, yeah. The next point on your t-shirt is actually a really interesting one, Fritz. You're wanting to know what's coming up now, don't you? But the next one, I think it's a whole can of worms. And this quote is, "Legalizing your sinful course will not make things any better for you." Now, this was obviously a few years back because you've been out a few years now, and we know, don't we, that [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3539s) been, I mean, you probably know the details more than me, but when legalizing gay marriage was a political debate, the Brethren were very concerned about that, weren't they? I mean, let's talk about that for a little bit.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3553s)

Yeah, I, it's weird because I think about this the other day. I think someone mentioned a different podcast about there being, it being such an issue, and I, I'm sure I remember having one of their sort of very early morning prayer meetings about like on the day that the vote came in. But I don't remember understanding what was the equal marriage, but that wouldn't have meant really anything to me because I didn't understand what being gay was. So equal marriage could have meant anything. So yeah, I remember it being about, I don't remember the whys and wherefores. I remember the sort of, you know, letters being read out as well. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3592s) yeah, I just was at an age where I just didn't really understand what they're talking about. So others might have remembered more about it than I do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3599s)

Yeah, I mean, I, wasn't there a huge campaign in Canada? Obviously, our Canadian podcast friends would know more about this than us, but a huge campaign in Canada where they wrote letters to try and prevent the legalization of gay marriage and so on, wasn't there? And it's also interesting because we were, we were leaked a memo recently that was sent to all parents of Brethren schools. [Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3629s), I can take a minute just to read it out and perhaps we can pick this apart. The memo says,

 "Dear parents, we'd like to remind you of the importance of remaining vigilant in an area of immoral curriculum and teaching in the public schooling system. There is increasing normalization of same-sex relationships and gender diversity that has been taught within the educational program. We need to protect our children from these alternative lifestyles that are contrary to our beliefs and our way of life. [Could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3660s) we all be encouraged to stay close to the programs and the curriculum your child has been taught and take a stand where necessary? If you are unsure of what to do if a situation has arisen, then help is available through and provide support. See below."

 So that memo would seem to suggest to us that the schools are maybe trying to teach something that the Brethren are kicking back against. What do we put, I mean, this is speculative, I would stress now, because we don't know why that [memo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3690s) is set, but what do people make of that?

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3693s)

I think, I'm not surprising. Like, the Brethren are very attuned for what the rest of society is doing and thinking, even if they don't agree with it. And I think like relationships that are not the standard heterosexual relationship or, you know, gender diverse, all of these things are becoming quite normal and spoken about in regular society. And it wouldn't surprise me if sort of those conversations and that normalization is spilling over into the Brethren schools, whether that's through the teachers or whether it's through kids that are watching movies. And you have a lot of kids in there that are engaging with popular culture even when they're not supposed to be. And so, like, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3735s) think that normalization is happening a lot more than it used to. And I certainly see, like, the younger people that are coming out of the Brethren now are a lot less homophobic than some of the older ones who came out.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlbjx3tSbRRQ%26t%3D3750s)

Definitely. I've noticed that too with helping younger kids that came out. And one in particular who, you know, is a close friend, and she, she left straight from high school and won a scholarship, like, and disappeared from the Brethren. But I'm still in touch with her. She was like, she said when they brought it up, I was like, she's very intelligent, and she was like, "And who cares?" And she was bullied at school for having that opinion, but she wasn't the only one that thought that, you know. And then speaking to teachers now [today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3780s) that are still in there from all over the globe that have reached out through TikTok, they're like, "There's, there's a slight, like a change because of the, the like." And you'll notice the Brethren react accordingly, like this letter, or like moving them from WhatsApp to Signal, or getting rid of, when they got rid of BlackBerry Messenger. 

Every time there was any sort of progress that allowed social media or allowed access to normal life, to normal reality, they immediately react [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3810s) it. And because you notice that the kids are changing. And in particular, this teacher spoke about children's relationship with just animals, for example, because in my era, there was obviously a generation of deeply emotionally disturbed children who show signs of that by either starting fires or hurting animals. And she said, "There's a change. There's like kids that are showing love to animals." And she said, "There's just a, you can tell that they're having a different exposure to what [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3840s) had." So definitely, I think it's, yeah, changing a little bit.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlbjx3tSbRRQ%26t%3D3844s)

Yeah, and like, short of living in their own gated community, they do still exist in regular society. And so regular society is influencing them whether they like it or not. And that's, that's the biggest fear, isn't it, from Bruce Hales and the rest of the leadership, is that the people on the inside are seeing what's going on on the outside.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3864s)

And I think that's a good point to make, is that society has changed phenomenally in the last 50 years anyway. And as society's attitudes, and you know, we, I mean, I work in an institution where we regularly have to do courses on diversity and inclusion and everything else, but it's stressed in a lot of workplaces now, isn't it, whereas it wasn't 50 years ago. And if the Brethren don't move along with those times, they are going to get found out, aren't they, one way or another, either in the schools or...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3900s)

They still, they still forbid interracial marriage. Like, how long is it going to take them to catch up?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3906s)

Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, they're going to be 100 years behind society, but you know, maybe not in our lifetime, but maybe, yeah.

### [**Paul Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3913s)

Yeah, I think we've seen that recently here in the UK with questions about the schools, the OneSchool Global, and teachers who are not, obviously not Brethren, were in there, who've had young people come to them and identify themselves as possibly being LGBTQ. And then the teachers have suddenly disappeared from the schools, or the young people have disappeared as well. And also, we've had in the UK, we've had this amazing thing, Carol Vorderman, who's very, very important in this country, has just [done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3944s) this big exposé on the COVID contracts, which the Conservative Party awarded so many to Brethren companies. Everything they provided was faulty. And now the UK, even my friends, colleagues of mine at work are like, "Is that the same group that Fritz was in?" I'm like, "Yes." They're like, "Oh my goodness." 

So they're ripping us off and they're abusing people in their community. And [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=3974s) it's gonna, same with the LGBTQ, they're like, "So they rejected Fritz because he is gay." But most of my colleagues, I'm a teacher and I've got a lot of female colleagues, they're like, "So they projected your lovely husband and his mum isn't able to see him just because he's gay." And they're like, as mothers, they're like, "Outrageous." You know, and I think it's becoming increasingly, as you said, Jacky, people are waking up and going, "They've been so secretive and so under the radar, are now suddenly they're being lifted above the [radar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4004s), people are like, these people shouldn't be here. They shouldn't be in our society."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4008s)

I even had a teacher recently say to me that a mother came to her distraught. She's like, "I know my husband's gay. I realize now, and I understand now why we were put together and why there's no love." And I'm just like, these people are becoming more aware. And I don't know if it's like, she did say a lot of people listening to podcasts in there, but you don't realize. And I just think this is what I mean by knowledge is power. Like, you know, you, the more you are exposed to it, to the real world, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4038s) understand and then hear other people's experiences like ours, that we've been through something very similar, you become more aware of what you're a part of.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4045s)

Can I talk about Section 28, which came out in the 1980s? So Section 28 was an act that went through Parliament in the UK in Margaret Thatcher's era, and that was, it was a whole bill, but the Act, the Section 28, was to ban the teaching of homosexuality in schools. And at the time, the Brethren lobbied [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4075s) heavily. They lobbied Parliament heavily and did actually pass, and it came into law. It was finally, it was finally repealed in 2003, so it took a long time for it to actually be repealed. But you know, and now they're sort of like, they're still going down the same sort of rabbit holes, really, albeit not in a political, legal sense.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4103s)

Which was the same here in Australia. You know, John Hales, and I don't know if it's John Hales directly, but I know, well, I was told that, you know, John Hales and in the time of John Howard, our Prime Minister at the time, his, the leadership at that time in the Brethren were heavily involved in helping write the Marriage Act. You know, that obviously has changed now, but you know, the Brethren won't vote because "our kingdom is not of this world," but will happily throw money and weight and legislation around [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4134s) all of a sudden our kingdom is of this world. So again, hypocrisy.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dlbjx3tSbRRQ%26t%3D4138s)

The Brethren got super involved in fighting against civil union bills in New Zealand around 2003, 2004\. They weren't the only religious groups doing that in New Zealand, but it caused such a backlash. And I've had a number of conversations about this with with members of parliament since and what it was like having the Brethren getting involved. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4164s) we had the civil union debate in New Zealand and then the marriage equality debate about 10 years later. And even the conservative MPs, when marriage equality came through, were telling the religious groups, "The way you carried on during the civil union debate was so off-putting to public opinion that you're actually having the opposite effect of what you're intending." So basically, the louder you shout against gay people, the more likely it is that the public is going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4194s) support marriage equality because you're being so repulsive.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4198s)

Yeah, interesting.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4199s)

And I think that's a big thing for the Brethren, I think, is that they are homophobic, but they don't want to be publicly seen to be homophobic. And a lot of their lobbying and sort of pushing is happening very quietly behind closed doors now because they know what a bad look it is for the group if they're saying these things publicly.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4220s)

Yeah, I mean the PR has come a long way because I think in the 1980s, they were literally open, openly lobbying any shame at all.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4229s)

And I think like that had a big impact on me when I was in the Brethren and we saw what they were saying to journalists and it's like, "Well, we know what we believe behind closed doors. Why do we need to bullshit about it to journalists?" And if what you believe and what you're presenting are two different things, then that raises all sorts of questions about your belief structure. That had a big impact on me as a teenager, realizing that we didn't publicly admit what we thought.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4256s)

Yeah, and I think that's a good point to make to anyone that's inside that's listening. There's a couple of points left on your t-shirt, Fritz, but before we do that, I wanted to touch on something. You know, we talk about the Brethren being homophobic, but what I wanted to ask is, when any of you were actually in the Brethren, did you experience direct verbal, physical persecution because you were gay? Stephane, perhaps we'll start with you, that you can remember.

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4286s)

It was a long time ago, and I had a lucky escape because I left at 17\. I was shut up at 17\. So yeah, only, only very little, I have to say, but it happened nonetheless, but not to the extent that I've been hearing on some of the podcasts of other people. So I think, yeah, it's best moving on to other people. But it did, it did happen. And one of the person that did it to me actually turns out that suspicion is gay because I've had some some [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4317s) that came out later on and they say, "Oh, I think he's, he's gay." And I'm like, "Oh, maybe that's why there was a bit of bullying from his end. He was trying to hide something." Yeah, projecting.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4328s)

Yeah, as we said earlier, didn't we, Ben? Yeah, projecting. Yeah. What about the rest of you? I mean, or you know, did you have overt persecution or...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4337s)

I was bullied as a child continually. I had boys sit, lie on top of me and try and break my neck and all sorts. Yeah. But it was all came down to that I was girly or gay, or as I like to say now, in touch with my feminine side. So yeah, but definitely, on a more serious note, definitely. And it's traumatizing. You do, you know, I was put, put in a bin and pushed down a hill and like, things like that. You're already struggling with trying to work out your sexuality, and you wonder why so many Brethren boys that have helped leave had severe anxiety, which obviously leads to depression and then substance abuse, which is alcohol in there. And it's all around, you know, the toxic culture and the lack of a safe landing pad for somebody to come out in.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4383s)

Yeah, yeah. So to me, my, my bullying happened behind closed doors, right? Actually, my brother, I was bullied by him for probably three or four years because he suspected I was gay. And the abuse he gave me, it was just non-stop for three or four years, with me having a nervous breakdown. So, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4406s)

Yeah, and I think it's particularly hard, Ross, when it's your family, right? Like, I remember I was so close with my mum, but the, not the insults, but her constant like, when she was told, "Should you wear that shirt? You know, it might look..." And I'm like, "Look what?" You know, it's very, it hurts. It hurts the most when it's from your family.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4430s)

What about you, Fritz?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4431s)

Yeah, mine was just, was verbal, from, you know, accusing of looking or being or acting gay and the rest of it. And although it sounds, doesn't sound like very much, when you're in that sort of, that sort of environment, being accused of that sort of thing is, it can put a real fear in you, doesn't it? And it's just the whispering behind your back and that kind of thing.

Never got physical, thankfully. It was just all verbal slurs and that kind of thing, mostly from family members, to be fair. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4466s)

It's interesting that it fits though, because even though you say they're little comments, well, I mean, Ben, I understand you were subject to some quite overt comments online once you left, weren't you? So that's very, and it's...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4478s)

Interesting that the places that most of the bullying came from was, was orchestrated from. So the boy in my class, but you know, he'd walk around like this and everybody knew. He told me from the local, local here with, you know, that a group of cousins, and he was overtly gay. And he was the one that orchestrated, you know, being bashed and bullied every night at church. So, and then since then, leaving, it hasn't stopped in terms of, I had a death threat last year from someone within, and that's been [followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4508s) through the court system now, so I can't speak much on it, but I will in time. But again, like, in knowing who it was and speaking out to other people, there is a certain pattern here with each of these people. The one that we can share is or talk about is, you know, when I first left on, came onto my Instagram and literally left, trolled who I'd left at the time, which I didn't send a screenshot of just because it was kind of vulgar, but I'll say it. You know, talking to him, saying that because we're both gay, why don't we, you know, why doesn't he go [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4538s) do horrendous things to me. And interestingly enough, we found out who this was, and he is Bruce Hales's brother's grandson, so Steve Hales's grandson.

 And I contacted his mom because I had done interior work for these girls, and I had nothing against them at that point, you know, I was like, "Whatever." And I do feel sorry for them because they are, you know, caught up within that echelon of, you know, the royal family, and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4569s) wouldn't be in there. They would be, you know, having great times out here. I just feel sorry for them being so trapped. But yeah, he came onto my Instagram and I screenshotted all this and sent it to his mom after finding out who it was, because we'll always find out who you are. And she, she and her husband sent me an apology. 

But I was like, the interesting thing is, I think there's another one that said, "I'd love to let a bull run through this shop for poofs," or something like that. I was like, "Well, your [mum's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4599s) been here, boy. And, you know, furnished her house with my staff. So why don't you just run around your lounge room with a bull?" So it's, and it can be quite, like I'm, you would think, you know, I'm very resilient and I'm, you know, I can put up with this, but it's quite, you think you've left a toxic environment and to have somebody come on like this and and leave comments like this and troll you, knowing it's from within the Brethren, is very triggering and can put you back into the place you were at 15, 16, where you were being bullied and [abused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4629s), struggling with your homosexuality. So it can be very unsettling. And for anyone inside, you know, you do come across people like this, but the difference is out here, you can take control of this. You can get the right authorities involved. You can expose it how you like, like I'm doing here on a podcast. It's not just, "Well, the Lord has forgiven him, let's sweep it under a rug." No, you little, I'm going to say your name publicly. Don't mess with me.

Yeah, you have the opportunity to create a boundary. You know, you have the opportunity to put yourself in a safe place and and make sure it stays like that because, no, here, that's what happens in the real world. You're not controlled by anybody.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4667s)

And that's one of the reasons I asked that question about, sort of, either very, very, you know, hurtful homophobic comments like you had, Ben, or even like you had, Fritz, the little subtle niggles. They eat away at you, right? And I think that's what can actually cause the mental health issues, the anxiety and the depression. And it's wrong because it's like you are actually having a go at somebody because of the way they are. And it's just wrong on every level, [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4697s) a human level, on a, you know, if you want to say a religious level, on a religious level, it's just wrong. And I think that's the message to get across to anybody inside who is being subject to this kind of behavior. You don't have to put up with it, do you?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4710s)

No, no, never. You don't have to. No. Yeah, when I first left, somebody told me this, and I think it's so important to remember on leaving, is nobody looks after you as well as you do. So if you can get out here and create a safe, find a safe landing pad, there are all of us out here that would happily help anybody leave. I speak for myself in that case. And you can create a safe place, put up boundaries, put up walls. You don't have to have to do with your family if they were toxic. [Chances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4740s) are you probably won't be allowed to, but you can build a new one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4743s)

Yeah, yeah, so true, so true. So, Fritz, the penultimate comment, we've touched on this one on your t-shirt, the penultimate comment was, "The Devil has got a grip on you, making you think this way."

Where did that one come from?

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4761s)

Yeah, so I think this is probably tied into the first quote about the Devil tricking you're gay. It's a weird thought, isn't it? Because obviously you're brought up in an environment where gay isn't even mentioned. It's very much, obviously not in schools, as we've touched on. It's, you know, even if we saw someone, two guys holding hands down the street, it's very much, you know, "Look at that." You know, we would say horrible things about them, that kind of thing. So then to say that, you know, I've been made to think this way, the only environment I've been in is in the Brethren. So there's nowhere else I get my information from. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4797s) yeah, it's just, there's no way of it being a choice or being tricked or anything when you've been brought up in an environment where you're so protected in, in a, you know, and in there's all protection.

Yeah, it's again, it was, yeah, it's tied on into that first...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4816s)

It is the first one, "The Devil tricked you into thinking you are gay." The two are very, very similar. What about the rest of you? Did you ever have comments about, you know, "The Devil's got hold of you?" I mean, it's quite an interesting comment, isn't it? I'm not quite sure how the Devil does get hold of us, but there you go. So if you have any comments along those lines...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4834s)

Yeah, when I finally came out, came out to the priest and said I was going to live my life as an openly gay man, and they told me that I was mentally unwell and that I was unstable and all of these things because, like, to them, if you were not going to be a good Brethren, then clearly you were messed up in the head. And one of the first things I did, and I'm so glad I did it, was I went to my local GP for a second opinion on whether I was crazy.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4863s)

And he said...

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4865s)

And he said that I was good, and the thing is, when you're leaving, you're going through these like extreme emotions, and so you wonder, like, "Am I mentally unstable?" And my doctor just brushed it off completely and he said, "There's absolutely nothing wrong with you, and these emotions you're experiencing are a normal response to an extreme situation. And I'd be more worried if you weren't experiencing them." And that was so reassuring because they really get in your head [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4895s) you're leaving and when you try and stand up for yourself. And for the doctor to just tell it straight and be like, "No, it's actually normal that you feel really conflicted about all this." And so, you know, "Go, come and be you." And he, he said, I can't remember the exact words, but he's like, "I just want you to know," and because I had a cold, and he's like, he said, "I just want you to know that what you're experiencing is a normal viral infection. It's not the wrath of God being brought down on you, no matter what this church might tell you."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4922s)

Yeah, that's lovely. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4926s)

They, and they always seem to use that, the illness thing. And then, and this I think is such a huge fear in obviously anybody that leaving, not just solely gay people. Like, I've helped, you know, straight people leave too, and it's their biggest fear is like, "I know it's not real. I know it's not God doing this, but help me. Like, how do I cope with the fact that I keep thinking that I'm sick or I'm in hospital because of this?" I'm like, "Listen, it's just natural life. We are human. We're not perfect bodies that are, you know, we [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4956s) from genetics of, of flawed genetics." You know, we aren't perfect. So we do get things that go wrong with this, and that's life. We can't just put everything down to, you know, some supernatural being. And I think, yeah, it's really important to remember that that things happen.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=4974s)

It does, totally. And I think it's also interesting because it's about counting the hits and the misses, isn't it? Because you have this fear when you leave, "Golly, if I get ill, I might be in a car accident." I think I remember Gilli saying in his personal podcast, the first time he went on holiday, he was convinced the plane was going to crash because, you know, that's what God was going to do to him. But the interesting thing is, when somebody gets ill in the Brethren, what do they say about that? That's not God judging them, that's, you know...

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5003s)

It depends what age the person is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5005s)

Well, that's what I mean, if they get, yes.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5007s)

And their family name, right? Like, they will use it to be like, "Oh, it's everybody else that needs this." Yeah.

Or if they, if the guy's a bit dodgy, they'll use it against him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5017s)

They'll use it against him. But it's, as you say, it happens, and that's the unpredictability of life, isn't it? You know, it's, it's not judgment on you or anything like that at all....

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5031s)

So it's not God's discipline. There's not sitting up there with a button that says "smite," waiting for you to walk under a bridge. You know, "You're too gay today." "Bing, we're gonna give you a cold." "Yeah, I told you not to wear that feather boa."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5046s)

That's caused your virus, Craig. What about the rest of you? Was the Devil ever brought into your, you know, gayness, if you like, from the Brethren perspective? Or was it never said as obviously as that?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5060s)

Yeah, it was said to me by my brother.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5063s)

Was it?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5063s)

Yeah, I was in The Priory at the time, and that was the first time I'd come out as gay to anybody. In fact, he was the first person in the Brethren that knew. He was the first person I came out to, and he gave me a whole five to ten-minute diatribe on how wrong it was and it was sinful and, you know, it was evil and I'd be going to hell and all the rest of it. And I actually, it's quite funny really because I spoke about it with my psychiatrist the next day, what happened, and he said, "Well, karma will actually come back and get him. [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5100s) will be something in his life that will happen because he's been so vile to you. God will see to it that, you know, something will happen in his life that's nasty, basically." Which I found quite interesting.

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5116s)

Yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5117s)

But I mean, we out here, we call it karma, but yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5123s)

And it's just, it speaks for itself, right? You can only say things like that when you're utterly miserable with your own life. And that, whilst I never admit it, it's inadvertently obvious, right?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5133s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5136s)

Yeah, it was slightly, kind of borderline on this subject, but for years I was like in fear of of AIDS because, yeah, I was in those years that AIDS, in the eyes of the Brethren, gay equals AIDS or HIV. And that trauma kind of followed me for quite a while because I was thinking, "Oh my God, like I will, you know, I'm out now and I'm bound to be HIV positive anytime soon." And that kind of [followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5166s) me for a long, long time before I could get rid of that fear. That fear was so instilled at the time. And then these are during the the AIDS year was all just passed because it was '93, so it's like still in the kind of pandemic of the AIDS, you know, crisis. And yeah, that was a really terrible fear I had to deal with all the time. Like, and thinking, "Oh, you know, if I get caught and I get HIV, then it'll [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5196s) God's wrath upon me," because that's how they saw it, you see. Yeah, that's quite, quite a difficult thing to deal with, I think.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5203s)

I can imagine.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5204s)

I don't think it's changed at all, Stephane. Like, I relate to that. I came out at what, 2016, '17 when I left, and I carry that fear. And it wasn't because, okay, and again, like sex education is non-existent. So yeah, and I remember a gay friend pulling me aside and going, "Hey, there's an experiment they're doing at the moment. It's worked in Canada where you can go on PrEP, where it's basically, if you do have sex with somebody that has HIV, it's not contractible." And so I went up just for my [own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5234s) interest, I joined up to the New South Wales experiment that they had, and you got free medication and you were able to try it. And so I became a part of that. And in doing that, you also got the results of like the experiment. And from the end of the experiment, over three years, I think it was, you were told the conclusion was that the biggest transmitters of that year, I can't remember whether it was 2017 or 2018, the biggest transmitters of [HIV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5264s) were straight people. And it was just really interesting. And I used to say to my girlfriends at the time, like they were single and, you know, just experiencing life and sleeping around and doing what you do when you're single. And we're like, "How come we don't have this medicine? Why it's always the gay people that get the priority?" I'm like...

Hang on, back it up. But I was, yeah, I said, "You know, it's, it's the awareness, like that you would go and sleep with somebody with no protection." It's, there's this here as well. So it's, it's really interesting to rewrite that narrative because for me, I was the same. I was terrified of sex because I was like, I thought you could catch AIDS just by looking at a gay man. You know, I know, really. Just going to the club. Yeah, yeah. So it's, it's really interesting to rewrite a narrative, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5311s) for anyone in there that's fearing that, it's not, it's non-existent today. There's so much more acceptance and and awareness about it. HIV is literally, if you, if you're on medication for it, it's, and it's not, you still have it, but it's not transmissible, it's not contractible. So it's, it's...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5330s)

It doesn't develop, it doesn't develop into AIDS anymore like it did in the 80s. I mean, I worked in the medical field when they first found the virus in dentistry, and of course the whole profession went AWOL and gloves came on and masks came on. And it was because there was a huge fear in the world generally. So I can imagine, Stephane, at the time, you know, early 90s, society was more frightened of that anyway. Yeah. And then you coming out thought, "Well, that's going to be God's wrath on me, isn't it? You know, that's, this is what's going to [happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5360s)." Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5361s)

In the Brethren, my earliest memory of AIDS was the time when Diana took off her glove and shook a guy with AIDS' hand. I was like, it was incredible.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5372s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5373s)

So I'm going to come on to the last point on your t-shirt. Let me just share my screen. Fritz, the last point on your t-shirt is a lovely one that we can talk through. And it says, "We really, really," if you can see it there, "we really, really want to help you out in your plight."

Unpick that one. Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5397s)

They, they, well, obviously they're very genuine. They're, what they thought was the best thing to do is, you know, save me from hell and the rest of it. The interesting thing was, they never could say the word "gay." It was always "plight" or the other word they used was "my situation."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5418s)

I can never actually, I was literally about to say that. I was about to say, but in doing that, they're kind of admitting, like, "plight" is, you know, an unfortunate situation. And they used to always use that word. In doing that, you're admitting it's a situation, which usually means it's not something that you can help, like you found yourself...

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5431s)

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And it was one of the interesting things, going back to the other one, probably about the Devil to think you can't be cured. On the first meeting when I met back with Dad, Mum, about a week after I left, I remember Dad saying that he didn't realize that you could actually cure it. And it was only when someone mentioned to him, one of the priests said, "Oh, actually, there's help out there," that he then went on their bandwagon of trying to get me cured. So it's interesting that [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5461s) dad even thought that it wasn't even a, even a thing. Yeah. And also that obviously makes it, you would think that makes them realize it's not a choice as well.

Yeah. And also they, they never told me what the help would be. I did ask the priest that turned up at my door once, and he said, "Well, start off with spiritual help." And then it would go from there. He never elaborated what it would be, but I guess that's because they're being careful. Well, it came out.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5494s)

If they told you what they were going to do, you probably wouldn't consent to it, I imagine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. What about the rest of them? I'm picking this, "We really, really want to help you with your plight." I mean, I...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5506s)

What does "plight" mean? What does it mean? Unfortunate situation that you find yourself in, like dire straits. I mean, it's not a plight to me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5518s)

No.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5519s)

No, absolutely not. It's...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5521s)

In their heads, isn't it?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5522s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5522s)

Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And then the last thing I wanted to touch on was, one of the main motivations for doing this podcast for all of you, I imagine, is to try and help anybody inside who is struggling at the moment. Not just struggling wanting to leave, but struggling because of their sexuality and having this culture that, in this culture that's just saying, "That's not the way you should be." What message would each of you want to give to anybody in that situation inside [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5552s) the moment?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5553s)

Suicide might be a thought, because it was for me. But if only I could go back to that 16, 17, 18-year-old boy, and then even younger as a child, I would love to say, "You could have the complete opposite life. You could be free, you could be safe, you could be financially secure, you could have loving friends of any denomination or [background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5583s), and not have this fear and guilt in your head all the time. You'll be able to put it aside and compartmentalize it and feel free from your thought." Because the biggest thing that all us leavers, straight, gay, whatever, struggle with is the guilt and the shame. You can have all of that and work through all of that and put it aside and live a completely peaceful life. And that's what I would say. So you know, at times where it does seem like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, suicide is an [option](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5613s), there is just one more option, and you should give it a go.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5618s)

Yeah, yeah. Like Ben has said, you know, so you might think suicide is an option. I did. But if you can only just realize that there is so much help out here. There's those of us that have left. You're part of the LGBTQ+ community, and there's more and more of us leaving all the time. So there's more and more people to reach out to. There are, there are helplines [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5648s), if you can get a non-UBT phone, you can phone. There's the Gay and Lesbian Switchboard in the UK. I don't know what there is around the rest of the world. I think Cheryl usually posts a list of help lines that are available at the end of every podcast. And also there are support groups out here as well. Like I mentioned earlier, I'm part of a meetup group locally, and there are 800 members of [us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5678s). We meet up every week for some activity or another, be it coffee, be it cinema night, be a quiz night, be it games night. There's all sorts of, and there's groups all over the world for LGBTQ+ people. And also, you know, it's Pride season in the summer. If you can get away from parents for the day, go to a Pride and you'll find out there's thousands of people just like yourself.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5707s)

And just on that note, because I know for me, I was terrified. Like, I was surprisingly quite a shy gay when I first came out. Those events even were terrifying, even though I was out. So what you could say is, and it's closer to home, is if you're in the workforce and you've got a work colleague around you that's non-Brethren that you really trust, confide in them. Because I have two close friends to me now that I worked with [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5738s) in there. And they're like, "We knew you were gay. We were waiting for you to tell us and we could help you." So if everything else seems intimidating and too, too scary to approach, somebody you've got a connection with probably already knows because most people do. Have a chat with them. And if you feel safe enough, baby steps.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5759s)

Little steps. Fritz, I think you wore this t-shirt to a Pride march, didn't you? So that's the idea, is the first one you went to. So what would you say to anyone inside? Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5768s)

So this is our first Pride we went to in our, where we live now in Southampton, my hometown. Yeah, really, it's a similar vein, really. Just the fact that you're not, you're not alone. You really aren't. You can, I know how lonely it feels in there, not only wanting to get out, but also being gay as well. There's just a double, there's two levels there. And yeah, you can't, yeah, I can't express to you how free you feel when you leave because you've not [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5798s) shaken off the rules and the fear and the control, you also can be your true, authentic self. And it's, it's like another level of freedom. It's incredible. I didn't think I'd survive two years out here because I was such a good Brethren boy. So, but it's, it's, yeah, you can almost hardly explain it because it's so, so freeing, being just being you, be able to be you, and for people to accept you for being you as well.

### [**Stephane Vergnon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5827s)

Again, I'd like to say to them, listen, it is not a sin to be gay. We've said that before, but I think they need to hear it again. In terms of places, we've listed all the places, but there's also like when you're around in town and if you see the freedom flag, which is the rainbow flag that's just behind Ben and Ross and, and it's also, oh, I'll do a little product placement here, it's also on the on the top, on the Get-A-Life t-shirt [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5857s) going here too.

When you see that flag in front of a, you know, bakeries or bars or or any shops, that you can step in and and you'll be like meeting non-judgmental people at all who will be really ready to help if you, if you're in a, you know, in a difficult situation. And they can, they can point you maybe to the next associations or wherever you can get help if you need some.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5882s)

That's such a good idea. I never thought of that. And I often see them in shop windows. We have a little thing here, it says, "Say yeah," or "safe zone" or something with the trifle or the whole flag. Yeah, they're everywhere. What a brilliant idea. Yeah, because some, some communities in the Brethren are quite isolated, like where I am. Yeah, I mean, I'm only an hour from the city, but I don't have time to duck to the city, find a gay community, come back without my dad going, "Where have you been?" every 15 minutes. So I think, I think that's a great idea.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5911s)

It's, it's, before we come on to you, Craig, it's, it's in the, I mean, this is part of the reason why in our workplace we get given rainbow badges with our work logo on. And it's, it's one of the reasons they say wear them, and I wear mine with pride, is because it says to anybody who's there, "There's no judgment here." It's just that an unspoken message, isn't it, that rainbow flag, those rainbow colors. There's an unspoken message that hopefully makes people feel at home or [accepted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5941s).

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5941s)

And it's for anybody too. Like, I know when I go to the gym and wear this shirt, I don't get any work done because I'm chatting to everybody. Everybody wants to have a chat. Whereas I wear just normal gym clothes, people, like, I don't know, something about it says, "Hey, you can say whatever you want to me. There's no judgment." Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5959s)

Yeah. Craig, did you have a final message for anyone inside that may be struggling and listening to this podcast? You've been thinking about it.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5967s)

Yeah, time to reflect. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5971s)

Yeah.

### [**Craig Hoyle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=5971s)

Yeah, I think for anyone who's still on the inside, what the Brethren are telling you, what Bruce Hales is saying about gay people isn't true. You don't have to hate yourself. And there's a whole community of people out here who will love and welcome and accept you as you are. And you can be true to yourself, you can be authentic. And what they say about your life being a failure and ending up in the gutter, that's absolutely not true. You can have a good life and be true to yourself.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6002s)

Yeah, I agree totally. And Gilli, I'm going to ask you the same question from the perspective of somebody who isn't gay, but perhaps had a different perspective. Because I mean, as we said, even leaving and being gay as well, it must feel like two things to overcome. So from the perspective of somebody who isn't gay, what would you say to anyone who's in and is struggling?

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6023s)

I think the main point I would want to make to anyone is that because within the people, you'll be made to feel this way. You're not weird for being gay. It's okay. It's normal. It's part of our society today. You're not a weirdo. There's nothing wrong with coming out, being gay, being proud about it. Yes, the people make you feel that it's all sorts of wrong on all sorts of levels.

But if you can, if you, like the others have said, if you can just find someone to reach out to, just to have that contact and like Ross has said about the, like the non-judgmental side of things, there's so much, yes, society's got a long way to go, but there's so much more acceptance in, you know, in the wider society that will accept you for who you are. People have said it already in this podcast, they don't care. It doesn't make any difference. No, no, no.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6090s)

And you're a human. Yeah. And the strange thing is, Gilli, the only experience I've ever had in terms of homophobia has come from Brethren that have rung me or have trolled my accounts or have left notes. Other than that, I don't have any homophobia. And I should, because I live Western Sydney, like where it should be prevalent, but it's not. It's so not. It's, it's the opposite.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6113s)

Yeah, yeah. And and the other thing, the other point I just want to make is that because often, often like when, this doesn't just apply to, you know, the LGBT community, but people who often leave in the PBCC will reach out to could be other ex-members or anything. But if there are, if you do come across someone that you feel isn't, isn't accepting, then just cut that person off. You don't have to talk to someone. Find someone else, yeah, because there is, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6143s) is, there is, unfortunately, there is still a lot of people who, probably more, it probably happens when more when people have left recently, they're still carrying that PBCC mentality of, you know, or even...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6156s)

Older school Brethren that have left, they still have that homophobic stance.

### [**John (Gilli) Gilliland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6159s)

Judgmental, judgment, of things. If you come across someone like that, just, just stop talking to them because you don't, just because they are an ex-PBCC doesn't make their opinion right or any more valid. Just cut them out to find someone else to talk to that will accept that, you will accept you for who you are because hopefully they're in the minority, the people who don't accept you. But you don't, just because, just [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6190s) they are an ex-PBCC doesn't mean you have to have a connection with them.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6192s)

Oh, and like in the PBCC, you have to get on with everybody because you're close and thrown together. Out here, you can either like or not like somebody, and it doesn't matter.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6202s)

Yeah, yeah. Like the whole "no preference and prejudice." Oh, gosh.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6207s)

My preference and prejudice, everybody. No, you're always going to get on with some people more than others, aren't you?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6213s)

100%. You don't have to have them to your house because you've got a break list on Friday night saying, "This is who you're gonna have." No thanks, I don't want anybody in my house. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6222s)

Abby wants to say something. I was gonna say, Abi's joined us a bit late. Thanks, Abby, for joining. Oh, hey Abby.

### [**Ab**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6230s)**i**

Sorry to be late, and I look like, so I'm just gonna keep my camera off.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6235s)

Hey, you're on a gay panel. You can look like...

### [**Ab**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6238s)**i**

Yeah, but there's a...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6239s)

Lot, we'll still judge you. She's still keeping her camera off, Ben. ..

### [**Abby**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6244s)

It's not going on. We've had a day. Anyhow, I just wanted to say that I was very much an anti-gay person in the PBCC. I used homophobic slurs, and I admit to that. And you know, I was definitely in the wrong, I'll be honest. But since coming out, it's strange how my friendships have formed, and my best friends are [lesbians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6278s). And of course, the inquisitive, outspoken Abi asked them about how they, how it came to be that they were lesbians and like, what was the process and did you try the other first, etc. And they explained it that they were literally born like it. And that was a real new concept to me because I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6309s) taught in the Brethren that it was a result of unbridled lust, is how Bruce Hales put it. And I thought that it was just men and women that couldn't control themselves, basically. But no, my friends explained.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6327s)

It’s not that horny. I don't understand this. Speaking for myself, I might have lower libido or something, but I'm just not that horny. Like, what, what does it mean, "unbridled lust"?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6338s)

Yeah, right.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6341s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6342s)

I think, I mean, I think I just want to say thank you so much to all of you for coming on and talking, because I really hope it will help anybody inside that is struggling and they'll feel they can reach out just for that help. The other thing I would want to say to anyone inside that's struggling mentally, not only because they may want to leave, but because of their sexuality, look at these guys here. They look happy. They look free. Yeah, all of them. And yeah, they've had their [struggles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6372s) and they've had a lot of demons to fight, but they are happy and free. And I think it goes back to saying the biggest gift you can give somebody is to allow them to truly be themselves. And I hope you've all experienced that since leaving. So thank you so much, everybody, for joining us on Get-A-Life podcast. Until next time, much love to all of you.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbjx3tSbRRQ&t=6397s)

Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
