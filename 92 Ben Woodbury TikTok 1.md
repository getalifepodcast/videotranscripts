## Summary

Ben Woodbury is known as Excultboy on TikTok and has helped inform thousands of people about the Exclusive Brethren/PBCC. Ben's vulnerable conversations bring truth to the surface time and time again, which allow for many people to shed what they've experienced in his safe space. Not only does he dive into all the questions he gets from around the world, Ben converses with many survivors of the PBCC (not all of them are ex-members)! Ben sheds light on why he does what he does and what drives his passion to keep on exposing the corruption and abuse behind their closed doors. We have compiled a ton of Ben's TikTok's here and will continue adding more for those who can't or don't access TikTok.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith, and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression, and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=55s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Most of you know Ben Woodbury. For those of you that don't, Ben is an ex-PBCC member from Windsor, Australia. Welcome, Ben.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=71s)

Hi, how are you?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=73s)

Doing good. How are you doing?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=75s)

Yeah, great. Really good. It's hot as hell in Australia, so we're just finally getting a bit of that summer heat. Not that I enjoy that. I would be very happy with the idea of a Dan Murphy's cool room sort of temperature all year round.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=90s)

We can trade spots.

One of the things that we are doing today is Ben has a TikTok account where he is an avid, avid advocate for what goes on beyond the PBCC closed doors and brings it forward. We wanted to compile a lot of his videos into one place for those that don't have access to TikTok or have access to how to watch all of Ben's TikToks. So that's what we're going to do today.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=124s) I just want to say from all of us ex-members, Ben, we are so grateful for the articulation that you have when it comes to managing the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of questions that you get. So I am so grateful for it. One of my biggest questions that I think a lot of people want to know is why do you do what you do? Like what provoked you to get on TikTok and do what you're doing?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=154s)

Well, good question, because I guess in terms of being on the other side, being in the Brethren, I know a lot would have a lot to say about that in terms of, okay, you know, why haven't you moved on? Like, what, you know, it's one thing to leave the Brethren but it's another thing to make it your life and tell, you know, constantly attack us and be an opposer.

Look, I want to just say from the get-go, it's not my life. It doesn't control me. It's taken me seven years to be in a position where I can comfortably talk about my experiences [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=191s) the experiences of others. Now, I had the opportunity to have a platform, you know, as we do with social media, whereby I can tell my story. And the reason I did that is because obviously, since leaving in the seven years, I've helped a numerous amount of people from girls, boys, straight, gay, couples, leave the cult.

And in doing so, I felt like there were so many similarities and I felt a lot of repetition in terms of saying, hey, this is a really easy way to eliminate the stress of leaving and create a safe landing pad. So I felt like it needed to be public. And it's not really something, it's one thing to read how to leave. It's one thing to have a newspaper article on how to leave, but I feel like it's a whole different thing.

In my own case, I relate better to people. We learn a lot from people, and I've experienced it and I've seen it over and over and over [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=252s) the last seven years with the 15-plus people I've helped leave. So why not share that? And it is in no way a way of attacking them. It is about awareness, it's about knowledge, it's about exposing what is, in my belief, injustices. And I think it's really been great. It's taken a journey, you know, that I didn't expect to happen, from interviews to newspaper articles about my experiences, which I'm very [open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=282s) in sharing.

I'm very in touch with all parts of me, be that the vulnerable side, my emotions, my spirituality, my religious beliefs now, and I'm okay with that. And more importantly, I'm speaking in terms of my community, and that is the LGBTQ+ community. Because I don't feel like it's one thing to leave the Brethren, but it's another thing to stand up and speak from a minority within a minority. So being a closeted gay man in the Brethren, I do know how hard it is [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=313s) get up and speak about your experiences when you're already dealing with the fact that you've left a very toxic cult.

So I think that really sums up why I do it. I'm passionate about it because it has helped people, so why wouldn't I continue to do it? Being paid for it? Well, I have heard a couple of rumors. Apparently, I get paid every time somebody leaves. Well, you know what? I've got my bank details ready. I'm waiting for the money. I have a full-time business. I have, you know, I work for what I have and I work very [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=343s) for that.

And I like to share that with people in terms of like, you can come out here and be what the Brethren call monetarily successful, because obviously that's their metric or their measure of success, is their wealth. Well, for me, that's like peace and happiness and a good circle of friends. Right. But out here, if you want to look at it, like my dad used to always say to me, you'll end up in the gutter, you'll end up with nothing, you'll end up in a caravan. And I was like, well, Dad, I can make a caravan look pretty nice. So at [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=373s) end of the day, it's about the community you have around you, the fact that you're actually safe and you have an opportunity to earn money if that is what you want to base your success on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=384s)

Yeah, that's great. And you know, you answered a question that I had. I wanted to ask you, was, I mean so many of them in there have labeled us as, you know, we can't get on with our life. We're not moving on. We're obsessed with them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And there's such a difference between raising awareness and us trying to get our family out of there versus not being able to get over.

The point is that we do what we do in order to raise this awareness. And I think [specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=414s) on your TikTok account, that's what's happened, is so many people who have never heard of the PBCC, Exclusive Brethren, ever before. I mean, you are informing thousands and thousands and thousands of people who these people are, living in their backyard. Or in this case, I guess a lot of comments come forward of people who have had experiences with them and they weren't very good.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=438s)

Yeah. And I do think that, you know, just to back it up a bit about, you know, you haven't gotten over it. To say that from an inside perspective is a very unfair statement to make because you've never left. So you don't know what it takes to get over it. And that can be any of our journeys. It doesn't matter. There's no time limit on getting over it.

I'm not over it. I'll never probably be over it because it was 24 years of my life that was [wholly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=468s) traumatic. And it still is because your life isn't the same and never will be again. You don't have all that community, be it negative or positive. Your experience is there, you don't have that whole community around you. So of course, you're adjusting, you're constantly changing, you're constantly growing, you're constantly learning as to, oh, that was a trigger, that was a trauma response. You know, you're constantly aware and it's always in your mind that this is because you have grown up in a toxic cult. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=498s) no, you don't get over it. You never do.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=501s)

And you don't get over leaving your family behind in there. Like that is one thing every ex-member can say, that we grieve the living dead, right? Like we are always grieving our family. It's a lot.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=516s)

harder to grieve because it's not a tangible closure. You can't go to a gravesite and put flowers down and go, okay, that's where it ended. I can grieve and get closure. No, you carry it with you whilst you might bump into them at the shops or someone else that reminds you of them. It's a constant, you're constantly there. So you have to be extremely resilient and extremely versatile in terms of your life going forward. And I think, you know, hats off to people that can do that. It's not for everybody.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=547s)

No. What would you say are some of the main themes that keep coming up for you in all of the TikToks that you have done?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=556s)

The first thing that stands out the most is people relating, like people's experiences, non-community members, 'worldlies', non-Brethren, going, hey, I've seen that. I didn't know what the behind-the-door story was. Or my dad worked there, or my mom was a teacher there and was kicked out because she explained, I just had recently and just done a TikTok on, because she explained a girl thought she was dying because she was having her period.

And, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=586s) know, the teacher explained to her what that was. And she lost her job over it. And I related to that because I said, well, sex ed isn't a thing in there. And me growing up, developing as a young man, I didn't know what pubic hair was. And I had a similar conversation with my brother and then my mom. And she had such a horrific reaction to my questions about my changing body that she was like, oh, I should [ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=617s) dad, look, and I thought, well, your reaction was so severe, why would I ask my dad who is a hundred times more religiously severe than you are? 

So you know, you turn to, and you've probably heard my other podcasts if you've heard this before, other stories of how, you know, I used to speak to a sex worker growing up because that was the only source of information I could get about my identity growing up as a gay man, you know, what was it. And because sex is such a taboo, sex education is such a taboo. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=647s) that's where I was relating to the other side of that. I'm like, I understand why these girls thought they were dying when they had their period. And unfortunately, the teacher was the one that bore the consequences of that, losing her job over doing what any normal human would do, explain what's happening.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=662s)

It sometimes is just so surreal though, to sit back after you've put out a TikTok and you go through all of the messages, right? Like you can sit back and you're just like, wow, to be able to give that kind of knowledge and information to the public, to be able to have those tools and be aware of the PBCC when they come into contact with them. Like what was it like for you when you first went viral? Like when you just, [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=692s) it just took off?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=694s)

It was a few videos in and I was just like, you know, I'll keep answering people's questions. And then I think there was one I shared of, I obviously, since I left the Brethren, I've always been a kid that had a diary. So when it came to having a mobile phone, they became visual diaries. So I've always had videos of just myself, of my life, not in any way to share. I never thought I would. I often did it just for my own personal growth.

I'd look back this time last year and I look at [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=724s) video, a visual diary I've done of myself in my life and how I feel about leaving the Brethren. And because it's really important, even just in business to do that. And I'm like, oh, hell, for my case, I'm like, okay, no, I was so much fitter back then. Let me just, you know, a year ago, let me tweak back to what I was, you know, look up what I was eating. I'll look at what I was doing in terms of exercise. So I had these visual diaries.

And so I thought I'd share one after my last experience seeing my mother. And obviously, I was upset and emotional and crying and [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=754s) went viral. I think it's got like 2.4 million views on TikTok and thousands and thousands of comments. And I hadn't, I woke up one morning, I was just like, oh my God, it's kind of a bit nerve-wracking because you're letting people access you. But then this is where boundaries are important, right? You set up parameters around how much access they have.

And from there, it was kind of validating, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=785s) makes your experiences feel that much more real, that it's not just something that happened. Because often you find, well, I do, because I live in the same town, I often find I look back and go, hang on, did that actually happen to me? Like, was I ever in that cult? Because you have such a different life, it's such a juxtaposition of the life now. It's like black and white, like it's so different.

And so I think the biggest thing that's come from it is validation of my story and [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=815s) others, because there have been teachers that have come forward about their experiences, other victims, yet they don't want to go public or they've just DM'd me privately. And it's validating for them. They're like, thank you. I now feel that my experience is then that I couldn't put a lid on, I've got closure over. So it's kind of fulfilling.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=834s)

And I would have to say, like going through the comments, your two biggest people that come on and comment that affect what we do is the OneSchool Global teachers that come forward and people who have worked for them. Those tend to be the two biggest people who come forward, isn't it?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=855s)

Yeah, and people that have worked for Brethren that, you know, have either faced racial discrimination, sexual discrimination, ageist discrimination. And then I always get, you know, the occasional comments about them, they find out that they've got a partner at home of same sex. So then you've got the homophobia as well. So it's quite, I wouldn't say there was more than one, like it's very rounded. They're all [there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=885s) There's all like, you know, evidence that it's happening.

And that's why I think it sort of, you know, with yourself, Cheryl, it kind of ignites your fire to keep speaking about it. And people like, oh, when will you stop? I'm like, well, when there's no abusers left in the Brethren community. And I know, and you know I know, that there is because of who I've helped leave and because of who has still contacted me from within the Brethren. Look, and you're like, well, why aren't you doing anything about it? Why aren't you going to the police? Because it's not my journey. I'm [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=915s) here as a platform for people to speak out if they need it or a safe landing pad.

It's not my position to go and drag a victim to a police office because you'd know how traumatic that would be and go, hey, they're being abused. Obviously, if the person is underage, and look, I'm not getting that at the moment. I haven't had that experience. Obviously, I'd report it. But if these people are old enough to do it themselves, I'm there for them until they can. You just can't, it's their journey. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=945s) cannot get involved in that. You've just got to be there. And that's what I get a lot of people ask too. What can I do? You know, I know she's being abused and she's like, you know, in a marriage, it's a neighbor someone has reached out about. I'm like, well, you just got to be there, create that safe space. So when they do tell you, you can advise them, okay, I think you should go to the police. That's all you can do.

Obviously, if somebody's in danger, then you go to the police. Like there's no, like use your brain.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=976s)

Yeah. You have such a way to articulate the traumas. You have such a way to articulate what people are asking. And it's just, I think that's what we all get drawn into, is it's such a raw, vulnerable authenticity that comes out of you. You're so authentic, right? And that's what draws people in, is because there's no, there's no walls that you have to go through. It's just Ben has been...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1003s)

No, and look, I attribute that to, I'm grateful that I was born gay. And it has taken me seven years to be able to say that because I was and had internalized homophobia. I hated gay people, and I hated that I was gay. And that's why I hated gay people. I love that part of me now. I wouldn't change it for anything. And I'm okay with that part.

Whilst we all have parts of us that we are insecure about, and I still have those because I am [human,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1034s) it's a part of me that I've really worked on to be comfortable with because it was the most ickiest part of me that I couldn't sit with. And I think if you can get over that part, and this is specifically to the gay community, the closeted gay community within the Brethren, I know how hard it is, but there are so many people out here now that have overcome this.

And also, I remember, like, my first experience telling a straight person that I was gay and they were like, I already knew. Like, what's this [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1065s) about? I didn't care. I never brought it up with you because it was such a deep secret within me. I was terrified. And I used to be terrified of straight men because of that. Now, they're like, my closest mates are all straight. You know, it's really interesting once you get outside of that compound. And I know I often refer to it, but yes, whilst the Brethren aren't in a compound in a forest, it is a compound, a psychological compound in your mind.

And once you get out of [that,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1095s) life is so different. Life is so full of choice that you can find a group of people that are so accepting. I was just having this conversation the other day with my cousin because we've just signed up to kickball in the city. Now, kickball is an American sport. It's basically like baseball with a very squishy big soccer ball, and it's a great community of like 240 of the gay community. But it also has, you know, non-binary, trans, [lesbian,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1127s) and then there's straight. So there's bisexual, there's a whole community.

They have 240 people and playing these games in this sport with these people, whilst it is competitive, we were just amongst ourselves saying how different this is to what we experienced as growing up in sport. Like you mess up in sport, as you do, and everybody is like, oh, that's fine, don't worry, don't worry about it. Like, whereas in the Brethren, you wanted to die, basically. [Like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1158s) the bullying was so bad.

And it's interesting because I wasn't good at sport at school, but now that has changed. And it's interesting when you surround yourself with positive, uplifting people, your own self-esteem grows, your own confidence grows, and then all of a sudden you're surprising yourself by being, hey, I'm actually not bad at all. You know, it's an interesting perspective change. And I think it's really important for the people in there hearing this that it can change and it will change as soon as you change the people [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1188s) you, as soon as you get out of that toxic environment. Because I'm living proof of it, there are many others that are living proof of it. And share who you are too.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1195s)

And I think I had this conversation with someone this morning and we were talking about when you're born and raised inside that psychological compound and then you leave it, and then you have interaction with people who are still in there, you forget some of the restrictions. You're so tied down in there. They really, truly believe that they're so right. Right?

This is what I was talking with this girl [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1225s) morning, is that they just, because they're so isolated from the real world, they truly, truly believe that everything they say, do, process, everything that goes on in their little world, they believe it is the right way. That there's no room or movement for any kind of alternate belief. Right? They're just so stuck in it. And I think that's one of the most beautiful things that we gain when we leave, is that you have this freedom of allowing beliefs to change, allowing things to change. It's [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1255s) of the most, I think, beautiful gifts that anybody can gift themselves with from leaving a cult like that. It's just to have that freedom of choice, freedom to believe whatever you want, freedom to find those people that lift you up. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1270s)

Definitely. And I think too, it's beautiful that we have the freedom to show that to people still in. Like today, particularly in this era, we have things like social media where we can, you know, whilst social media, I will make a statement, isn't all roses. Like, isn't an accurate representation of life, right? Because you're not going to post yourself having a bad day on social media or feeling a few kilos heavier, right? Because that's not what we do, right? We want to look perfect as humans.

[So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1300s) it's a great way to show that, hey, I'm experiencing life. I'm traveling. I've got my own group of friends. I've got a family, I've got a partner, I've got children, I've got an animal, I've got a pet. You know, it's, I'm studying all these things that people inside, and I've had this feedback myself from a guy I helped leave who was gay. He came out to me and he said, you're the first person I told. And I'm like, hey mate, I already knew you were. Like, it's okay.

And that wasn't, that's not the conversation I want to have going [forward.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1331s) It's like setting you up, helping you out, let's get your life sorted. And he was like, it was from watching your Instagram, it was from watching your life on social media that made me go, hey, this person looks like they're living a peaceful, safe life, not depressed. And I'm like, yeah, because it's not. And leaving that, his whole life has changed from, you know, being heavily dependent on medication for depression and anxiety to now being [able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1361s) to create his own safe space, have his own friendship group who love and support him like we do.

It's just beautiful to see. Like it's like, oh, another one is free. And you know what, I won't stop until, because I remember Bruce Hales said to me in his little list of things was that there are more people in here that have overcome your flesh, as in being gay, than that have left. Well, I've set it out to make my business to make sure there are more people that have overcome the [toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1392s) straight community that it is and actually leave and live authentic lives. Because you only have one opportunity at this.

And what you said before really struck home with me about, you know, you have choice of freedom, like how right you think you are in there. And it is because that's all you know. And it's terrifying, I know from my own experience, it's terrifying to think that there are other options, other alternatives out here, because with that comes all of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1422s) guilt tripping that has been ingrained into you for all your life, that you will not succeed. God will punish you. God's waiting to smite you.

You know, it's not that at all. You don't have, like, whether you believe in Christianity or not, it's not that at all. Life throws lemons at you. You do have curveballs. I got hit up the back of my car yesterday. I wasn't like, it's God speaking to me. It's pure science. There was an idiot behind me that didn't stop in time. Like if you break it down like that, you can really then put things into [perspective,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1452s) compartmentalize it and actually move forward and you're not surrounded, you're not in that compound in your mind.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1459s)

Yeah, and I think another thing that all your TikToks are doing is it's breaking the narrative in there, right? Because when something doesn't fit the structure of what they've been told to believe, they create a narrative, right? All these narratives are constantly coming out to fit them and to allow them to stay prisoners to those beliefs that they have.

And so I think one of the biggest things that I love about everything that's coming out of the discussion of your TikToks [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1489s) the way that you respond to their questions is it allows those inside who are watching to start maybe opening up and realizing that maybe the narratives that they are telling themselves are not the truth. And to me personally, that is why I do what I do. Like that is what I do. I want my family, I want my nieces and nephews to know that the narrative that they're being told about every ex-member isn't true.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1520s)

I think this is such an important point you raise, Cheryl, and I'm so glad you did because the breaking of the narrative, that is part of breaking a cycle, is part of breaking that generational curse, as we sometimes call it. And I think it's so important that your narrative is changed because, you know, all my life growing up, my mum had two brothers that were out, and we were taught, you know, as to why they were out.

And what, it's interesting when you actually meet the person [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1550s) then have the conversation with them and they tell their version of events, you realize how much of a narrative you've actually been spun. And this happens so much. I hear this a lot from, you know, a husband will leave a wife in there or a wife will leave her kids. And obviously, the Brethren will take the side of whoever stays within the church because they are right. Doesn't matter if he's a rapist, doesn't matter if he's an abuser, we will cover his tracks because he's following the light.

And it's interesting, so if [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1580s) have been told a narrative about a relative that has left, maybe just give them a little bit of leniency, give them a little bit of patience and actually contact them and hear, if they're open to it, some aren't, and hear their version of events. And they could be the person that helps you leave. They can be the person that's there for you because most likely, most humans out here will help you leave because they understand in particular what it's like to grow up in that community.

I just think it's really important when you're hearing a narrative, you haven't heard the whole side of it. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1610s) haven't heard the other side. You know, in my own case, a lot of people are like, oh, he left because he's gay. That was one reason. I knew I was gay when I was nine years old. I had a lot of time to leave, you know, growing up. I left when I heard about a relative that was raped. I left when I heard about other abuses. I left when I heard that there were predators walking around freely who, you know, who people knew about, who these priests and elders and Bruce Hales knew about, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1640s) were walking around freely.

Yet I hadn't even had sex yet at the point when I had confessed that I was gay, yet I was deemed the irredeemable one. I was deemed the sinner. And you're not, you know, I had this conversation with my mom, are you gay on the thought of being gay or are you gay on the action? Because then, you know, bring it back to the Bible, we're judged by our actions, not by our thoughts. So it was just, it's really important, I think, to hear both sides of the narrative if you're going to, you know, listen to a story, especially [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1671s) you're in the Brethren.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1671s)

Yeah, and I think they build those narratives though, on the family that is left, so that those walls are built that you're afraid to reach out. I mean, when I left, I was so scared of my uncle, that was my uncle Dennis that passed away this summer. And what, he came and found me, the biggest heart. He was nothing like I had been, that they had painted him inside there. This man would give you the shirt off his back. He searched and searched [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1701s) searched for me until he found me.

And I think that just remember that those narratives are built in there to help keep you from reaching out to those that have left. So that's their number one thing. We are going to end this podcast with a bunch of Ben's TikToks and we are going to come up with more of them compiled together for everyone to watch. And Ben will join us again and we're going to go through some of the comments that everybody has gone through [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1731s) just go through some of the pretty horrific ones that land underneath his TikToks.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1737s)

Good luck, guys. Yeah, thank you. And put on your helmet.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1740s)

Yes. Thanks so much, Ben. And here's the first episode of his TikTok compilation.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1747s)

Hi, if you're new here, my name is Ben Woodbury and seven years ago I escaped the Exclusive Brethren, or as they've recently rebranded, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, a cult. Well, in my opinion, it's a cult, and I grew up here in this cult in Australia. It's worldwide, it's global, about 60,000 members worldwide, and I'm answering all your questions. So if you've got any questions about it, hit me up.

Not many people speak out about this religion or cult because they're terrified of the [consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1778s) or the fear of the discipline of God and all these other awful indoctrinated teachings that you grow up with. So, lucky for me, I'm not afraid of it. So, I will happily answer any questions and speak up about this. This question here, I've answered sort of other ways, but I'm just going to cut to the chase. Somebody's asked here why they drink so heavily on Sundays. And why it's not just [Sundays,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1808s) might I add.

Yes, that's when it mainly happens, but it's pretty much every night of the week. Not all of them, majority of them. We're talking about 99.9% of them have a drinking problem. And how do they explain away this practice? Great question.

Well, I think I've said this before in another video, but I'll say it again and again and again, because it needs to be shared. One of the previous leaders was a renowned alcoholic and he said this, and I quote, "Drink makes a strong man stronger and a weak man weaker." So I don't even need to unpack that.

Its toxic, misogynistic tone says it all. So, well, obviously you don't want to be a weak man, so I'll drink as much as I can to prove that I'm a strong man. Yeah, it's very almost childlike, teenage, you know, school, tough boy crowd shit. Yeah, so that's why they drink. And also it's a crutch, it's a vice, it's their, [it's,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1885s) it's the substance they abuse to get, you know, get by on this highly pressured society they live in. You need a crutch to survive.

I remember one of the leader's family saying to me, you'd be surprised if you knew how many people on the front row in the church or how many prominent brothers were on tablets, were on pills, were on, you know, to cope. [Like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1916s) well, if you left it, you wouldn't need it because you can live a happy, healthy life. Thanks for your questions, guys. Keep them coming.

Anyway, back to the question. So because I had my business when I left, this question, great question. Thank you. Did it affect, did leaving affect my business at all?

No, actually. And no, nothing's too personal. Guys, ask me whatever you like. I literally have explained to you just a few videos ago that I got my sex education off an escort. So, which is a story for another day, well I can answer it soon, but so I had my own business. Like I'd set it up six months prior to leaving. I worked for the leader's son-in-law, which was, [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1964s) a whole another level of wow for five years, I think.

So I worked for me and my dad for a year, which was awful. I couldn't even live with him, let alone work with him. And then I threatened to run away and then sort of came out, converted basically, or tried to, you know, and then worked for another business for five years. And then I was like, I need to get out of here. It's just too, my life was too toxic. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=1995s) know, I was really battling with the will to live, literally.

So I set up my own interior design slash furniture design business, and I kind of designed two furniture pieces and some friends I've made through work connections were like, you have to enter them into AC Design Awards. And I did, and I was a finalist. I'll share those images with you. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2026s) yeah, so it was kind of really, it gave me courage or confidence to keep going.

And yeah, sort of one thing led to another and here I am today. I, you know, seven years later, I'm still in business and, you know, being a creative and just sort of now plucked up the courage to voice my story in my life and put it out there. And there's so many incredible things that have happened that I can't wait to share with you all. And I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Thanks for your kindness.

Now, I've had a few questions about this, like, do people go, you know, and break the rules secretly, have internet access, you know, get social media, all in secret, of course, things that weren't allowed? Yes, they do. But the rules are so strict, you'd keep it very secret. I know I have a lot that follow me on my Instagram because I've kept my Instagram very open and public to show them, the ones that follow me, that you can live a normal, happy, healthy, safe lifestyle out here. And you can make friends and have people that love you unconditionally.

So yes. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2099s) witnessed this a lot, right? So I was very sheltered growing up and followed the rule by the book and I was very, you know, I wanted to be a good, I was a good kid, to a point, you know, because I wanted the gay to go away in me and I didn't know how to do it. So I tried to be really, you know, a really astute Christian, so to speak, a perfect Brethren boy.

So there were moments where I was exposed to other people's [lives,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2129s) like I remember, so I started out doing interior design and I came across other, like working in other Brethren homes. Then like I'd see them on their computers or whatever in the house, which we were allowed to have, but they had to be through a certain Brethren company, same with your phones. So it was all filtered and monitored and controlled access to anything because it was all through a Brethren company.

But I remember seeing like someone on YouTube or, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2159s) know, I remember one of the leader's relatives saying to me, oh yeah, like we just bought mom an iPhone. Why would you buy one through the Brethren company? They're so expensive. And I just had these like light bulb moments. I'm like, the level of hypocrisy in people that are supposed to be, you know, higher up in the hierarchy than me or my family. It just made me think, you know, added to the thought that why am I in this toxic environment?

So yes, they do, but they hide it and go in secret. I just the other day, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2190s) friend of mine was at a music concert and festival and was like, your cousins or your relatives were there. Or they were, they were Brethren there. Like it's all in secret. And I shared in another video of how the first time I ever went to a cinema was with my cousin and we were, knew or saw anyone, but we got home and somebody and the priests were ringing us and saying, you were seen at a cinema. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2221s) the level of control is really, really strict. And you can try and get away with things, but people will catch you out. They're just a bunch of snitches.

Thanks for your questions, guys.

Hey, TikTok family. Another quick one, because I've got to get to work. So what music are they allowed to listen to? And are there specific Brethren musicians or can they listen to any Christian music? Great, great question. Okay. So music, there is no pre-recorded music. So there's a thing called, you know, pre-recorded music, right? Music that is pre-recorded. So you're not allowed to listen to any outside artists whatsoever.

But [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2265s) now and then they'll have this music day or a fun day where they try and raise money for the schools or churches and they will put together, Brethren musicians will come together and play music. Generally, it's pretty backyardish and, but you know, it's all you've got. So people would record it and circulate it. So you'd have Brethren music. You don't pay for it. The only music you kind of pay for is when they do like a school event [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2296s) pay, like put together a, you know, a bang crash choir or band.

And that's because it just sounds pretty awful compared to like proper professional music. It's very backyard and amateur is the word I was thinking of. So that, I recently found some old music that I listened to, some Brethren recordings, and I was just like, God, what was this rubbish? But yeah, even the songs in those days had to be approved and sometimes sentences had to be or verses had to be [edited.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2326s)

So most kids learn an instrument. I learned the piano, my brother learned the saxophone. Most can sing or try to. I had singing lessons, although they don't allow you to have singing lessons. They kind of like encourage instruments, but that's about it. And you, like every family usually has a piano. So you create your own music in the moment and it's usually just hymns from your, from the Brethren hymn book or the book that the approved hymn book [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2356s) they've put together.

So there are Brethren musicians, but not professional, not in any way studied, because you know, tertiary or higher education is not allowed, particularly anything creative, art, craft, interior design, anything like that. And can they listen to other Christian music? No. So you can't just go and get like a Hillsong recording or a, no, because that's pre-recorded music. Some might do, and I know a lot, like I used to have Spotify, but secretly.

I [remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2386s) an interesting story. My neighbor one day, I used to go to her house because we had computers or internet. So I went over to her house and she gave me my first recording on like an old iPod or MP3 player of Ricky Martin's 'Private Emotion'. And I remember having this one song for three years of my life before I went to bed and I'd be listening to 'Private Emotion' by Ricky Martin for like three years straight.

Yeah, so that's the environment I grew up in. It was very quiet. The question is, do they sound similar to Amish folks and what are your thoughts? And I've had other people go, oh, they sound like Jehovah's Witness or they sound a bit like Scientology. In my opinion, I think they're more extreme than Jehovah's Witness because you don't have internet, radio, books, outside influence. So kind of like Amish, but they're not as 16th century. They're a bit more, they're not farmers. They are a bit more, I think, [professional,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2441s) business-orientated Amish.

So, like Amish, but designer, does that make sense? So yes, they can, there are a lot of crossovers and overlaps between other extreme religious groups or high-demand religious groups. And therefore, but just take it to another level, a bit more extreme. And therefore, the way they cut off people or alienate people or discipline people is also more extreme. [Thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2471s) for your questions, guys.

Hey TikTok family, thank you for your questions. Keep them coming. I'm, it's really given me a new lease on life. Not that I needed one, but I just, I found it so fascinating because I'm also like going through this with you in terms of remembering or reliving experiences, but with a different perspective now with seven years on leaving a very toxic environment. And so the question here is, do you ever run into people from [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2501s) church?

Yeah, I do. And because it's such a small, tight-knit community, and if you were different or there was a bit of controversy surrounding your leaving, for example, me being gay, usually you're kind of infamous in there. You're kind of renowned or people know you from everywhere. And being such a small community, you do know people. You know, you instantly recognize families or people regardless of how many years have passed.

So [yes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2532s) I run into them all the time. And being related to a lot of them, that is where it's hard because some people, they're not all bad people, right? It's the environment they're in that is bad. It's the culture it breeds that is bad. It's the, you know, the certain men in there that are the toxic leadership bullies that is bad and ultimately leads to or creates an environment where abusers and bullies [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2562s) know, get away with it.

So they're not all bad. Like I have family and cousins and people, friends that I would call, you know, old friends that weren't bad people. It's just an unfortunate place. So it's very hard when you meet them because you have nothing against these people. You have no resentment to them. It's what they represent or the community they're a part of. So it is hard. It's very traumatic to usually meet people.

I think there was some, in hindsight, I look back now [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2592s) I'm grateful that I stayed in the same town and the same community that I was born in because a lot of people do leave and put as much distance between them and the place of their trauma, right? So in being here, I've been able to deal with it every, the last seven years, seeing them, you know, has made me be like confronted by them and deal with it.

I've had people come into my shop and realize it's me and sort of, like, half squeal. I remember this lady coming in, just like she almost screamed, [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2622s) and turned and fled. And that's kind of like when you've got other people around you, it's kind of like they're like, what was that about? You know, you feel like you're the problem. And I know I'm not. And it's just, it's just a lot of the times that, like, I remember the first time I ever saw my mom, she turned around away. My dad turned, like, this is your flesh and blood.

Another great question. And thank you so much guys for all your questions. I have kind of like talked about this and I'll keep answering this question and doing a video on it every time somebody [asks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2652s) me because I really want to keep sharing my story on how I escaped. And hopefully if somebody is watching this that is in there, it gives them some insight on how to do it. Get your finances together because that's the biggest, hardest, you know, it's financial insecurity that makes people... you know, if you had loads of money, you wouldn't be there.

And not that you need loads of money to not be there. You need to find that balance, right? So you need to have things like your passport. You need to have things like your [Medicare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2683s) card, if you're here in Australia, and your birth certificate is not absolutely necessary because I've helped a girl leave and her mom would never give that up and was, you know, quite, they were quite aggressive about it. So we just, you know, bought new ones, but it's just an unnecessary expense.

You kind of need to set up a network, a support network of people around you that either have been through a similar thing. And I know that can be intimidating because you are taught all your life that the people that leave and speak up, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2713s) myself, are bitter and are apostate and are evil and will just, you know, are the epitome of Satan or Judas. Well, guess what? We're not. We're just normal people that don't have that fear and, you know, going through a similar thing you're about to go through and can probably actually help you escape the same situation we left.

So being excommunicated, though, is different. I wasn't excommunicated. I left, and then I was excommunicated. There's a difference because [generally,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2743s) I found if you leave and aren't excommunicated, I know there's, you know, different cases for different people, but if you leave on your own terms, it's because you've got a severe judgment of the place. You've got a, you know, a conscience of, you know, a morality almost of what the place represents and its leadership. If you are kicked out, it's usually because you've been caught doing something nefarious or wrong, even though they are such grey areas in there.

[So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2773s) I left, and then my grandpa turned up about six months later after they tried all different ways to get me back, very officially. I was leaving my work, I shut my shop, and he turned up and was like, we have to let you know that tomorrow, because once a month they have this care meeting in that they discuss matters like this, and he said, we're going to excommunicate you tomorrow. And I'm like, okay, you see, I'm going to go back to that shop tomorrow and open it up at [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2804s) a.m. and live my life. You're going to be in this church meeting sobbing and howling, thinking I'm destined to hell. And I said, all this is in your head, it doesn't affect me. So what you do in your church is in your head. So that's what excommunicating means. It's so official.

Hey, TikTok family. So I got a few questions about what was school like. So now they have their full, like kinder to high school, their full education in their own [schools.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2834s) But when I did high schooling, so, well, when I did schooling rather, I did primary school. So kindergarten to year six in a normal local public primary school. What was that like?

So we would get picked up every lunchtime by a rostered group of Brethren mums to go home for lunch because the separation rule wouldn't allow us to stay at school for lunch and eat with other kids our age because, you know, [heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2864s) forbid we share a sandwich. So we'd get picked up and we'd get dropped back to the school and we'd always run late and the teachers always hated it. So there was always this angst too about the Brethren community.

I know a lot of teachers felt sorry for us because we were pulled out of every class that, every time they watched a movie, we would sit at the back of the class behind like these folding screens. I remember having my face up watching, you know, *Storm Boy* or *The Chronicles of Narnia*, which were my favorite, you know, movies growing up, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2895s) like just sobbing at the back behind the screen. I remember the teacher coming in when Mr. Percival dies in *Storm Boy* and I remember the teacher coming up and going, why are you crying? I'm like, nothing, hay fever. Like I didn't want, because she would get in trouble if my parents found out that I had watched the movie.

So they were like really strict on it too because they knew how strict this community of Brethren were. So that was my primary school years. And then high school years was the worst like experience [ever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2925s) So if you're bullied, which I was, extensively bullied, bashed, beaten within an inch of my life at church, you're bullied at school because you're going to school with the same kids. So it's a constant cycle and you're not allowed to skip church. You're not allowed to skip school, obviously. So yeah, it's the worst environment if you're at the bottom of the feeding chain, so to speak.

And so they have, as I've explained, just normal studies or school syllabus which is highly edited by the Brethren. That, yeah, it was, they have teachers that are outside the community, but there's like this strict barrier of separation. So they're there to teach, not engage in social activities or get close to. So obviously, there are no Brethren teachers because you're banned from going to university. So there's no Brethren teachers. They [employ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=2982s) outsiders.

I've always been interested to, and I have spoken to some teachers since and to ask them, like, why did you work there? It was such a toxic environment. But some of them have said, we actually just felt sorry for you kids. So yeah, that's a bit about my school life.

Hey, TikTok family. So I've had a few questions about the names or terms, jargon given to insiders, outsiders. Yeah. So [non-Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3012s) members are referred to as 'worldlies' because they are of the world, surprise. And that's interesting. I didn't know they called you 'woodchoppers'. And I think you also mentioned something about outsiders, so like non-Brethren members calling Brethren members 'featheries'. And I've heard this a couple of times and it cracks me up.

So I did some digging and asked some [people,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3042s) and I was like, why were we called 'featheries'? Like, so I in primary school growing up, so obviously I went to a non-Brethren primary school and I was called a 'bible basher' or, you know, as kids do, they have names for, you know, things they don't understand. And the girls, because they wore like scarves on their head, were called 'hanky heads'.

But apparently girls in other, like from older generations, so not '90s babies, like older ones were called 'featheries'. Now, somebody told me, apparently this is because, you know, vanity was such a big thing back a couple of leaders ago. So a few generations ago, so you know, you didn't touch the hair on your head and women had really long hair and you know, that's one of their distinctive [features.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3094s) And apparently the women never shaved their legs either. So they were nicknamed 'featheries'. There's a little bit of fun trivia for you that I dug up. Keep your questions coming guys, I'm loving doing this research and then also remembering, you know, funny little stories. Have a good day, people.

Hey TikTok family, I'm back again answering your questions. Thank you for all the overwhelming support as always. And this question is, have you met up with other people who have escaped the church? And do you have any hope for one or more of your siblings to escape? Okay, first question. Yes, I have got like, as I said before, I've helped like 14-15 people leave. And they're all in my close circle and I love them like family. And then also I've met up with people that left years ago. I have two uncles that left. I've been in contact with one and really close, you know, [close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3148s) to other family members that have left.

That being said, there's not many in comparison because it's such a difficult, traumatic experience to leave. And do I have any hope for my sisters or my brother to leave? No, I honestly don't. My brother was so steeped in that indoctrination. He was just like my father, very much in that. And my last experience with him was of him being violent with me. So I don't really want somebody like that in my life anyway.

[My](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3182s) sisters, and I'll get to that story, but it was the last night of me being in there. I was playing the piano and he just lost it. Basically, he had another cousin in his ear saying, you know, how I was bad for the family. I was a bad influence on my sisters and I was wayward and worldly. And my brother took that on him when he got home, he'd been drinking and got this, you know, violent with me.

So that was kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back. I was like, actually, it's getting physical now. Not just emotional abuse from my father and family and other people. It's now physical and I'm out of there. So, but I'll get into that story more. But my sisters, no.

They have both come to me at different times and said that they would like to leave. This was years ago. But in more recent times, I've heard from inside sources. And I've seen photos. They're both married. So I hope they're happy. And I hope it was their decision. And if they ever see this, know that your big brother is always here and will always have your back. And even if you just want somebody to chat to, I'll be here for you. I'll always believe your story and I would never, ever do what the Brethren do and [victim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3255s) shame.

So I hope that they got to choose their partners. I hope they're happy. And I heard that one of my sisters has a little girl, a niece. So I've got a niece, which, you know, it's sad that I was never, obviously never invited to the wedding or any of this. I'm not privy to any of this information. I just get told it from other people, which, you know, is kind of sad. But no, if they leave, I'm here for them, but I doubt they ever would. Thanks for your questions, guys.

[Hey,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3287s) TikTok family, and another really good question. Finding a new normal was so hard, and that's a great statement, a great way to put it. It was like being a foreigner in my own country, because the irony of this is that I still live in the same town I was born in, and so I was basically creating, I've had to in the last seven years. And so basically, I'm creating a new life with new people in a new world in the same town.

And I [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3321s) these moments where I'm like, I'm having a flashback or deja vu, but with completely different feelings. And I'll explain that. So Wednesday nights, I play indoor soccer, futsal, and that is directly opposite the main church meeting that I used to go to on Wednesday nights here in this town. The only difference is at seven o'clock at night, I drive home that way and I used to drive home that way.

And I, you know, the other night, I think I was like driving home and I [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3351s) a song playing which I hadn't heard for eight years. So back when I was in there, and I had this whole juxtaposition moment of like, I'm driving home to my house, which I love and surrounded by people I care about, to a world that loves me unconditionally for who I am. To friends that I actually have, that I know, you know, I never had friends before.

And I just had this moment of being like, eight years ago, I was driving back the other way to my toxic family home where I used to often think about driving into a telegraph pole. It's just, sometimes I have these most beautiful moments where I'm just so grateful for life and so [grateful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3402s) And so if you are stuck in there within a similar situation, just hang in there because I would never have known that seven years later, I could be living a normal, free life, peaceful life, a happy life, surrounded by beautiful people that care and are interested in you genuinely.

And yeah, so thank you so much for that question. Sorry, that brought up a few emotions then, but, [look,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3432s) I'm very in touch with my emotions and I'm okay with being vulnerable. But yes, it's, as you say, being a foreigner in my own country, I often have those moments, but I love that I've rewritten that narrative in this town. I love that I am creating new memories in the same place where trauma was inflicted. Thank you for your questions, guys.

Oh, this is a really interesting story, guys. And thank you for this question. So buckle in your seatbelts. So question was, I'm definitely comfortable talking about anything, so ask away, guys. When I realized about my sexuality in such a strict household and how did I educate myself? Okay, so sex was a really big to-do, taboo. And so was changing, my changing body, particularly in my family, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3484s) my family, I never heard about it, talked about it. I didn't even know what protection was.

And schools, they don't teach it either, well, not when I was at school, and I left school in 2009\. So I discovered, realized I was gay when I was nine years old. I think I'm a bit more socially-emotionally aware than most other kids my age. So I was very curious as to the boys in my primary school class. I went to a [non-Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3514s) primary school, I'll add that, because the kids at the school were talking about sex and I was like, I don't get that feeling that they were talking about when they were talking about women.

So I, from there and after a while, realized I was gay. I think I was in a shop and I saw a gay magazine or something like soft-porn and I was like, okay, I feel what those boys were talking about when they talk about women and the feeling they got. I feel that about the [men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3544s) I see in that magazine. So that's how I realized I was gay. But interesting, I thought I was the only gay person alive. Obviously, I didn't speak a word of this to my parents.

And so from like nine years old until 14 or 15, I was so alone. I was so alone. I wanted, thought of all, I thought about was, you know, when I'm 20, I'm going to kill myself because I'm this solid, sole gay man. Until one day I saw a book with, I think it was like the [newspaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3574s) with the city Mardi Gras and I was like, oh my God, there's a whole community of them. So I didn't feel so alone, but I didn't know who to talk to.

So one day I was looking through the newspaper, we didn't get a newspaper, but I found the neighbor's one. I was looking through the back and I sort of stumbled across the escort service section and I was reading through and I was like, wow, what's this? And I found the male-to-male part and I was like, oh my God, there is a gay person. [So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3604s) I secretly rang his number on the house number and I got my sex education from an escort for the next four or five years. I would ring him every school holidays, but that's another big story to tell. But yeah, that's how I got my sex education.

Hey TikTok fam. Thank you for this question and great question. If somebody in my situation, for example, not me now because I'm too far gone, like I've got tattoos and I'm speaking out against them. So I'm kind of like a lost cause or apostate as they call it. But if somebody left, and this has happened, and you know, became so overcome with grief and guilt about [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3653s) decision, which is what happens, or they usually run into money trouble to be honest, because you are so well provided for in there.

You are so well insulated from the reality of life, from bills, from, I mean, you pay rent, and from, you know, finding a job yourself. And it's so padded and insulated and protected that essentially being out here in the real world and [surviving,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3683s) it's a lot of work, right? Because life is a lot of work. It's not easy. And I think that comes as such a big shock for people that leave. So eventually they run out of money or they spend like they have a Brethren income and they're notoriously wealthy.

So, and that is the reason people usually go back. And yes, they welcome them back. They love a good, you know, returned prodigal son. They love, they love [using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3714s) those people that come back as examples of what happens when you leave, you know, the horror of what has happened when you've left, you know, they love it. They love and they lap that up when you come back. And I remember people coming back, and I remember I had two cousins that left, brothers, and they left for three years and came back and they became this, you know, victorious story of, you know, they were lost and then found and all this bullshit.

So yes, they welcome you [back,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3744s) and not me because I'm too far gone. I'm a homosexual and yeah, and I've publicly come out and said that and I have tattoos, which you know are a huge no-no. Which is quite interesting because I think somewhere in Revelation talks about Jesus coming back again with, you know, on his thigh it's written King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Which, isn't that a tattoo? Anyway, that's another story for another day.

But yes, they will welcome you back because they love to use an example or make an example of people that have left and come back to be like, see, it didn't work for them, it's not going to work for you. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3781s) they'll get those people to preach and give sermons and they'll sort of make a spectacle out of them. Thanks for your questions, guys. Keep them coming.

Hey TikTok family, I'm down by the river, my favorite spot to meditate and think about life. So excuse me if it's a bit wobbly, the phone, because I'm holding it with my hand. So the question here is, do people come out like, [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3811s) part of the LGBTQI+ community? And it must be terrifying. Oh yeah, it is terrifying. I remember realizing, and I've explained this in another video, but happy to repeat, like tell the same story and elaborate on it because I don't think I did.

I realized I was gay when I was nine years old. So from nine till about 15, 16, I thought I was the only gay person in the world. That was terrifying. So isolating. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3841s) so like, I shouldn't have been worrying about that at that age. You know, I should have been living my innocent childhood. And this is why I explain to people, I might be 31 years old, but I feel like a 78-year-old inside because I feel like I've had to, you know, quickly mature, not that I can't be silly and goofy.

But so coming out, I didn't come out till I was 18\. Prior to that, when I was about 14, 15, I actually, that's another long story, but [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3872s) I'm aware I've only got three minutes, so I actually contacted an escort, gay escort, and basically got my sex education off him. And other times when I'd sneak to the library for a project with my mum and while she wasn't watching or while she was looking at other books, I would be googling gay stuff, I guess, like what it is to be gay.

And so I came out about 18 [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3902s) my auntie and they immediately got priests involved. And I begged and pleaded I didn't want my parents to know just because all my life, you know, my mom had told me at one point, she had told me that if she ever had a gay son, she'd make him have the operation. And I used to be like, what operation? A lobotomy? That's their mindset. They're so like 16th century almost.

And yeah, so I, and they made so many comments about gay people, I just, I was [like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3932s) I cannot shame my parents or disappoint them any more than me leaving would already do that. So I requested that they didn't know, but the leader of the church, Bruce Hales, demanded that they be told, insisted. So the next morning when I woke up after I came out, I found out my parents had been told. I then got shipped off to Melbourne, who I stayed with somebody for a few weeks to, you know, put me on a straight and narrow, not conversion therapy, but kind of. And [yeah,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3962s) it was like a tumultuous journey until I was 24 when I finally plucked up the courage to leave. Thank you for your questions.

When people ask me why I stayed in the little town of Windsor when, you know, one could say I experienced so much trauma, well, this is why. Doesn't even really show how good it is. Wait. Stay right there. I'll be with you in a second. [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=3993s) going to work out how to turn this around. And I want to introduce you to somebody. This is why. And I want you to meet my little girl, Duchess. Good girl. Isn't she the cutest?

Alright, I'm not done with the tour, guys. So this is the town of Windsor. You probably know it if you're from Australia, Sydney. But yeah, we have a beautiful river. There's my little girl, Duchess, and we have this beautiful river where I come every morning and get a coffee and ponder life and enjoy the birds, [fields,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4040s) nature. That is why I stayed in Windsor, because I have a deep connection with this place. I mean, who knows what may happen, but I'm, you know, finding my peace and I'm content here. Stay tuned. I'm going to get to your stories, questions with stories. Thank you.

Hey TikTok family, change of outfit, I know, but surprise, surprise, it does get cold here in Australia if you're not from here. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4076s) yeah, it's winter, almost feels like it. Anyway, so I'm going to get back to these questions because there's a few related to the music, the video I put up about music and growing up with music. So music I listen to now was one of the questions as well. I have an immediate emotional reaction to music or moment, or not, trying to live in the present. So I kind of, whatever the mood is, I listen to.

So yeah, [if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4106s) I need hyping up, I listen to hyping up music. If I'm chilling, chill. But I think I tend to go for '80s, yeah, and a bit of soul, indie. Yeah, it depends on the mood. So somebody asked this question in particular, how does this work with the radio in the car? So the Brethren don't have the radio in their cars. They have it removed and you have to have it removed. And yeah, I remember getting my first car and having to get the radio taken out.

Why? Because there's a scripture [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4137s) talks about the prince of the air or referring to the devil or something coming on the prince of the air or is the prince of the air. So somehow one leader at one point incorporated that into being the radio. So they're not allowed to have radios. And yeah, it's another thing you didn't grow up with. So I never have the radio playing. Someone else asked about going to the shops and hearing music and do you block it out or what do you do?

[No,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4167s) I used to drink it in and like memorize songs from the shops, like from Woolies or Big W. And then some of you might've noticed or growing up, like we used to love the entertainment section at Big W and we would always like run there before our mom could stop us and just like watch whatever we could even though we couldn't really hear the audio.

Or I remember there was a shop [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4198s) like a Westfield called Pumpkin Patch. I don't know if you remember it. At the back, they had like this kiddie's crèche. God, I used to love that place as a kid. Like I remember we'd be like, Mom, you know where we're going to be. And we'd run before she had time to like reprimand us or stop us. And I'd run with my sisters and we'd run to Pumpkin Patch because I was kind of like a tall kid, so it kind of looked weird me sitting in there as a child or a teenager, but my sisters were young enough for me to look like I was minding them. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4228s) yeah, that's where I developed my love of Disney, in the back of Pumpkin Patch in the kids' crèche. Thanks for questions, guys.

Hey TikTok family. I've got myself a cup of tea and the question here, and I've seen a few comments about this, how come their houses have no swimming pools and what's the go with the no pets? So Brethren lifestyles are not meant to be lifestyle, [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4258s) recreational or relaxed, chilled, whatever you want to call it. So it's, we're here to serve God and it's all about the suffering way, no pleasure or pain, basically.

And so no swimming pools. And also, you know, exposed skin usually at swimming pools. So that's the reason you're banned. You're allowed to go to public swimming pools or even beaches, really. I remember going to beaches growing up, but my dad would always, you know, [wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4288s) here and he'd go and, you know, the whole family would wait in the car while he went and scanned the beach and made sure it was an empty beach down in Wollongong or something on a freezing cold day so that we weren't, you know, at a beach full of people with, you know, bikinis on, because heaven forbid this gay man see a woman in a bikini.

And the idea behind no pets is there's no earthly attachments. So it kind of sounds psychopathic when I say it out loud, but you know, they don't want you to form a bond or love an animal or a pet because it means you're forming a bond with something of this earth, of this world. And you know, we are not of this world, we are thinking about the next. It's all focused on, you know, doing God's work here. And I don't really know what exactly they do [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4340s) God's work. But and yeah, so that's why you don't have pets and that's why you don't have swimming pools.

Hey TikTok family. Thank you for your lovely comments too. I get so overwhelmed because I honestly have never been, yeah, I've just, I'm not used to it. It's like, compliment, someone said something nice to me, what was that? So, yeah, as you can probably tell, I didn't grow up [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4370s) people saying a lot of nice things to me. So it's just really nice to, yeah, be surrounded by so many positive, supportive, loving community that, you know, it's just polar opposite to what I experienced. So thank you. You are, yeah, redeeming the redeeming qualities that we look for in humans.

So this question was, have I been able to help others leave the cult? Yes, that's like one of, you know, my little success stories after leaving, actually, one of a few. So I think I've helped about 15 people, or maybe a little less, 14 people to date leave, some which are actually related, some which are not. And it's just such an amazing, beautiful feeling. So as you can imagine, the cult [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4427s) like me because, you know, being a bad influence and all and showing people that you can have a good life out here and meet nice people, actually be happy. So, yeah, thank you for your questions. Yeah, hop on board my little storytelling train. Thanks, guys.

I've had a couple of people say this and I feel like I need to address it. Do I worry for my safety now speaking up about my life there and the things that happen there? Do you know what? In all honesty, I do. Because if they had their own way and they could create law, they would probably still stone homosexuals. That is how, and just from some of my experiences, which I won't go into in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4483s) video because it's not about that, but some of my experiences were very traumatic, like being bullied and the things that happened.

Uh, yeah, it wouldn't surprise me. They have such a vehement hatred and are so homophobic that yeah, sometimes I do. And then they even have a more vehement hatred for people that speak up against it. So get this. And I only like [thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4513s) how bad this is just recently because trauma blocked it out of my mind. So growing up, I remember, and they still do it.

You'd have a prayer meeting on a Monday night at six o'clock or seven o'clock. But if somebody like myself, an apostate, was speaking up against or about them, or just exposing them, they would have an earlier six o'clock prayer meeting where every male would get up and pray for the removal of that person, as in the death of that person. They would get up and pray [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4555s) the death of the opposer.

And you used to seamlessly integrate that into your prayer, pray for the removal of any apostates or opposers. That's me. That's me now. So in doing this, once they find out about this, yes, they'll have prayer meetings to pray for my death. And there was this rumor or like known fact that if the leader did it, if the leader prayed for your removal, you'd have 12 months and you'd be dead. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4585s) I'm not superstitious, so I don't believe in that.

But it's an awful lot of negative and brainwashing that, you know, I have to unpack and undo. I'm not afraid of them. That's why I'm speaking up. And I wish more people would because there are people are terrified to speak up from, you know, the fear of God and what he's going to do because, you know, they're God's chosen people. So thank you for the question and I would like to elaborate more, but I've only got three minutes.

Good evening, TikTok fam. So I just noticed the time. So I'm going to have to wrap these questions up for tonight. I'll get back to them in the morning. Yeah, it's getting away on me. So this question, a bit more serious, is there lots of domestic violence in the community? Yes, like any community, there is going to be domestic violence. But I don't know statistics or figures because that is never talked about. And, you know, I've witnessed that with a family, not my own, but I've witnessed there is domestic violence.

And more so [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4662s) terms, they have a very, they inherently have a bad alcohol problem in that community, which we've discussed already, and they're renowned or notorious for their drinking. So drinking escalates violence. So it's, yeah, they kind of go hand in hand. And I've heard victim and survivor stories of people that were victims of domestic abuse. And, you know, it is common there.

And [probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4692s) more than I know, it's just not talked about. You don't talk about issues or problems. You know, we want to make sure it all looks like there's no issues in the community, like it's all, you know, fine and dandy when it's unfortunately most of the time not the case. So yes, and there are other things like there are victims of abuse, there are victims of harassment, of bullying, of yeah, they are not free from any [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4722s) that. And unfortunately, it seems that the abuses are a bit more rife than other communities because, well, as we've discussed, that type of community lends itself to enable abusers. Thank you for your question.

Hey TikTok family. Good morning. Thank you for all your questions and I'm going to get back to all of them in time. So great question. So did COVID and [its](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4752s) restrictions give any reprieve from constant services and the dinner parties or the Sunday lunches, which is what you're referring to? Yes, they did. I wasn't in there at that point in time, but I heard from my family, well, not directly, but people and people that were in there that have since left.

Yes, because the whole system had to go online. So it didn't change. They still had their meetings every single night. I don't know whether it stayed every single night, [exactly,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4782s) but so they all went online on Zoom. So what they did, they all ended up, which is, you know, unusual for them, investing in a screen, like a bigger, like a TV screen, without the TV, of course, because that's a no-no. And they kind of set up their lounge rooms with the TV at the front like a normal house, but they had like rows of chairs in the same formation as a church.

So the men that, in your own house, [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4812s) sit at the front. So my dad and myself and my brothers, obviously not me, I'm just giving you an example, I wasn't there, but I saw images, sitting at the front with the girls at the back because women are second and have no place, you know, well, they have a place, but it's just not as important. So they would have these Zoom meetings where the speaker or those that spoke would come up, you know, on the screen.

Yeah, so but what I did here [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4843s) a lot of people became accustomed to not going to church or you started to enjoy normal life without this high-pressure timetable, without this, you know, constant people watching you under scrutiny all the time and constantly being accountable. People started to realize how actually simple life can be and how relaxed it can be and enjoyable, peaceful. So I heard a lot of people actually said, I'm never going back.

But then [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4873s) think comes with that, the rest that comes with it, you know, the separation, the losing your family and losing all your contacts, starting your life and your world again. So I feel like, you know, you're caught between a rock and a hard place there. I know some did leave and yes, it gave them a taste for the outside world. But I think ultimately the control of your wider family or your wider community is essentially what kept or keeps everyone back there. I hope this answers the question. Thanks, guys.

Good morning, TikTok family. This is kind of a difficult one to answer. And I like your questions when they're difficult because, you know, I like to challenge myself and just get straight into it. Dating has been hard, and particularly it is already for a gay man in a straight man's world. You know, you're dealing with the ravages of being a gay man in, you know, that internal shame in a straight man's world. So obviously there was no dating before.

I [hid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4932s) being gay or tried to. You're not even allowed to really, you're not allowed to date when you're straight in the Brethren community. It's very organized. It's very, you know, approval is sought for getting married and then you're married. There's no like shopping around, but for the photo books or the catalogs, which I've discussed and we'll do a video about.

So how did, and the question says, how did I navigate the religious trauma that comes with being gay and dating? I think I've navigated [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4962s) pretty well. Like I think I've dealt with it pretty well and deal with it pretty well. I am a huge advocate for therapy. I've had that for like two or three years now. And you know, that started off weekly and it's sort of paired back to twice a month. Yeah, and I've just been, I think I've become more aware and more in touch with my emotions and comfortable with that.

So if I'm sad, sit with that feeling. If I'm happy, sit with that feeling. But know that they're just temporary. The overarching, you know, [feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=4993s) you want is peace, right? Because and I've had, I think the longest relationship I've had is a year and a half, and that was my first. So I don't think I had the best example of, well, I didn't, of what a relationship is, a realistic relationship.

My parents weren't an example of what a healthy, loving relationship is because their relationship was arranged, their wedding, [marriage,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=5023s) and therefore very toxic because of that, because they never really wanted to be with each other and they just don't know that. And then also, so from there, I turned to like fairy tale books, which is an unrealistic expectation or reality of a relationship as well. Like no one lives happily ever after and rides off in the sunset on a horse.

I mean, so both of the places I was getting my expectations from were incorrect. [So,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAqoNkv2ro&t=5054s) I've had to learn a lot about that and learn, you know, what give and take is and compromise. And also I think I've really battled to be comfortable around other men. I've always been mistreated by men or betrayed by men. So I think I've had to work really hard on things like trust or, yeah, so it's a, you know, and I'm a constant work in progress. I'll never be perfect. Thanks.

Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
