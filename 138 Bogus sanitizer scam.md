## Summary

The Brethren's bogus sanitizer scam. How the saints sold 80 tons of tap water as disinfectant in the pandemic!
When the world experienced the tragedy and suffering of Covid,  the Exclusive Brethren saw a golden opportunity to make quick and massive profits. Under the guise of “Caring for all men” and “Helping out in this time of crisis” they actually made matters much, much worse by flooding the market with useless and ineffective illegal disinfectants - all promoted by intensive UBT inspired advertising just overflowing with the most egregious lies and patently false claims. Specifically, this podcast tells the extraordinary story of the Ramsol disinfectant, a Quin Global brand marketed in the USA by Matthew Petersen and in the UK by Carl Fowler. Dean Hales’Ox Tools then relabeled it as their own brand, as did Zappshelter’s Craig Michel, who marketed it as Zapptizer.
This brazen dishonesty and calculated evil greatly enriched numerous prominent Plymouth Brethren family businesses across the USA, Canada and the UK – and of course, the Hales family of Sydney Australia, who dip their greedy fingers into any form corruption that they can find.
We name and shame them all in this raw and uncensored podcast that dips deep into the fetid cesspool that is the PBCC businessman’s moral code of conduct.

We're selling in Canada for $1,790. $1,790 for 22 litres of Omaha tap water. That comes to $81.36 per litre. That's the same price as Johnny Walker Green Label Whiskey. Jeez, wow.

Quin Global, the defendant, for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud that existed from on or about April 1st 2020 to on or about June 30th 2020 and to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=139s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to the Get A Life Podcast. I am Cheryl, and joining me today is Richard Marsh. We're both former members of the Exclusive Brethren, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. In today's episode, we delve into a chilling tale of greed and deception. We'll be discussing Matt Petersen, a ruthless businessman from Omaha, Nebraska, who masterminded a fraudulent scheme that took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic. [Petersen,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=169s) along with several Brethren-owned businesses across Canada and the USA, conspired to make $1.5 million by selling bottled tap water as a so-called disinfectant. Richard is here to shed light on how the Brethren's worldview influenced this sinister plot and how it was used to exploit a global crisis for financial gain. Richard, I am going to hand it over to you now. I want you to tell us how you first came across this criminal scam.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=199s)

Thanks, Cheryl. Yeah, this one nearly slipped under the radar, but we got a tip off. We get a lot of tip-offs these days, and as usual, the source wants to remain anonymous.

Usually if the source wants to remain anonymous, it's because they're actually still inside the Plymouth Brethren cult, and they would be brutally punished for leaking their dirty secrets. But this tip led us to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. The more we dug into it, the deeper and more widespread the corruption became.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=235s)

You wanted to actually call this episode Evil Incarnate. What is it about this particular case that merits such strong language?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=243s)

Well, I've spent the past 10 years investigating PBCC-related corruption, and the crimes I've uncovered take many forms. Some are rooted in the Brethren's deviant religious beliefs, like the abandonment and forced adoption of children, or the racist and homophobic attitudes that persist in there. Others stem from alcohol abuse, which has led to fatal road accidents. Though these crimes are serious, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=273s) often have mitigating factors. For instance, the parents who abandon their children do so because they genuinely believe it's the morally right thing to do based on their deeply ingrained religious convictions. Similarly the drink drivers don't intend to do harm but just recklessness that leads to the tragedy.

But this case was different. This one really sent a chill down my spine because Matt Petersen [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=304s) you know, the same applies to the many, many other brethren who were co-conspirators in this particular crime, but Matt Petersen in particular, his crime was driven purely by greed and ambition. He's already extremely wealthy, has a very good business that's turning over seven million dollars a year, but he craved more. He wanted the prestige that would come with increased wealth in the [Plymouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=334s) Brethren community.

This crime was premeditated, it was carefully planned, it was executed over a course of five months, and it only stopped because the US Department of Justice caught up with him and sent him a cease and desist letter and sent investigators to investigate it. At no point did his Christian conscience step in and tell him that he was doing anything wrong or that he should reverse his course. And even after he was found out, there's not a trace of remorse, there's no shame. In fact, social media posts he's made around the time of his conviction show him goofing off as if nothing significant had happened.

### [**Matt Petersen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=379s)

Hey, I'm Matt and this is me before the hot sauce challenge.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=389s)

The crime was cold, calculated, and extreme. Its victims were helpless and the perpetrator remains utterly indifferent to the consequences. Matt Petersen really is evil incarnate. Under the leadership of Bruce D. Hales, commercial dishonesty and the cruel exploitation of vulnerable people has been normalized, in fact, positively encouraged. As we will see, Matt Petersen's fraudulent scheme drew in multiple other brethren-owned businesses across [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=419s) USA and Canada who became willing participants in the evil conspiracy.

So let's dive in. We'll start by reviewing the US Department of Justice press release. It's a lengthy document, so I've cut out a lot of irrelevant bits, which make it sound a bit scrappy. You can read the full version online and we'll include all the links below.

So this is titled:

“ United States Attorney's Office, District of Nebraska, press release. Omaha Company and Company President plead guilty to COVID-related crimes.”

“United States Attorney Susan Lehr announced today that Quin Global, an entity incorporated in Nebraska, entered pleas of guilty to mail fraud and selling an unregistered pesticide. Matt Petersen, age 39, of Omaha, Nebraska, the President of Quin Global, entered a plea of guilty to selling an unregistered pesticide. Both Quin Global and Petersen entered the pleas of guilty at hearings on March the 19th, [2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=486s) in front of Chief United States District Judge Robert F. Rossiter Jr.

Quin Global is located in Omaha, Nebraska and is a manufacturer of adhesive and tool systems. Matt Petersen is the president of Quin Global. In March 2020, Quin Global began efforts to expand its business by manufacturing and selling pesticides. Now note here that in the US, disinfectant is [classified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=516s) as a pesticide for legal purposes.

Quin Global purchased the product Buckeye Sanicare Lemon Quat from Buckeye International. Quin Global began diluting and repackaging this product into its own proprietary pressurized canister and application systems. Quin Global sold this diluted product as Ramsol RS1, which it marketed as being EPA approved, (that's Environmental Protection Agency approved,) and as being effective against the COVID virus. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=551s) product being sold by Quin Global was not EPA approved, nor was it registered with the EPA, since Quin Global never sought registration for the product.

In April 2020, Quin Global consulted a regulatory consultant, Delta Analytical, regarding the feasibility of registering Ramsol RS1 product, which Quin Global was already manufacturing and distributing. Quin Global was informed of the requirements and did not [seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=581s) to comply with the required EPA registration requirements.

From April 2020 through July 2020, Quin Global distributed Ramsol RS1 to 73 of its distributors in the USA and Canada. These distributors then supplied the product to their own retail customers. Quin Global received numerous inquiries from customers about the product's validity and efficacy. Quin Global repeatedly assured their customers that the product would be effective against viruses and [cited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=617s) the EPA registration for the Buckeye product.

Buckeye Sanicare Lemon Quat was listed on the EPA's list for use against SARS-CoV-2 at a specified concentration. For most of its accepted disinfection uses, it is to be diluted at a 1 to 64 concentration, or 2 ounces per gallon of water. On or about April 24, 2020, [Quin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=647s) Global shipped 72 22-litre containers and 27-litre containers of Ramsol RS1 to Chemical Concepts Inc. in Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania.

In June 2020, investigators with the EPA's Criminal Investigation Division conducted undercover purchases of 7-litre canisters of Ramsol RS1 from Chemical Concepts. The two 7[\-litre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=677s) canisters of Ramsol RS1 that were purchased from Chemical Concepts were sent to the EPA National Enforcement Investigation Center for further testing. The NEIC found Quin Global's product to be significantly diluted, with active ingredients being diluted more than 25 times what they should have been. Ramsol RS1 was diluted to a point well beyond efficacy against viruses, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=708s) specifically the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Between April 2020 and July 2020, Quin Global, advertising this product as being EPA approved and as being effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, sold approximately $1.4 million worth of Ramsol RS1 and $185,000 in related equipment. Specifically, Quin Global sold 1,148 seven-liter [containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=743s) and 3,363 22-liter containers. Quin Global stopped sales after being confronted by the EPA. This case was investigated by the Environmental Protection Agency, Criminal Investigation Division.”

So that's an abbreviated version of the Department of Justice press release. Let's just quickly summarize what happened.

As the COVID pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, Quin Global, a glue manufacturer, decided to profiteer off the pandemic by selling disinfectant.

They bought a proprietary disinfectant concentrate, diluted it and bottled it in their glue containers, selling this as Ramsol RS1. However, they had diluted the disinfectant far too much. There was 25 times too much water in the mix, so it was completely useless as a disinfectant. Anyone selling a disinfectant in the USA is required by law to register it with the [Environmental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=814s) Protection Agency, for which purpose it has to be thoroughly tested.

Quin Global looked into getting EPA registration after they had started selling the product but when they realized what the requirements were, they decided not to go ahead. They just kept selling the unregistered product using the registration number of another to get it to appear to be legal. They were forced to stop sales in July by the Environmental Protection Agency, by which time [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=844s) had sold $1.4 million worth of what was essentially Omaha tap water. Wow.

So what is Quin Global and who is Matt Petersen? Quin Global is a manufacturer and distributor of industrial adhesives. It was founded by Matt Petersen and his father, Jon Petersen. Here's a clip from their website. The clip says;

“Quin Global, meet our team. Our leadership team guides the business toward the future with a depth of experience in manufacturing and distribution.”

 And then it has [Matt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=884s) Petersen, owner, Jon Petersen, owner, Jay Lyons, finance, and Tim Widfelt, product technical.

Matt and Jon Petersen, Jay and Tim are all multigenerational members of the Omaha Plymouth Brethren Christian Church Congregation, formerly known as the Exclusive Brethren. Here's another clip from their website. ;

“Quin Global, we are innovators. We're innovating to bring the future [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=914s) adhesives to market to serve our customers. We lie awake at night thinking about how we can stay one step ahead in a fast-changing world. We want our customers to sleep soundly in the knowledge that our products will never let them down.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=931s)

### Oh, my.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=933s)

Yeah, you can't make this shit up.

Here are the photos of Matt and Jon Petersen and their families from the official church photo album.

So this is Matt and Kylie Petersen and their three daughters.

And this is Jon and Christine Petersen.

And here's a clip of Jon Petersen introducing his business.

### [**Jon Petersen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=967s)

“I'm Jon Petersen. Welcome to Quin Global. In 1979, I founded an adhesive distribution business. In 2008, we decided to take it a level further. We began to manufacture canisters. In 2011, we began using the Quin Global name. And in 2017, we actually spun the business off from the distribution business and Quin [Global](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=997s) became a canister adhesive manufacturing company. So now let's talk about what makes Quin Global unique.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1006s)

And here is a clip of Matt Petersen.

### [**Matt Petersen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1010s)

“Hello, I'm Matt Petersen with Quin Global and today we are in the lab with our P304, a product that was produced almost 16 years ago. So I'd like to show you now how a 16-year-old canister sprays. Be prepared to be amazed.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1033s)

According to a relative who left the cult, Jon is a wealthy, reserved and strictly religious man with a long-standing ambition to become the leader of the Omaha congregation. His only son, Matthew, however, was spoiled as a child and is irresponsible. Members of the PBCC regard themselves as superior to other persons and regard contact with them as defiling, hence they will not eat a meal with anyone except for other PBCC members. This [comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1063s) over very clearly in this 2021 Indeed review by a former employee.

The Indeed review reads, it's titled’;

"Improperly run business". "Family company that was looking to expand presence. Management was very poor and had unrealistic expectations compared to their manufacturing capabilities at the time. They did not have the people to get the product manufactured and space [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1093s) severely limited. Was a very religious environment which is just fine, however their type of religion and beliefs left those of us not in their religion out in the cold. Meetings were cold, they refused to eat with you if not part of their group. Just a strange situation overall. Only good thing was the pay and company car but as a whole their capabilities did not come even close to matching their desire which caused a lot [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1123s) problems when trying to sell their products." Pros: pay, company, car. Cons: unrealistic expectations, feeling like an outcast, poor management.”

As the EPA investigated the crime, they sent CID special agents to interview Quin Global employees, including the sales director, Rob Halverson, who is not a member of the church. Here is a section of that interview that we obtained from the court case documents.

So this is titled;

“ United States Environmental Protection Agency, Criminal Investigation Division, Investigative Activity Report.”

“Halverson stated Quin Global is a faith-based organization identified as being a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He said he was not a part of the church and therefore did not see his employment with Quin Global as a long-term viable position. He indicated the extent of how involved the church was in the business wasn't disclosed to him initially and took a while for him to figure it out. He stated there were just some things he was not comfortable with [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1198s) elaborated by saying, "My daughter would not work there." He also stated employees could only participate in profit sharing if they were a part of the church. He said he holds no animosity and ultimately Quin Global was just not a good fit for him.

Halverson stated the business as the church was very hierarchy based. He said the grandfather Dick Peterson was believed to have initially financed the business. He said the father Jon Petersen, who was the CEO and was a very nice man, added that he saw Jon as sincere and honest.

Halverson said, "Jon would never lie to you, he just wouldn't tell you."

Halverson said he could not say the same thing about Jon's son, Matt Petersen. He said Matt was very ambitious and that he always wanted to go after things. He said Matt was a "ready, shoot, aim" guy, as opposed to his father Jon, who was very calculated in his actions. Halverson stated Matt was not so much, and he saw Matt as spoiled and indulged. Halverson stated Matt was the reason why he left Quin Global, because Matt could not be managed. [Halverson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1275s) said he was brought in to help manage Matt and help bring Matt up in the business. Halverson said there was a point where Matt did not want to be managed and bad decisions were made, this being one of them.”

Wow. Well, that confirms our former cult member's opinion of Matthew. But I have some doubts about how sincere and honest Jon Petersen really is. The same CIA agents that interviewed Halverson also interviewed Jon Petersen in [mid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1305s)\-August. Keep in mind that this whole scam had blown up in their faces in July, and that by mid-August they were in the process of frantically negotiating with distributors to return and refund unsold stock. Jon Petersen must have been frantic with worry and have thoroughly investigated exactly what had happened. But when he's interviewed by the detectives, Jonathan apparently has very little information to offer them. Here's a clip from the interview with [Honest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1336s) Jon Petersen.

“Criminal Investigation Division, Investigative Activity Report. On August the 13th, 2020, EPA CID Special Agent Hugh McCulloch and Special Agent Adrienne Ciolli met and interviewed Jon Petersen and Matt Petersen at Quin Global US, located at 5710 F Street, Omaha, Nebraska. The interview was initiated with only Jonathan present and Matthew joined after the interview [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1368s) started.

When asked why Quin Global began selling the Ramsol product, Jonathan responded, “Well, very simply, you probably have heard of COVID-19." He stated that they had to do something to control the exposure at the Quin Global buildings such as disinfecting door handles and surfaces and he said that other people began asking how they were doing so.”

Let me just comment [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1400s) this at this point. So according to Jon Petersen, they just kind of got into this business by accident. There was Jon in his janitor's outfit, sanitizing the urinals with his handkerchief and a mug full of homebrew disinfectant and a customer walks in and asks him to make a batch for them. So they went for it and before they knew what was happening, they'd accidentally sold one and a half million dollars worth of this stuff. Sounds really plausible, Jon.

Anyway, the interview goes on. Jonathan stated he was unsure of the process Quin Global would have used to manufacture their Ramsol product, but stated there would have been a dilution of the Buckeye Lemon Quat disinfectant. He said the dilution would have been whatever was specified as published on the Buckeye label. When asked if he knew how much Buckeye Lemon Quat had been purchased or how much Ramsol they had sold, Jonathan [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1461s) he did not know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1467s)

So Jon is the owner of the business and the founder of the business. And it's in the middle of a major existential crisis for the business, all centered around the sales of this disinfectant, and he's interviewed by detectives in the middle of it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1484s)

But he doesn't know anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1485s)

He didn't know how they made it. And he doesn't know how much they bought. He doesn't know how much they sold. Doesn't sound like honesty and integrity to me.

Now we know the business and the personnel. Let's take a look at the circumstances that led to Matt Petersen's criminal conviction for fraud.

The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is an exceedingly wealthy prosperity gospel cult led by a tiny clique of Australian billionaires, all of whom are family members or close friends of the cult's global leader, billionaire businessman Bruce D. Hales. The church has an extreme emphasis on wealth and money making, and status within the church is reckoned solely by a member's net worth. When the pandemic struck at the end of 2019, the Plymouth Brethren leadership [saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1537s) a golden opportunity for some disaster capitalism.

Hundreds of interconnected Brethren businesses worldwide, many of which had no prior experience in the medical field, collaborated to scoop billions of dollars of contracts for PPE, COVID tests, hospital gowns, latex gloves, and other pandemic-related products. In many cases the product supply was defective or not as specified, leading to numerous multi-million dollar court cases which are [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1567s) proceeding. In many cases, these uncompetitive contracts were gained by exploiting the cult's extensive mutually beneficial links with right-wing politicians. The brethren's unsavory, opportunistic and exploitative business practices made headlines around the globe.

The largest winner of all was Unispace, owned by Gareth and Charles Hales, sons of the Brethren's secretive global leader Bruce Hales, who goes by the title [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1597s) the Minister of the Lord in the Recovery, or for short, the Man of God. Let's take a look at just a few of these headlines.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1606s)

So the first headline says, 

"The Church, the conservatives and the COVID contracts. A tiny evangelical sect is connected to millions and controversial PPE spending."

And the next one says,

 "Religious sect members who obtained 12 million through Manitoba government contracts run companies out of a co-owned buildings record show."

The next one says,

 "Second company run by exclusive brethren members scoop 100 million in COVID contracts."

And the next one says ,

"Michael Gove lobbied by COVID VIP Lane's biggest winner of PPE contracts. Exclusive. Then cabinet office minister had phone call with Unispace which weeks later got the first of the 680 million pounds worth of deals."

And the next one says,

 "Up to 1.1 billion pounds in government PPE contracts awarded to firms linked to religious sect."

And the next one says ,

"Billions in COVID deals given to firms linked to Plymouth Brethren sect."

"Exclusive Brethren COVID test supplier sets 14 million Hills District record."

And the next one says, 

"Doug Ford's government gave oil company run by members of secretive religious sect millions of dollars for face masks. Other companies run by members of secret religious sect were recently linked to a 2 billion PPE controversy in United Kingdom."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1702s)

It was in this atmosphere of feverish excitement inside the Plymouth Brethren that Matt Petersen had his brilliant inspiration. Quin Global had all the equipment and expertise needed for filling aerosol cans and spraying equipment with adhesives. Why not fill them with disinfectant instead? There was money to be made in a disaster. We get some idea of his thoughts from this LinkedIn post that he made at the time. He quotes Gary Parr, another Brethren CEO, [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1733s) in turn misquotes Churchill.

"Never let a good crisis go to waste."

And this is what the post says. This is by Matt Petersen.

"I have to admit, I got this from one of the CEOs I respect most, Gary Parr. It has such incredible learnings. I just had to share it. Winston Churchill said, never let a good crisis go to waste. Make the most of what you can do."

Jeez.

Despite having zero knowledge or experience in medicine, Matt Petersen set out to follow the leadership of the Hales family and profit from the pandemic. In early 2020, Matt managed to secure a very limited supply of a suitable disinfectant concentrate, Buckeye Sanicare lemon quat.

But Petersen had jumped on the bandwagon too late. As the pandemic ramped up, disinfectant manufacturers couldn't cope with the huge increase in demand and existing stocks were all reserved for emergency and hospital use. So severe was the shortage by April 2020 that many distilleries changed their outfit from bourbon to hand sanitizer alcohol. This is a headline from March 26, 2020: 

"[Taking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1823s) a break from vodka, distilleries making hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 crisis."

Matt Petersen's dreams of making a fast buck from COVID seemed to be thwarted. The market was going crazy for the product, but the supplies were drying up. Here's another headline, this from April the 1st, 2020:

 "COVID-19 pandemic shortage of ingredients delays production of sanitizers."

Quin Global had invested deeply into the disinfectant play. They'd come up with a snappy sounding name and a Ram’s head logo for their new product line: 

"Ramsol RS1 disinfectant spray. Bactericidal, Varicidal, Fungicidal, Tuberculoidicidal. Utilizes chemical known by EPA to kill COVID-19 virus." 

The internet archive's Wayback Machine takes snapshots of websites and archives them so we can [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1882s) how they appeared in the past. This allows us to see how Ramsol RS1 was advertised back in the pandemic. Here is the Ramsol page of Quin Global's website as it was on April the 9th, 2020 at 6:32am. I'll read out some of the key sections of text for our listeners.

"Quin systems that work. Introducing Ramsol. Actively helping the current situation in any way we can." 

Then there's a picture of the bottles of disinfectant. 

"Sanitizer disinfectant spray. Active protection for you. Kills 99.9% of bacteria. High coverage. Fully portable. Here at Quin, we want to help the current situation in any way we can. This is why we have been working around the clock [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1934s) develop Ramsol, which is a sanitizer disinfectant spray to help provide a solution to a safer working environment."

And then there's a headline: 

"How does Ramsol help you? Our aim is to help the current situation by making disinfecting as quick and easy as possible and giving you a system that is guaranteed to kill 99.9% of all bacteria. Ramsol canister is very easy to use and is entirely non-flammable." Well, I guess [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1964s) would be considering it's tap water. "And has zero setup time, therefore helping you to disinfect large areas quickly as it's fully portable and requires no power source."

Then another headline,

 "We wanted to give you a fully proven and tested disinfectant. Quin would only ever want to provide you with a product that is proven to work, which is why Ramsol has been rigorously tested to ensure you have the best product to help [combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=1995s) the current situation. Ramsol is also entirely safe for use on skin, as it is alcohol free." 

It's also everything else free, but they don't mention that. 

"This means that there is no issue with skin drying, irritation, flammability, or even substance abuse." 

That's kind of relevant in the Brethren community. 

"The disinfectant also has active biocides, which give effective and residual action, unlike alcohol-based products. It [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2025s) also food safe and meets BS, that's British Standard, EN1650 and British Standard EN1276 certifications. The disinfectant has a unique dual quat, which provides effective control of the widest range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi."

Next headline. "We wanted to turn our expertise in helping the [community.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2055s) Our people are committed to helping and supporting the current situation in every way they can. This is why we have adapted our existing adhesive production facilities for manufacturing spray disinfection. We want to use our technology to benefit as many people as we can by providing the solution to a safer working environment. All our staff are maintaining social distancing rules in the making of Ramsol, and we are adhering to all guidelines provided by the government and ensuring the [safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2085s) of all staff."

I just want to repeat and emphasize again one line from that long promotional blurb. Keep this quote in mind as we continue the story. 

"We wanted to give you a fully proven and tested disinfectant. Quin would only ever want to provide you with a product that is proven to work, which is why Ramsol has been rigorously tested to ensure you have the best product to help combat the current situation."

While we will never know exactly what transpired, using the extensive evidence presented in the court case, I'm going to try and reconstruct the events that led to Matt Petersen's criminal actions.

Quin's numerous distributors throughout the USA and Canada were advertising Ramsol RS1 via social media posts, videos and phone calls. In the fear and chaos of the early days of the pandemic, orders flooded in for this miraculous product. Matt Petersen soon had $1,585,000 in Ramsol orders on his books and only about 50 litres of disinfectant concentrate with which to fulfil them. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2165s) honest and decent thing to do would have been to postpone the orders and wait for the disinfectant manufacturing to catch up with the demand.

But Matt Petersen was not honest and decent. He was a member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. Lying awake at night, Matthew pondered the problem as $1.5 million seemed to be slipping from his grasp. He realized that if he increased the dilution of the disinfectant, he could fulfill more of the orders. The 50 litres [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2195s) Buckeye Sanicare Lemon Quat that he had in stock would only make 3,200 litres of Ramsol RS1 at the correct dilution ratio of one part concentrate to 64 parts water. He had orders for 82,000 litres of Ramsol. A quick calculation showed that by increasing the disinfectant dilution from one part in 64 to one part in 1,600, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2225s) could make enough product to fill his entire order book. So that is what Matt Petersen did.

To state the obvious, the more you dilute a disinfectant, the less effective it becomes. If you dilute a disinfectant to 1/25th of the correct ratio, it ceases to have any germicidal effect whatever. It's no better than tap water. I'm going to give you an example that brethren members will readily understand. Imagine a glass of whiskey. At 40% alcohol, it's an effective disinfectant, about as effective as correctly diluted solution of Sanicare [Lemon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2263s) Quat. Now imagine you dilute that one glass of whiskey with 25 glasses of tap water. The alcohol concentration is now about 1.5%, less than half the strength of a light beer. It has no sanitizing effect at all.

From the U.S. Department of Justice website, we know exactly how much of this extremely diluted solution Quin Global sold.

"Between April 2020 and July 2020, Quin Global, advertising this product as being EPA approved and as being effective against SARS-CoV-2 virus, sold approximately $1.4 million worth of Ramsol RS1 and $185,000 in related equipment. Specifically, Quin Global sold 1,148 7-liter containers and 3,363 22-liter [containers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2323s) Quin Global stopped sales after being confronted by the EPA."

So that's 1,148 times 7 liters plus 3,363 times 22 liters. That makes a total of 82,022 liters of Ramsol. That's 82 tons of fake disinfectant.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2348s)

To help you visualize what 82 tons of liquid looks like, consider the large articulated tanker trucks that deliver fuel to gas stations. They have a capacity of about 20 tons. Imagine four full-size articulated tanker trucks. That's how much Ramsol RS2 Quin Global sold in the USA and Canada.

Here is a standard one gallon or 2.8 liter jug of Buckeye Sanicare Lemon concentrate. Matt Petersen added just nine of these $20 jugs of concentrate to 82 tons of Omaha tap water to make $1.4 million worth of Ramsol RS1. His total materials, his total cost for materials including the tap water, was about $300.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2405s)

That is insane to see the visual of that. Like, what was he thinking?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2412s)

Well, this wasn't a mistake. This was done perfectly deliberately. He knew perfectly well what he was doing.

So, yeah, there you go. Three gallon jugs of concentrate into a whole articulated tanker full of water. Total cost, $300. Profit, $1.4 million.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2438s)

Oh, that makes me just... What a fantastic profit margin Matt Petersen made. Oh, it makes me want to cry.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2439s)

On the website of one of his Canadian distributors, we found this pricing information. So this is one canister. This is a 22-liter canister of Ramsol disinfectant spray. We're selling in Canada for $1,790. $1,790 for 22 liters of Omaha tap water. [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2469s) comes to $81.36 per liter. That's the same price as Johnny Walker Green Label whiskey.

Between the USA and Canada, 1,125,044 people died in the COVID pandemic. Three quarters of those who died of COVID were over the age of 65\. In nursing homes for the elderly, the situation was particularly tragic. The lockdown made visiting elderly relatives impossible, and many families were unable to say goodbye to beloved parents and grandparents before they passed away. The dedicated staff in senior [care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2512s) homes across the USA and Canada continue to care for both sick and healthy patients at great personal risk to themselves. The most potent weapon in the fight against the spread of COVID from patient to patient was disinfectant. Here are some headlines to remind you of that dark time when hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans and Canadians, isolated from their families, died alone in nursing homes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2538s)

So the first one here says,

 "Canada nursing home reels from death of almost half its residents."

Okay so the next one says,

"Omaha nursing home reports eighth death from coronavirus."

 This is literally from Omaha right where this is happening.

 "An eighth resident at a western Omaha nursing home has died from COVID-19 as Nebraska health officials reported three new deaths and 145 new cases of the virus."

 And the next one says, 

"Outbreaks at seniors homes linked to almost half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada, Theresa Tam says."

The next slide says,

"New York undercounted nursing homes coronavirus deaths by thousands."

And then the next article says,

"Canada's hardest hit nursing homes lost 40% of residents in just three months of the pandemic."

And then it goes on to say "Nursing home workers now have the most dangerous jobs in America. They deserve better."

And then the next article,

"A national disgrace, 40,600 deaths tied to U.S. nursing homes."

And another article, 

"Nursing home lockdowns are forcing families to say goodbye."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2611s)

Into this battle of life and death, Matt Petersen, with cold calculation, introduced 82 tons of Omaha tap water bottled and labeled as a tested and proved disinfectant against COVID-19. How many people died as a direct result of this act of premeditated greed and evil? We will never know the actual number, but we can be quite sure that Matt Petersen and Quin Global have blood on their hands. 

This is Maureen, one of the tens of thousands of care home staff who were on the front lines in the pandemic. Most care home staff are on minimum wage. Their careful and thorough cleaning and sanitizing of all the touch surfaces and equipment in senior care homes multiple times each day was the best hope of preventing the transmission of the coronavirus to other patients or to themselves. Over the course of the pandemic, Maureen and thousands of others like her used Ramsol [RS1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2671s) to disinfect senior care homes across the USA and Canada. Think how many people and how many hours it took to spray 82 tons of disinfectant from aerosol cans, and they never knew it was just Omaha tap water. So sad.

So what were the consequences for Matt Petersen and Jon Petersen from their Plymouth Brethren Christian Church congregation? The PBCC are notoriously strict. [Separation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2702s) from evil is the founding principle of their fellowship. Members have been excommunicated for such crimes as owning a radio or TV, attending a football match or going to the cinema. But in this particular case, there were no spiritual consequences whatever. Matt and Jon continue as upstanding members of the Omaha congregation without any stain on their character.

Why is this? Incredible as it may seem, taking money by deception from non-church members [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2732s) not regarded as a sin. This stems from the brethren's profoundly isolationist us-versus-the-world belief system. To brethren members, the world is a wicked place full of wicked people, and their only purpose in interacting with it is to take what they need from it as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Anyone outside of the exclusive brethren community is disparagingly referred to as a "worldly person" or an "Egyptian," and Bible [verses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2762s) from the book of Exodus are used to justify "spoiling the Egyptians," in other words, taking money from non-brethren.

Brethren are indoctrinated from birth that they are God's chosen people and that God has little interest in anyone else, whether Christian or otherwise. As reported by Australian newspapers in 2024, Bruce Hales once preached,

 "The world is there for our using up of it. The world is there to take what we want from it and leave everything [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2792s) don't want. Spoil the Egyptians as quick and as fast as you can."

Here's an actual scan of a paragraph from the Subject Index to the Ministry of B.D. Hales, a book that every brethren household globally has in their possession.

"We used to be exhorted when we were younger to spoil the Egyptians. That means you charge the highest possible price to the worldly people. That's the way to get ahead. I mean, materially, you've got to spoil the Egyptians. It doesn't belong to them anyhow, so we've just got to relieve them of it. We've got to do it astutely and carefully."

And this was said by Bruce D. Hales in a Bible reading in Papakura, New Zealand, on the 20th of [April,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2840s) 2004\. And that clip is copyrighted by the Bible and Gospel Trust.

Ironically, the PBCC are extremely strict about protecting themselves from the coronavirus. All members had to be fully vaccinated and to take a weekly church-administered COVID test or they were forbidden to socialize or attend  services. But they had no concern at all for the effect of the pandemic on worldly people. It was just a golden opportunity for some disaster capitalism. Even as we write this script in 2025, we [hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2877s) that the PBCC has put all its members in lockdown in the weeks leading up to their universal meetings in New York. All church meetings are by Zoom only, and socializing is banned, all to protect against any possibility of an infectious disease getting into the New York convocation and reaching the Man of God, Bruce D. Hales. Such paranoid extremes against any possibility of an infectious disease getting into the New York extremes to prevent infection in their own community, such callous indifference to others.

Let's look now at the legal consequences of this fraud. Here are the legal charges that were laid against Matt Petersen personally and against Quin Global as a corporation.

"The United States Attorney charges on or about April 24, 2020, Quin Global, the defendant, for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud that existed from on or about April the 1st, 2020 to on or about June the 30th, 2020 and to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, did not only deposit and cause to be deposited matter [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2950s) wit 72 22-liter containers and 27-liter containers of Ramsol RS1 to be sent and delivered by a commercial interstate carrier, to wit RNL carriers, from Quin Global in Omaha, Nebraska to Chemical Concepts Inc. in Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, in violation of Title 18 United States Code Section 1341."

And then this is the charge against Matt Petersen personally: 

"[The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=2980s) United States Attorney charges from on or about April the 1st, 2020 to on or about June the 31st, 2020 in the District of Nebraska, defendant Matt Petersen knowingly distributed, sold, held for distribution, held for shipment, received and delivered and offered to deliver an unregistered pesticide, to wit Ramsol RS1, in violation of Title VII United States Code section 136j (a)1(A) of 136I([b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3010s))(1)(a). United States of America, plaintiff, Susan T Lehr, acting United States Attorney, District of Nebraska.”

The sentencing was announced in August 2024 in a further press release from the US Department of Justice. It says,

 "Omaha Company and Company President sentenced for COVID related crimes. United States Attorney Susan Dear announced today that Quin Global, an entity [incorporated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3040s) in Nebraska, was sentenced on August the 30th, 2024 in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska for mail fraud and selling an unregistered pesticide. Matt Petersen, age 39, of Omaha, the president of Quin Global, was sentenced for selling an unregistered pesticide. Chief United of States Judge Robert F. Rossiter Jr. sentenced Quin Global to a total term of two years probation and ordered Quin Global to pay a $390,000 fine and [$520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3070s) in special assessments. Matt Petersen was sentenced to a one-year term of probation and was ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and a $25 special assessment."

"The defendants in this case perpetrated one of the largest COVID-19 fraud cases related to the sale of unregistered pesticides in the country," said Special Agent in Charge Lance Ehrig of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division in Nebraska. "This [sentencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3101s) demonstrates that individuals and corporations will be held criminally responsible for profiting from false claims that preyed upon public health concerns during a global pandemic and for failing to ensure the integrity and safety of their products."

Given that Petersen had made a profit of $1.4 million on costs of about $300, the $390,000 fine is obscenely low. It still leaves Petersen with over a million of illegally obtained profit. While we would not accuse the judge of any improper motive, we would note that the U.S. justice system is notoriously corrupt and that the brethren have a history of gaming the legal system by offering extremely generous bribes.

As in this Australian case from 2017, in which Dean Hales paid massive bribes to prevent an adverse witness testifying in a court case. Keep the name Dean Hales in mind. He appears later in the story.

Let's take a look now at how Matt and Jon Petersen enjoy their considerable wealth. Both father and son live in some of the most exclusive McMansions that Omaha has to offer. Jon Petersen and his wife, just the two of them, live in this gorgeous 5,425 square foot home with five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3191s)

Well, that's a pretty spacious pad for two people. And now we'll take a look at where Matt Petersen lives. Here's where it gets very interesting. Let's take a look at the timeline. The EPA busted the fake disinfectant racket in mid-2020.

In September 2022, Matthew and Kylie Peterson sold their jointly owned 2,350 square foot family home for $320,000.

In July 2024, just one month before the sentencing of Matt Petersen was announced, his wife Kylie, on her own, bought a 6,743 square foot McMansion for $1.4 million. On her own. Not jointly owned. Why was that? Had she divorced him? No, she hadn't. This is what is politely called [asset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3256s) sequestering. It might also be called laundering the proceeds of crime.

Matthew was facing an unknown but potentially very substantial penalty from the federal court. Even more seriously, he now faces the prospects of civil lawsuits, including class action lawsuits for damages. What if a nursing home that used Ramsol was to notice the court case and connect the tap water disinfectant to the deaths of their patients? [Matthew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3286s) could be sued for tens of millions. But now he is safe. Matthew does not own anything at all. The $1.4 million he made from selling Omaha tap water was all transferred to his wife, who invested it in a mansion. The worst that can happen to Matthew is that he has to file for bankruptcy. The profits from his crime are all safely sequestered away.

We did you an illustration of four large tanker trucks [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3317s) help you visualize what 82 tonnes of water looks like. Can you imagine what $1.4 million looks like? Watch this slideshow of Kylie Peterson's humble abode. That's what $1.4 million looks like.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3419s)

I don't usually quote scriptures on here, but there's one that applies so potently that it has to be said.

 "For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?"

But there is much more to this story than the despicable Petersons. As we said earlier, numerous other brethren businesses in the USA and Canada were drawn into the scam as distributors for Quin Global's enormously profitable bottled water enterprise.

From the court documents, we have identified 13 PBCC businesses that were complicit. Once the game was up, most of these distributors deleted the evidence off their websites and social media, but we have been able to track down five very significant PBCC businesses that did a bad job of covering their tracks. Let's take a look at them. First on the list, Greenpointe. Greenpointe Wood Floor Supplies belongs to the prominent Portland, Oregon [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3479s) leader John Brandsen and his family.

And here's the April 2020 ad for Ramsol RS1. Greenpoint Wood Floor Supplies, April the 7th, 2020\.

"Greenpointe is now stocking the new Ramsol RS1 22 liter disinfectant canisters. There has never been a safer, easier way to disinfect your warehouse, officers' equipment, tools and so on. We are also offering a service where you can bring your van by and we will disinfect the van and tools inside."

"We just had one of our customers get a visit from OSHA and one of the questions he asked was, how are you disinfecting your tools and job site?" Yeah, if only they knew.

And here's Terry Brandsen demonstrating how to assemble the 22 liter canister.

### [**Terry Branson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3539s)

“Hello, this is Terry with Greenpointe and I'm here with our Ramsol spray disinfectant. And we've been trying to get these kits put together for you guys, but some of the customers now a little farther away calling in, we're going to be shipping some of these to you. So we're just going to do a brief tutorial here on how to put together your Ramsol disinfectant spray system. So I've got here, I've got the handle to the rolling cart, there's the spray gun [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3570s) comes with a little brass tip and a gasket. You've got your spray hose, you've got your rolling cart which we'll be assembling here in just a moment. And then of course you've got your tank of the Ramsol disinfectant. So let's get started putting this together. And that is it. You are ready to disinfect with your Ramsol disinfectant spray kit. Any questions, [contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3600s) us at 503-718-0198. Thank you so much.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3605s)

And here are Greenpointe's values off their website.

“ Our values: Honesty. Tell the truth no matter what. Trust. Trust. We test, understand, and believe in our products before providing them to you.”

We've seen no evidence that Greenpointe have either been prosecuted for their part in this scandal or have refunded the many customers to whom they sold these expensive bottles of Omaha tap water.

Next, we'll look at a Canadian distributor, Expertec. Expertec is owned by Mark Bond, the leading brother of the Edmonton congregation of the PBCC.

Expertec is a large international business with branches in Edmonton, Calgary, Abbotsford, BC, and Phoenix, Arizona. The following PBCC members all work for Expertec.

Mark Bond, Wes Bond, Rod Ridewood, Jane Bond, Mark Hewitt, Alistair Hollands, Jordan Simpson, Harrison Biggs, Brent Logan. Here is a post from the Expertec website blog that they forgot to delete.

"Expertec: The Ramsol disinfectant spray is just as amazing. This is a product that quickly kills COVID-19 on nearly any surface as well as a multitude of other pathogens, is incredibly easy to apply, and due to the nature of the chemical has a lasting impact. This is in stark contrast to many chemicals being deployed today which once they flash and the carrier solvent dissolves, lose all their ability to defend against coronavirus [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3715s) any other disease. Yes, we're living in unprecedented times, but our entire team is excited and looking forward to helping businesses and companies like you to stay safe and make your own successful pivots. We are all in this together."

And here is their video to promote the product. In the video, we see an Expertec employee disinfecting an Alberta Health Services vehicle.

### [**Expertec**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3746s)

“It's a simple thing, really. Companies want to protect their employees from disease like coronavirus and even the common seasonal flu. Today, there's really no alternative. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Expertec began to reimagine how our customers thought about fleet maintenance and safety and today we're proud to be able to introduce the Ramsol RS1 disinfectant spray system. The idea was deceptively simple: [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3776s) an aerosol that can quickly kill nearly any pathogen and make it alcohol-free so it can continue to protect for a longer time than traditional disinfectants. Build an easy-to-use sprayer system that's easy to incorporate into any company's daily cleaning or fleet maintenance process. Make the entire process of disinfecting anything—tools, facilities, vehicles, even offices—so simple that there could never be any excuse not to do [it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3807s) That's the Ramsol RS1 disinfectant spray system from Expertec.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3812s)

Next we take a look at another Canadian Ramsol distributor, EZ Stak Inc. EZ Stak Inc. was founded by Mike Lawrenson, the leader and priest of the Kingston, Ontario congregation of the PBCC. It's a large international business with two branches in the USA, in addition to the Kingston headquarters. Members of the Lawrenson family all hold the top positions in the business.

And the clip from the website says,  
 "EZ Stak, our people: Mike Lawrenson, CEO; Paul Lawrenson, VP of Sales; Shane Lawrenson, Senior Sales Director, Major Commands and Programs; Caleb Lawrenson, Director of Operations." 

Here is Senior Sales Director, Major Commands and Programs, Shane Lawrenson, doing a video promotion for Ramsol RS1 bottled [Omaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3869s) tap water.

### [**Shane Lawrenson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3878s)

“Hello, it's Shane from EZ Stak here, here to talk to you about the Ramsol product line that we are now distributing to all of our existing and potential new customers. The Ramsol product line helps you safely disinfect and sanitize your work area, your work vehicle, or your work site. Shortly you'll see how to safely use this product in your pickup truck or your walk-in vehicle.

The product line includes 7 liter and 22 liter canisters, the 6 foot and 12 foot flexible hose, the standard spray gun and the 18-inch wand spray gun which comes with a spray gun tip, and of course the 22 liter canister trolley to help maneuver and move around the 22 liter canister.

The Get A Life team has come across Mike Lawrenson a couple of times previously. In the 2019 Canadian election, Mike Lawrenson, along with Mark Bond of Expertec and 35 other PBCC members and PBCC businesses, donated almost $200,000 to the Canada Strong and Proud right-wing third-party campaign that aimed to [remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=3990s) the Liberal government. The Canada Strong and Proud campaign was notorious for its aggressive tactics and questionable practices. On election day, voters in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec reported receiving robocalls that incorrectly stated voting would occur on Tuesday, the day after the actual election. These calls were traced back to the Canada Strong and Proud Network.

As we are researching this [podcast,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4020s) the Canadian brethren have been holding special 6am prayer meetings in yet another attempt to remove the Liberal government and replace it with their favoured Conservatives. The Conservatives were roundly defeated. Their leader, Pierre Poilievre, even lost his own seat. How did the brethren expect God to hear their prayers when they're carrying on with such wickedness? As the Bible says, "We know that God does not hear sinners."

In a more recent incident, Mike Lawrenson again came to our notice, this time in his capacity as a brethren priest. We obtained a following recording of Brother Lawrenson holding forth on Christian morality.

### [**Mike Lawrenson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4064s)

“We do need to remember is that we're in fellowship together, and there's a big difference between the holy fellowship of God's Son. I would be very careful to put a lawyer's word, and these lawyers, as Mr. Symington used to say, and Mr. John Hales said the same thing, they can argue both sides of the case. We need to be very careful on that. We need to take a position here that the Lord means us to be in fellowship rightly. In order to be in the fellowship rightly, we have to, the first thing we need to lean on is our local brethren and brethren that are trying to help.

I put far more confidence in my local brethren than I ever would have a lawyer. So we just want to be careful on that. We only hired a lawyer because we were told we had to. We were told to get the best we could. We followed counsel on that.

So I think we need to be careful on accepting the word of anyone. I think the Lord, the Lord means us to be thinking according to scripture and according to the truth as it is in Jesus in the fellowship.

And I think personally that if we're going to approach this correctly, we have to look at things from a moral perspective. That's my take on it.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4155s)

That's his take on it, to look at things from a moral perspective.

That is so beautiful\!

 As far as we know, neither Mark Bond nor Mike Lawrenson have been prosecuted for their part in the Ramsol RS1 disinfectant scam, either for passing off tap water as disinfectant or for selling an unregistered product. When we checked the Canadian government's disinfectant registry, we found that Ramsol RS1 had never been approved for sale in Canada.

The next business to look at is Ox Tools. Ox Tools belongs to Dean Hales of Sydney, Australia, son of the Man of God and according to many brethren, his likely successor. What a surprise, what a shock, how bizarre. Something dark and dirty and devious and deceitful and corrupt and callous is proceeding and the Hales boys have their fingers in the pot. How is it that the Hales boys always gravitate to this kind of [filth?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4217s) Why are they such immoral dopes? I put it down to sloppy parenting.

From the court papers, we have an extensive series of emails that show just how deeply Ox Tools was mixed up in this shameless profiteering. 

It kicks off on May the 5th, 2020 with Ben Stevens and John Cunningham, global CEO and global director of Ox Tools, set up a Zoom call with Matt Petersen. Subject: Ramsol [Ox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4247s) Meeting Re: Aerosols USA. Note that Carl Fowler of Quin Global UK is also on the call. We'll come to Carl later.

This development brings us into the inner circle of the PBCC. Take a look at Ox Tools Board of Directors: Dean Hales, Founder and Global director; John Cunningham, Global CEO; Ben Stevens, Global Director. 

Following the Zoom call on May the 7th, Ben Stevens emails Matt Petersen:

"We would like to get Oliver Quincy, Ox Tools [AU,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4291s) to send you the Ox artwork to get a label prepared. Could you also send your flyer to Oliver for us to prepare some marketing collateral? What other marketing pieces need to be prepared? Do you have an SDS and also a detailed data sheet on the effectiveness of the disinfectant? Once we receive the OEM pricing, we can review with the team and get rolling. Thanks for your support. Ben Stevens, Director, Ox Group USA."

On [May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4321s) the 8th, Matt Petersen replies to Ben Stevens. 

"As discussed, we would like a commitment to purchasing in truckload quantities, particularly for private labeling the material. Truckloads consist of 26 pallets and there are 36 of the 22 litre and 120 of the 7 litre on a pallet. Truckloads can be any combination of the two sizes. We can offer the above pricing for a few initial less than the truckload orders to get you [established](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4353s) in the market. Our distributor pricing is also attached. You should be able to sell at the lowest price and still make a reasonable margin. Let me know if there's anything else you need. Matt Petersen, President and CEO, Quin Global."

Once the EPA stepped in in July and banned further sales, Ox Tools received a refund from Quin Global of almost $30,000. But that was just for the remaining unsold stock. On average, the unsold stock in July was just 30% of the total, suggesting that Ox Tools had sold about $90,000 worth of Omaha tap water in just three months. Did Dean Hales, the founder and [global](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4399s) director of Ox Tools care? Not at all. He was far too busy organizing other pandemic profiteering scams through one of his other businesses, 2san Global. Here are a couple of clippings from the renowned Australian newspaper, the Sydney Morning Herald.

"Financial records show Dean Hales' company made an extraordinary windfall from COVID with 2San PTY Limited's revenue, jumping from just $29,000 in 2021 to $739 million the following year with only six employees."

 That's insane.

“A 2San spokesperson agreed that the company had experienced exponential growth because, ‘in short, we made good business decisions.’"

"Records also show hundreds of millions of dollars in complex related party transactions with Tucson's parent company in the UK, in which Dean Hales is the most significant shareholder, and another related entity in Denmark. There were also Canadian and US arms to the business."

And more recently, in July 2023, 2San ran into trouble with the Australian health regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for illegally importing and distributing medical devices, particularly bacterial vaginosis tests and pregnancy test kits which were not included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The 2San spokesman put this down to a [packaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4504s) issue.

The company was also fined $66,000 in 2022 for persistently failing to provide information to the TGA about its rapid antigen tests.

But Ox Tools was not the biggest PBCC customer for Ramsol RS1 tap water disinfectant. That prize goes to SafeSmart Access, who received a refund for unsold stock of $103,426, suggesting that SafeSmart had sold in excess of $200,000 worth of the tap water. And who is the founder and director of SafeSmart? Gregory J. [Hales,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4550s) also known as Greg, the third son of the Brethren's Man of God, Bruce D. Hales.

On May 10, 2024, SafeSmart Access made an extraordinary intervention into the court case in which Petersen and Quin Global were being prosecuted. PBCC member Shane Wearmouth, who heads up the US division of SafeSmart, wrote directly to the judge in an attempt to mitigate the sentencing. Incredibly, the purpose of the letter was to try and infer that this was a victimless crime because Quin Global had [refunded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4589s) customers for unsold stock and that, quote, "none of the customers lodged any complaints concerning the product." I will read the letter.

It's headed "SafeSmart." And it's addressed to Robert F. Rossiter, Jr., Chief United States District Judge, 111 South 18th Plaza, Suite 3141, Omaha, Nebraska, 68102, May 10, 2024\.

"Re: SafeSmart's relationship with Quin Global. Dear Judge Rossiter, I'm writing to inform you of my company's relationship with Quin Global. From approximately March to May 2020, we purchased a disinfectant product, Ramsol RS1, to use as a spray treatment of surfaces to protect against the COVID virus."

"We purchased approximately 900 containers and onsold about 600 of those to our clients. Then we were contacted by Quin to inform us that because the product in the packaged format was not EPA registered, Quin requested that we return all unused product, approximately 300 containers, which we did soon after. Quin reimbursed us for the full price we had paid and in addition paid the freight. None of our [clients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4673s) lodged any complaints with us about the product. In summary, we did not suffer any loss because of our relationship with Quin regarding the Ramsol RS1 product. I'm available to provide further evidence if the court requests. Yours sincerely, Shane Wearmouth, SafeSmart, Los Angeles." 

Let's look now at that recall letter that Quin Global sent to all its distributors once the EPA had caught them red handed. It says, 

"Valued distributor, due to a misunderstanding between the EPA and Quin Global US regarding Ramsol RS1, we will no longer manufacture or distribute Ramsol RS1. All existing orders will be cancelled. We will cease to take new orders and [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4726s) marketing of RS1 will cease until resolved."

"We are asking all our distributors to cease the sales, advertising and marketing of Ramsol RS1. Please remove any Ramsol RS1 internet reference or likeness. Quin Global US would like to immediately recall any existing Ramsol RS1 distributor stock back to Quin Global US for refund or credit, whichever is preferred by the distributor. Some EPA registered [disinfectant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4760s) alternatives are listed below." 

And there's a list of disinfectants.

 "To arrange shipment of Ramsol RS1 back to Quin Global US, please email us specifics at..." 

that's the email address.

 "We apologize for any inconvenience. Please refer any questions to Rob Halverson, Sales Director, Quin Global US."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4780s)

Okay, let's pause here because this is... I've been just holding back my insane passion over this. So why wouldn't have this been a massive thing that was put out to anybody who may have purchased this off of all these different businesses? Just like Costco does, right? Or when something goes bad and they do a recall...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4807s)

Like a car recall. Like, "There's a fault in your car's brakes, bring it into the garage, we'll replace it or else it may cause a fatal accident."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4815s)

Yeah, or simply just Costco has lettuce that gets recalled or something. You know, I mean, you hear about it. Because the thing is, at this point in time, this becomes a little personal for me because my husband had received his heart transplant during COVID and then got COVID, but we had multiple AHS people come back and forth from our house during this and they easily could have brought COVID with them. Maybe that's how my husband got [COVID.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4845s) I don't know.

But at the same time, this letter doesn't even address the severity and the criminality that could have happened from all of this. And we don't know how many people died from this. And I find it hard to believe that the people that were in charge of all of these businesses did not know. Maybe the employees didn't know. But I truly believe that. I find it hard [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4875s) believe that the people that own these businesses didn't fully know what was going on. I think that they did. And I think they might have held it from other people around them. But on another scale of this, this should have went out to the news. It should have went out just like anything else is recalled. "Anybody who has purchased this, please note that it wasn't just a misunderstanding. It literally was just tap water."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4902s)

Yeah, exactly. I mean, this is what's so striking about the recall letter is it's just going to the distributors. There's no suggestion that the distributors should then inform the retail customers who are actually continuing to use this incredibly dangerous product. It's not dangerous in the sense that it's poisonous, but it's dangerous by omission in the sense that it's actually just tap water, and they're spraying it around to [disinfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4932s) things in the middle of a deadly COVID pandemic.

And it's just staggering. I mean, what the recall letter should have said is something like this. It should have said,

 "Please urgently contact every customer who has purchased this product from you and tell them it is not effective at all against COVID and that they should stop using it immediately."

 But no, it's very clear from the SafeSmart letter that they never informed their customers of the danger they were in. [How](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4962s) incredibly callous and immoral is that? They asked their distributors to remove any Ramsol internet reference or likeness. Why? Because financially, it was in their selfish best interest to creep away quietly and hope that no one found out and sued.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=4982s)

Yeah, it's just so freaking heart wrenching. I spent four years disinfecting my house from top to bottom daily to keep my husband alive during this because he was in the very, very prime stages of recovering from a heart transplant. And to know, like we lived in Edmonton, like we were around these places. It's just so disheartening the amount of [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5013s) that could have been affected by this. It makes me just want to sob right here and realize the gravity of the situation. And this is the letter they get sent out. Not sufficient at all.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5026s)

Yeah, I mean, these are... like we said, these are people, the people who do things like this, they're people who've lost their soul. Yeah, I mean, these are exceedingly wealthy people. I mean, the Hales are billionaires, all the others are multi-millionaires. They didn't... they've all got perfectly good businesses of their own. They've got really good, viable businesses. They didn't need to jump into the pandemic and try and make some extra cash on the side. Exactly. Pure [greed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5056s) Pure greed.

So here's a table of all the brethren businesses in the USA and Canada that we have found who were selling this fake disinfectant. We've got a column for the business name and a column for the owners or the principal persons in the business. So starting from the top:

 SafeSmart, Shane Wearmouth and Greg Hales;

 MBM Wholesale, Tim Walker of San Antonio; 

Ox Tools USA, Dean Hales, Bob Critchley, Ben [Stevens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5089s) and John Cunningham; 

EZStak LLC, Mike Lawrenson and numerous other Lawrensons; 

Applichem Inc, now called Forza, Rick Glenn, Rob Glenn, and Mike Glenn;

Archmill Housing, Brad Buchan, Steve Buchan, Larry Buchan, and Curtis Buchan;

 Powerpak Civil and Safety, Judah Fawkes

Ironclad Company DBA Terrain Seattle, Earl Gracie, Russ Gracie, and Neil Gracie; 

Greenpointe, John Branson and the Branson family;

Clear Design, Rob Warrilow, Luke Warrilow,, Leonard Warrilow,;

 HGH Granite, Don Hardwick, Gred Hardwick, and Neil Hardwick; 

Expertec Van Systems, Mark Bond and numerous other Bonds;

Anadyne, Larry Branson; and 

Benchmark Industrial, Bob Hughes and Kylan Hughes. 

All brethren businesses, UBT businesses, all profiteering off the pandemic with an entirely fake disinfectant.

So while Quin Global and its 13 brethren distributors cashed in on this evil scheme and counted their profits, all across the USA and Canada, their ultimate customers—the nursing homes, schools, tradesmen and families—were left in the dark, trying to fight off the pandemic with extremely expensive tap water.

You might think that's the end of the Ramsol story. You might think that there's so much vice and corruption that's been laid out over the past hour that it's time to end the podcast and say goodbye to our patient viewers. But no, there's more. There's much more. As so often we find with the PBCC, once you start to investigate some local scandal, you find it has spread and multiplied and mutated. It is much larger and uglier than at first it appeared to be. [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5211s) the proverbial iceberg, nine-tenths of it is underwater. It's out of sight. Until you get into a submarine and do a deep dive. Now it's time to look at how the Ramsol scandal unfolded in the UK.

Here's a snip from the Quin UK website.

"Quin Global. We strive to treat our people and our customers with loyality, honesty and integrity."

Loyality, that's a new word. OneSchool Global, that OneSchool Global education really shines through. But we'll focus on the honesty and the integrity and see how they measure up to that.

Remember that Carl Fowler who was copied into the Ox Tools emails? Carl heads up Quin Global in the UK. And he also decided to get onto the PBCC Pandemic Profiteering Bandwagon. And here's Carl Fowler on the subject of Carl Fowler. 

"Carl Fowler, Managing Director. Visionary leader and people-first collaborator, driving strategic growth and long[\-term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5283s) ESG sustainable business. Global innovator in aerosol and canister adhesive solutions." 

Carl is a remarkable salesman. He's been trained by UBT to fake sincerity so perfectly, you might almost believe that he was sincere. Let's listen to Carl Fowler's Ramsol disinfectant sales pitch.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5308s)

“Hello, so my name is Carl Fowler. I'm one of the owners of Quin Global. Traditionally, we're an adhesive manufacturer. But Quin Global is also the home of the Ramsol spray surface disinfectant sanitizer. The Ramsol brand is the most renowned brand and the first brand of the spray surface disinfectant sanitizer in a canister concept. So I just want to just go over very simply…”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5333s)

Let's unpick some of this bullshit. "Ramsol is the most renowned brand and the first disinfectant spray sanitizer in a canister concept." This was the launch video. How could it possibly be a renowned brand? And as for the first spray surface disinfectant canister... Here's a Lysol disinfectant aerosol advert from 1968\. So good luck patenting that one, Carl.

### [**Lysol Ad**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5361s)

“Now, at the touch of your fingertip, you can help protect your home from household germs and destructive mildew. New Lysol spray disinfectant, the pleasant way to eliminate germs, mildew and the odours they cause even in spotless homes. In the shower, for example…”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5377s)

Okay, that's two lies in 22 seconds, Carl. Let's see what else you have to say.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5383s)

… just go over very simply as to why and when we actually bought the concept to the market. At the start of the pandemic, it was very evident that we needed to bring our values of the organization to life and that really came out in one of the key lines that we have is that we care and value others. And that's not only the people within the organization, but that's our communities around us, the people around the globe. As a global manufacturer, we need to [consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5413s) the whole globe in relation to this pandemic.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5416s)

Sorry, I'm getting a bit choked up here. Carl, pass the Kleenex, “Care and compassion for others all around the globe.” God loves all the little children. What a beautiful, altruistic motive, Carl. Let's keep going.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5432s)

“So with the adhesive side of the business, we decided to pivot and change some of the production lines into sanitiser production lines, putting two additional production lines in to actually facilitate the overall need there was in the market. So that's the reason why we bought the Ramsol material to market. It has a strong, credible value to the user. It's fully backed up by [third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5462s)\-party test houses for its efficacy. With the product in its own right, there's a finished item that's in the total delivery system. It actually covers and maintains a 99.999% which is everything you can possibly imagine you need from a surface disinfectant or sanitiser material. So that's the story behind the reason that Ramsol was created and presented to the global markets.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5493s)

Whoa, "fully backed up by third-party test houses for its efficacy." "It covers and maintains a 99.999% efficacy." Impressive. "That's the story behind the reason it was created." You're good at telling stories, Carl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5512s)

Yeah, I think all his stutterings and ums and this and that might have been his guilty conscience.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5517s)

“The Ramsol product has been fully tested by an external test house to the 14476 standard. The 14476 standard covers all virucidal testing for viruses, including coronaviruses, inclusive of SARS-CoV-2, which is the reason behind the COVID-19. The Ramsol product is a must-use disinfectant surface sanitiser for your environment, your space, whether it be on hard or soft [surfaces.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5548s)”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5555s)

So Carl is doubling down on the third-party test house and that it's certified to British Standard EN14476 and British Standard EN1276. But there is even more in the post that accompanies the video on Quin Global UK's Facebook page. It says, 

"Ramsol kills 99.999% of bacteria and has been tested by third-party testing houses to the below standards: British Standard EN 14476, British Standard EN 1276, British Standard EN 1650, and British Standard EN 13697."

Now there's four British standards that this product has been tested for [by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5609s) third-party testing houses. But let's take a closer look at these claims. Here is a clip from the video. On the aerosol can, it clearly says "kills 99.999% of bacteria." But here's the strangest thing. On every other image of the UK Ramsol disinfectant spray I can find on the internet, it looks like this.

Spot the difference. Now it only kills 99.9% of bacteria.

That is a 100-fold decrease in the efficacy of the product. But that's a problem, because if the product really meets British Standard EN1276, it must kill 99.999 percent of the bacteria, because that is what the standard means. So does this product really have those test certificates from third-party test labs that Honest Carl has doubled and tripled down on? Or is it just that there was a shortage of [nines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5677s) in the pandemic?

Let's do a really deep archaeological dig around Ramsol, UK. An internet search reveals seven businesses distributing Ramsol in the UK and Ireland. Five of these are brethren-owned. They are;

 Quinn Global of Perth, Scotland, Alistair, Carl and Lloyd Fowler; 

Elmbridge Supplies of Gloucester, Angus, Barry and Rory Freeman; 

Eureka Global Limited in Newport, Wales, Alex, Daniel and Richard Nunn; 

ISB Group Limited in Birmingham, Mark Fishwick, Alan Grinnell and Clive Grinnell; 

Wise Safety Limited in Liverpool, Lisa and Maxwell Horton. 

And then additionally, there's GRP Solutions in Portsmouth and Indesol in Walsall, UK, and Lisbon in Ireland.

On May the 4th, Get A Life podcast sent the following email to all seven businesses. "Urgent. Legal issues re: Ramsol disinfectant product. Attention business owners, I'm investigating the Ramsol disinfectant product advertised on your website and have compelling reason to believe that you have been selling an unregistered disinfectant contrary to the Biocidal Products Directive for the UK and all the Biocidal Products Regulation [EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5761s) number 528/2012 for Ireland. This is a criminal offense."

"Your website and advertising and the product packaging also claims directly or indirectly that Ramsol is certified to one or more of the following British Standards: EN 14476, EN 1276, EN 1650, and EN 13697\. Please provide by return a copy [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5791s) the relevant British Standard certificates from an approved laboratory to verify these claims and a copy of the registration of Ramsol on the authorized biocidal products list maintained by the Health and Safety Executive and all the list of biocidal products authorized on the EU/EEA market in accordance with the Biocidal Products Directive 98/8/EC."

"Should I fail to receive a prompt response, I will have no hesitation in placing the matter in the [hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5822s) of the relevant authorities and then denouncing any illegal activities in the public domain. You should take into consideration the recent prosecution of Quin Global USA for selling an unregistered disinfectant." 

And there's a link to the Department of Justice press release. 

"Sincerely, Richard Marsh, Get A Life podcast."

To these seven emails, I received no response.

I then did some further research online and found one document that purported to be a British Standard Test Certificate for Ramsol. Here it is.

At a glance, this would appear to be a certificate to say that Ramsol was tested to the British Standard EN 14476 Standard. It's titled "British Standard EN 14476 Documentation." But it's nothing of the sort. Just above the table there was a carefully worded sentence that is an evasion, a deliberate insertion of weasel words, a cunning dodge that makes the whole document an [exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5892s) in deliberate deception. This punchline comes just above the table where it says, "Biocidal efficacy of Ramsol RS2 based on the active ingredients." *Based on the active ingredients*.

What that means is they have simply estimated or projected what the expected performance of the sanitizer would be based on the chemicals they put into it. It also proves that the [sanitizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5922s) has never been tested as a finished product because if it had, it would say, "based on laboratory tests of the product," and the certificate would have the name of the testing laboratory on it. Let's give you an analogy. Imagine you're stopped by the police while driving and they ask to see your driving license. You either have a valid driving license or you don't. It's no good saying, "Well, I'm a good driver. Watch me parallel park. Watch me do a three-point turn. I obviously could pass the test if I was tested." [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5953s) don't have a license. You can't be legally driving the car, period. If you say you have a license, you're lying.

This document was evasive enough to prove to me personally that Ramsol had never been tested, or that if it had been tested, it had failed. But to be absolutely fair, I emailed Carl Fowler personally on May 7th to give him every chance to prove that he was not a liar before we published this podcast. Here's what I said. 

"[Legal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=5984s) issues re: Ramsol claims. Hi Carl, you have repeatedly and publicly claimed that your Ramsol product is third-party tested to meet several British Standards. You also claim honesty and integrity as core values of your business. Despite extensive inquiries and despite emailing seven of your UK distributors requesting the certificates, I've been unable to find any evidence whatever that Ramsol is certified or ever has been certified to those standards."

"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6015s) is your last chance to validate those claims. I also note that Ramsol was never registered as a disinfectant with the Health and Safety Executive as is required by law. Selling an unregistered disinfectant is a criminal offence. I'm giving you a full and fair opportunity to justify yourself. If I do not receive a satisfactory response by the weekend, I will publicise this issue as widely as possible and notify the relevant authorities. Sincerely, Richard Marsh, Get a [Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6045s) podcast."

Carl's reply came the same day.

"Re: Legal issues, re: Ramsol claims. Dear Richard, thank you very much for your message and for bringing your concerns to us. We can confirm that we were fully compliant with all applicable HSE and VPR regulations during the period Ramsol was on the market. The product was fully tested and approved in line with the relevant standards at the time. Should you wish to take this matter further, I would be happy to put you [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6080s) direct contact with our legal team who is fully aware of the situation and prepared to handle any additional requests. Thank you again for your understanding. Warm regards, Carl Fowler, Managing Director, Quin Global."

Carl had confirmed nothing. He'd provided no Health and Safety Executive registration number, no certificates or any other documents to show that the product passed the four British Standards he claimed. Just some abstract [waffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6110s) and a veiled threat about his legal team who is "fully aware of the situation." I suppose that was meant to frighten us, but it didn't. That's why you're watching this podcast now.

Let's be absolutely clear. Ramsol is not on the UK Authorised Biocidal Products Database. You can search the database online. There is no Ramsol on it. There are no products at all by Quin Global on it. Same with the EU Biocidal Products Database, which applies to the cells in Ireland. It's not on the database. It's an unauthorized biocide. Ramsol has not been tested by third-party [laboratories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6154s) and certified to pass British Standard EN 14476, EN 1276, EN 1650, and British Standard EN 13697\. This is all fake. This is all lies. This is all entirely fictitious. Carl Fowler deliberately and knowingly created this entire farrago of falsehoods and then he makes a video of himself looking straight into the camera and spewing out lie after lie after [lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6184s) while giving the impression of profound sincerity and concern and compassion for mankind. Let's listen to it again.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6192s)

Hello, so my name is Carl Fowler. I'm one of the owners of Quin Global. Traditionally we're an adhesive manufacturer, but Quin Global was also the home of the Ramsol spray surface disinfectant sanitizer. The Ramsol brand is the most renowned brand and the first brand of spray surface disinfectant sanitizer in a canister concept. So I just want to just go over very simply as to why and when we actually bought the concept to the market. At the [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6223s) of the pandemic it was very evident that we needed to bring our values of the organization to life and that really came out in one of the key lines that we have is that we care and value others. And that's not only the people within the organization, but that's our communities around us, the people around the globe. As a global manufacturer, we need to consider the whole globe in relation to this pandemic.

So with the adhesive side of the business, we decided to [pivot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6254s) and change some of the production lines into sanitizer production lines, putting two additional production lines in to actually facilitate the overall need there was in the market. So that's the reason why we bought the Ramsol material to market. It has a strong, credible value to the user. It's fully backed up by third-party test houses for its efficacy. [With](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6284s) the product in its own right as a finished item that's in the total delivery system, it actually covers and maintains a 99.999% which is everything you can possibly imagine you need from a surface disinfecting or sanitiser material. So that's the story behind the reason that Ramsol was created and presented to the global market.

### [**James Tully**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6312s)

Hi, I'm James Tully, owner of Limitless Fitness 24/7 Cumbernauld. We've been looking for the best way to sanitise the gym and keep the members safe against COVID-19. I feel by far this product is the easiest, most convenient way to do so. I spray the machines down, the dumbbells, the cardio area, the whole gym within 5-10 minutes and I'm looking forward to hosting the gym and keeping the members safe.

### [**Carl Fowler**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6335s)

The Ramsol product has been fully tested by an external test house to the 14476 standard. The 14476 standard covers all vericidal testing for viruses including coronaviruses, inclusive of SARS-CoV-2, which is the reason behind the COVID-19. The Ramsol product is a must-use disinfectant surface sanitizer for your environment, your space, whether it be on hard or soft surfaces.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6370s)

Wow, that poor gym that was having, you know, using all that disinfectant and how many people come in and out of a gym, right? They just don't realize how widespread they made this issue.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6384s)

Absolutely. Yeah. Well, you might have thought that was the end of the story.

There can't be any more evil pandemic profiteering going on around this disinfectant, can there? Oh, yes, there is. It's called Zapptizer.

Zapptizer is the brainchild of Craig Michel. Craig is a well-known Brethren member from Perth, Scotland, the same Brethren congregation as Carl Fowler.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6414s)

There's actually another connection between Craig Michel and Carl Fowler. They are brothers-in-law. Craig's wife Libby is Carl Fowler's sister.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6424s)

Here's a news clipping about Craig Michel.

"110 mile an hour shame. A businessman was clocked doing 110 mph on his way to church in a blizzard and with two children in the back. Craig Michel, 32, led police on a 16-mile high-speed chase as he raced to the Brethren church in Kirkcaldy. Yesterday, Michel of Lauder Crescent, Perth, who already has six points on his license, was banned for a month at the Perth Sheriff Court. A sheriff [spared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6458s) him a six-month ban due to the effect it would have on his building supplies firm." Wow.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6464s)

And I just want to reiterate that that was 110 miles per hour, not 110 kilometers.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6470s)

Yeah. Yeah. In a blizzard with two kids in the back. And again, just a staggeringly light sentence. The influence the brethren... I mean, no doubt he got a QC, an absolute top lawyer to defend him and he probably paid 100,000 in legal fees, but he got off with a one-month driving ban. That's ridiculous.

Craig's business is called Zappshelter. He sells agricultural buildings, but in 2020 he [suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6500s) decided to set up a sanitizer business called zapptizer.com. Here's a blurb from Rocket Reach about Zapptizer. 

"Zapptizer Information: As COVID-19 began to spread westward, we realized that by mobilizing our contacts and expertise we can make a real difference to people's lives in these challenging times. As a team we have always been adaptable and able to think outside of the box, [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6530s) we turn our attention to developing a product that would continue to enhance our motto: Protect what matters. We harness the expertise of a local specialist adhesives manufacturer and work with them to create Zapptizer, a world-class disinfecting surface sanitizer which has been thoroughly tested and certified and is effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19."

"Initially, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6560s) rolled out our product to our core businesses: construction, plant, rental, waste, recycling, storage and distribution, but very quickly it gained traction in other areas such as car dealers, rental companies, fleet operators, community transport operators, local authorities and the police force. No matter how big or small an organization, we are here to help you to protect what matters. Your people deserve to feel safe, so reassure them with [Zapptizer."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6591s)

Just note that line, "we harness the expertise of a local specialist adhesives manufacturer." Craig Michel is from Perth in Scotland. Carl Fowler is also from Perth in Scotland. The specialist adhesives manufacturer was Quin Global. And here is the product.

It's just Ramsol with a new label. Just as Ox Tools had their own label version of the Ramsol RS1 in the USA, Zappshelter had its own brand of Ramsol RS2 in the UK. Zapptizer has never been registered with the Health and Safety Executive as legally required. It is therefore a criminal offence to sell it in the UK.

According to the now deleted zapptizer.com website,

 "Kills 99.9% of bacteria. Typical applications of Zapptizer. Extensive lab testing on Zapptizer formulations means that it is the number one trusted brand for many industries throughout the country."

 Extensive lab testing indeed. Perhaps we should ask Craig for the certificates. Here's a LinkedIn post from Craig's little brother, Russell Michel. 

"As lockdown [gradually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6681s) eases, should we relax our precautionary procedures? Zapptizer is a quick and easy prevention, fully certified and made in the UK."

Craig Michel was very successful in selling Zapptizer. Several other PBCC businesses got in on the act and helped him distribute this untested and illegal product throughout the UK and Ireland. These businesses are still advertising Zapptizer online.

A couple of examples of these Zapptizer distributors are On-Site Support, founded by Richard Lynes, prominent Plymouth Brethren member, who is passionate about helping the disadvantaged.

And another Zapptizer distributor is Rockforge, run by Ian Record from Luton, who has a passion for plant. You should note that all Brethren businesses claim that they are passionate about things. It must be in their UBT marketing manual.

Look back to Scotland. Here is a very disturbing newspaper article from 2021\.

It says,

 "Elderly or vulnerable residents can use Caithness rural transport for vaccine appointments."

And there's a picture there of a minibus driver sanitizing his vehicle with a disinfectant spray. And the caption is 

"Caithness rural transport driver Andrew Sutherland demonstrating a Zapptizer device which allows disinfecting sanitizer to be applied to vehicles by a spray mechanism."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6787s)

It just makes me feel sick to my stomach.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6789s)

Yeah, elderly and vulnerable residents and their transport is being sanitized with Craig Michel's fake disinfectant. Shame on you, Craig. There is so much more that we uncovered in our investigation, but we're out of time. To finish off, we'll take a quick look at the kind of penalties that Carl Fowler and Craig Michel might be facing if they're convicted of selling an unauthorised and untested disinfectant. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6819s) is a case that finally came to trial in April 2024, although the offence took place in 2020\.

The headline is 

"COVID hand sanitiser fraud pair sent to prison."

“A father and son living near Thornbury were both given prison sentences at Bristol Crown Court yesterday for defrauding customers of their business at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic over a hand sanitiser product which was described by an expert as being useless. William Irving, 69, and Alexander Irving, 35, both of Woodend Lane Hill, South Gloucestershire, were sentenced to two years and two months each in prison by His Honor Judge [Cullum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6865s) for what he describes as their callous profiteering.

The pair ran Aquatic Chemicals Limited from a unit in Woodlands Farm near Berkeley in Gloucestershire and during March 2020 at the outset of the COVID pandemic started to produce and sell a product called Shield Hand Sanitizer for up to 10 pounds for a 100 milliliter bottle. The product labeling claimed an alcohol content of 70%, that it could kill 99.9% of germs and was effective against [coronavirus,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6896s) and indicated it had been laboratory tested by the World Health Organization..

Trading Standards raided the premises of ACL in July 2020 with police and secured further evidence for offending by the Irvings which showed that during just two weeks in March 2020, they made minimum sales of 24,515 bottles of Shield Hand Sanitizer, generating an income of approximately 95,000 pounds plus [unquantifiable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6926s) cash sales. Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Irvings were prosecuted for fraudulent trading offenses under the Companies Act by South Gloucestershire Council and initially both pleaded guilty to them at Bristol Crown Court during January 2023\.

In sentencing yesterday, His Honor Judge Cullum said it was necessary for him to revisit the time of the lockdown in 2020 when there was widespread fear of [death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6956s) and serious illness and hygiene and social distancing were part of everyday developing government instructions. He said the Irvings clearly knew the product was not what it purported to be but persisted in preying on public fears of an unprecedented national emergency. He further noted that William Irving in particular knew of the importance of proper labeling and honesty regarding the product he sold but concluded that ‘lying [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=6986s) be said to be your natural bedfellow. ‘“

And that really brings us to the heart of the matter. The common factor that ties together all these dodgy deals and devious dishonest doings is the willingness of Plymouth Brethren Christian Church businessmen to shamelessly and repeatedly tell lies.

When I was growing up in the Brethren in the Symington and John Hales eras, lying was regarded as the most dreadful of sins. It was regarded as the sin that was particularly associated with Satan himself, so much so that the word "liar" was effectively a swear word and you had to use a euphemism for it. All that changed when Bruce Hales took control. He preached that the brethren should be ruthless in business and "take what we need from the Egyptians because it doesn't belong to them." [As](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7038s) for lying, he leads by example, sending out brethren spokesmen, starting with his own brother Daniel and then going on to the current incumbent Lloyd Grimshaw to issue patently false statements to the media, deliberately bearing false witness to the whole population of Australia.

And what is the brethren's plan when they're caught out lying? They tell a whole bunch more lies to cover up the first lie, as we have just seen this month with Grimshaw's absurd denial that the brethren were organized to mob polling booths to influence the federal election in Australia.

In closing, an appeal to those current members of the PBCC who are watching this video. According to your own doctrine of separation, you are required to withdraw from iniquity. According to your beliefs, if you break bread with a wicked person, you become contaminated by that wickedness too. It's time to ask yourself the question, why am I still breaking bread with such evil persons as Matt Petersen? Why am I content to be [led](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7108s) by liars and crooks, persons who have gained the whole world in luxury living but have lost their souls? And can a church that goes to great lengths to both privately encourage and publicly cover up fraud of this kind really be God's chosen special people on earth? Don't you think it's time to get out of the cult?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7129s)

And I would add to that, in regards to the whole lying bit, that now they view treachery. Treachery is worse than stealing. So they have replaced lies now with the word of treachery. So if you go against what they're doing, that is the worst sin. And I can guarantee you that treachery is not the worst sin.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7153s)

So what they call treachery is what we call whistleblowing. In other words, if you're a member of the cult and you report on any of this criminal activity or dangerous fraud to the police or, you know, God forbid, to us people that they call opposers, you're regarded as a traitor and that's regarded as a far worse crime than the crime you're reporting on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7177s)

Yeah.

Yeah. So it's not true, right? I mean, you guys all know inside there that after you hear these scandals one after the other after the other, it's getting to that point where you just need to leave. Just get out and, you know, claim what little bit you have left and rebuild.

I appreciate you, Richard, coming on and explaining all that for everybody. That was laid out very well in black and white and yes, we will be sending this to the appropriate people that we need to. And you know, coming from a personal interest in this in my own self is, yeah, this very much needs to be dealt with. So thank you so much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxj9ykx7xo&t=7218s)

You're welcome.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
*   **Rapid Relief Team (RRT)** – The PBCC's emergency and disaster relief organization, generally recognised as a corporate sanitizing and PR initiative.
*   **Gospel Hall Trusts**  – Legal entities that own and maintain PBCC meeting halls and church properties across various regions.
*   **Bible & Gospel Trust** – The official publisher and distributor of PBCC-approved religious literature and scriptures.

This summary is provided for clarity, as these organizations are often referenced in connection with PBCC operations, outreach, and influence.
