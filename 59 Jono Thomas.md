A podcast guest that hails from the Land Down Under, Jono Thomas joined us with a story so shocking it shook us to our very core.

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future.

They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get a Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

You matter and so does your story.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=60s)

Hello everyone, welcome back to Get A Life podcast. We are here today with a special guest, Jono. He's coming to us all the way from Australia and we have got a crazy story for you today.

Jono, welcome to the podcast.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=81s)

Thanks very much. I really appreciate all your time you guys put into it. I really enjoyed that. I've actually been quite keen on watching the videos. Yeah, I love them.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=95s)

We spoke briefly. Huh? Sorry.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=100s)

No, go ahead. I was going to say, yeah, so I was one of seven children born in Ballarat. I was number six of seven. I've actually got a photo here of our family. Oh, family, yeah, yeah. And I realized, well I didn't know that at five years old, when I started primary school, I was keen on the Carlton, like this Australian AFL football club.

And I remember just being mesmerized by [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=138s) men running around with white shorts. And I probably didn't know what it was or whatever. Anyway, my primary teacher kept the recording because she knew we didn't have a TV, because they won the premiership for two years.

And then when I got to, I think it was when I was nine, I told my dad that I want to work on an aircraft as a flight attendant. And that's when he realized that I was gay. [So](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=168s) they used to tie me to the kitchen bar stool with mom's pantyhose so it didn't mark my skin, and yeah, try that conversion therapy stuff.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=180s)

So they tied you to a chair and tried Christian conversion therapy on you?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=189s)

Where would they get an idea like that? I don't know. I think the reason why they use mum's pantyhose or stockings was so it didn't mark my skin, so that there's no evidence of it hurting me. Yeah. But then as I went got through, was growing into my early teens, I still often help mum in the kitchen and I used to love doing gardening.

My actual full name is Jonathan, and then my nickname in the church was [Jonty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=220s), but then my family started calling me Jonty because I was helping in the garden, like they thought I was a sissy, like I was being girly. And then sometimes I was made to sit separate at mealtimes and stuff, because I was different.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=238s)

They made you, they made you eat separately from them just because you were different from the whole family?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=245s)

Wow, yeah, because they obviously, they realized I was gay. And then, so I literally just tried to, then I basically faked it. And then come to when I was 16, because my dad and mom were quite wealthy with a good big family business, we had a double story house and I was upstairs and I was gonna jump out head first and commit suicide.

Because I just, I couldn't work out why God would make me a dud. I just couldn't work it out. Like, there's no, there's no two ways about it. I was like, at five years old, I didn't as if I'd choose to be, yeah, [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=290s). Yeah. And I was gonna jump head first, yeah. And I thought if I'd go head first, I would break my neck. But then I went to jump and I thought, oh, I'll just give it one more day. And I'm still here today.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=303s)

Wow. Wow. Wow, Jonathan, wow. Oh my god. Oh, I'm so glad you just said, I'll give it one more day, you know?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=315s)

Yeah, was it something that you never talked to them about? Like, is it something, was it a conversation they were open to having with you?

**Jono Thomas**

 Yeah, they were. And like, because I had that big family, I had lots of nephews and nieces, and I was never allowed to be on my own with any of the boys. My dad would never let me, in case I contaminated them.

And also for interchange, like we need to change in Ballarat we interchanged with Stawell and [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=345s) on Wednesday or Thursday nights, and sometimes Saturdays. And there's always a bus, but I always had to sit next to my dad so that I didn't touch any other boys. Yep, let me sit next to him. Wow. It was pretty, pretty intense. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=365s)

That is, anyway, I don't even know what to say to that. Like that, the bullying that you went through, holy cow, it was insane. Absolutely insane. How did that carry into school? Because you would have been in the public school system back then, right?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=374s)

Yeah, so I was taken out at the start of year 11, so like my second last year. It started the Brethren schooling in year 11, yeah, but it was just done by correspondence. Oh, okay, okay. Yep.

**Lane Admiraal**

Did the rest of the kids, sorry, did the rest of the kids at school treat you differently?

**Jono Thomas**

 No, [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=404s), no, no, because it was probably, no, that's fine. I literally faked it, faked it till I make it, basically. I had to, there's no option. You know, I'm still here today.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=417s)

Wow. Did you ever meet any other young people in the church that you felt maybe were the same as you, that were gay?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=428s)

Definitely. There was a couple others in Ballarat and, yeah, definitely. Yeah. And I actually once had an encounter with one of them. And so then we ended up moving when we got married, because my son had autism, we ended up moving to Hamilton, Victoria. We pulled both our kids out of the school because my son was being bullied with his autism.

We enrolled in another Christian school. And when [Bruce Hales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=464s) heard of it, because that school said that they can't afford to pay for a teacher's aide for my son. And then when we got the message to Bruce Hales, he said, he actually, he stuck up for us actually and really said, we've got enough money to support seven teachers' aides for you. Like, there's plenty of money in the system.

So then they suggested that we move to Hamilton because my brother Daniel down there [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=494s) a son with spina bifida, he was in a wheelchair. And so yeah, we moved down there. And when I was down there, this guy that I actually had this bit of an encounter with in Ballarat confessed.

So I haven't got, I was about five years, so my ex-wife, she knew about five years before we left the Brethren that what I was battling with, but she thought I was overcoming it and keeping on going. And so I don't know, I literally just [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=524s), literally, and then I turned to alcohol. And that's when you'll see the photo of that, sorry, after the big when I was so fat. Yeah, yeah.

**Lane Admiraal**

So back pedals a little bit. So you get through high school, and you decide you want to get married. How did that all pan out for you? 

**Jono Thomas**

Well, I, yeah, well, there's no option. Like that, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=554s) no, I literally, and I like, I did like, I still love my ex-wife. She doesn't, she, they've gone back now, my son and her, but yeah, honestly, I had to literally click it.

It wasn't, I asked her out and she actually was clever. She said, because I thought it was all, I rang her dad and I thought it was all sorted, it was going to happen. And then she, when I rang her directly, she said, just give me some time to think about this. I'm not sure that you're the right one. But she told me afterwards she was just doing that to coax me on. But we had two kids, a daughter and a son. And then yeah, and our first few years of married life in Ballarat was, we sort of, we were entertaining, we, yeah, we were very happy. Yeah, good, good, wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=618s)

That must have been very, that must have been very hard. You said that they've gone back. I can't imagine how hard that is.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=628s)

And I've seen some, the police have called around and done a restraining order against me now from my son. So like, never to do with him again. It's pretty immense. And because he had high functioning autism, and not like, he had intense bullying at the school. Like, I looked after him, you know, day in, day out. And it's really, really hard to, but gotta push through.

Yeah, wow. What was the reason that they would have taken out a restraining order? What did they expect from you? I don't, I think they just didn't want me to have to do, like, because he sent me a text message and said he doesn't have anything more to do with me again. And I think it's just reiterating to make sure I don't. Right. That's what it is. And it's just the Brethren controlling, I can tell. Right, right.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=684s)

It's the hatred that this cult somehow has towards other human beings, right? Because of one orientation sexually or anything, right? How you're born. And they just hate it for some reason. They just hate it. And it's so unnatural to hate and to hate, especially the ones that you know that you love, right? Like their heart, in their heart, they obviously love you, right?

But they're [brainwashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=714s) to think that they need to cut that off somehow. And my only hope is that once people have seen the other side, even 10, 15 years later, you can realize that maybe this place isn't making me as happy as I thought it was going to, right?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=737s)

That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I still, like because my son had an Xbox and like, he'd be able to have all that in there. Yeah, yeah. So unlike, yeah. And the thing is, he was extensively bullied, insane, at the Brethren schooling. I think I told you, Lane, that they had him lined up with rulers measuring his penis. And the teachers couldn't do anything about it.

Because the main bully, [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=768s) dad was one of the trustees. And one of the teachers brought it up in a meeting, and that this trustee said, don't you ever say anything against my son again, otherwise we'll sack you. So then the only way, like my son, the only way for him to even change his new sport clothes was to go into the disabled toilet.

Because one time they tried flushing his clothes in the toilet even. Like, it was insane. I went to the police about it, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=799s) they, I said, I don't know how, I wanted, you know, what I do about this stuff. And they said, like, it was an offense, like it would easy, but they said they didn't, they didn't think I was, the pressure that would come from the church, like it would be a massive inquiry into the school funding and all that stuff. They didn't think that, I thought they put it back on me that I should pursue it or not. So I just left it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=822s)

They basically said it would be too big of a deal. Like, oh, then we'd have to investigate the church, we don't want to do that.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=830s)

Yeah. And I knew the pressure that would be put on back on me. Wow, yeah. So, wow, it's pretty intense. And that's why, yeah, it's really, really hurtful that he doesn't want to have anything more to do with me. But yeah, I'll just, I think as you say, Lane, there's always hope.

Yeah, yeah. What do you, what do you, what do you see the future of the whole bullying in the school? Like, now that you're out of it, do you think there's a way to go back and make them pay for how they treated him? Like, can you make a report after the fact? I could do, yeah, but, yeah, whether, I don't understand how it would go down with this new restraining order that with him and then going back in. But they probably wouldn't really appreciate it, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=890s)

So someone has brainwashed them into filing a restraining order against their father. You know, it's just like, this is the level that this mainstream Christian church is at, right? Just this normal church that has Rapid Relief Team charity, it's just normal, right? This is, they file restraining orders because their father comes out, [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=920s)?

Like, oh, the sickness that is involved in their minds. I'm just so sorry you had to go through all this, Jono. But I'm also, like, my heart is warmed by the fact of how happy you seem now and how you want to advance your life and how you're living open now and seemed very happy, very positive person. I'm very blown away by that. It's amazing.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=950s)

And to get a job with Qantas. I've actually just resigned because Air New Zealand have offered me a job now. Wow. Good for you. Congratulations. Yeah, thanks. One of the passengers I was flying with was a hostess for Air New Zealand and she saw, well, I don't know, but she saw that I have potential. So she said, can I put a word in for you to, can you come over to New Zealand? So yeah, I'm doing that, starting next week. Good for you. Good for you. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, it's just great. It's good fun. I love, I love airplanes.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=987s)

So this is, so this is really a childhood dream coming true, isn't it?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=994s)

Oh, extremely. And this is what I'm, like, at nine years old, I wanted to be. I've got a photo, I don't have it on me now, but I've got a photo of me blowing, you know those recorder whistle things? I did that and I was practicing doing the, you know, the announcements for the, you know, the safety demonstration with blowing a whistle for the, I love it. Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1024s)

I always have a special place in my heart for childhood dreams that come true, you know? That's awesome. That's really awesome.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1035s)

Wow. It's real good, yeah. So, yeah, what else do I have to talk about? I have some notes here. My daughter left at the end of November 2019\. And it was on a Wednesday, and I can still remember, I've got a tattoo on the back of my leg of a time on the clock when Kerry rang me to say Jolinda, it was 17 minutes past 8\.

I can remember on the 20th of November, Kerry rang me to say Jolinda's left home. And she left a really lovely letter on the fridge, and all trace of her was gone. Like her passport, everything, she disappeared. So like, you know, it's just like, you know, as you know, it's like a death.

So I was at my workplace, working for my brother, and I rang the leading head guy in Hamilton and he said to go to the police station. So I went into the police station, I said, I'm Jonathan, I'm just coming to, no, I've just come to report my daughter's missing. And they said, oh, you're Jonathan. I said, yeah, how do you know that? And they said, oh, your daughter's already passed through here and told us what [she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1107s) doing and giving us a new number and she's 18, back off, leave her alone. Wow, she's very clever, very clever.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1120s)

And so then, then so she's getting guidance, sorry, you go ahead. No, I was thinking that she was getting guidance on how to do this from someone, most likely.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1127s)

Yeah, all right, yeah. So she actually, she wanted a high, in Australia, you need a high ATAR score to get into university. So she worked out when she was in year seven or eight, that if she was studying French, and she realized that in French was one of the highest, if you pass high in French, you get the highest ATAR score to get into university.

So she worked out that if she took on French and kept it up, that she'd be able to get into [university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1159s). And she convinced us by the second last year of her school that the Brethren computers weren't giving her enough, like they were blocking her from, you know, fully studying French because it stopped, I think they did French in the first couple years for study and then they stopped it.

But she kept on doing it by correspondence afterwards. And so by year 11, she convinced us that the Brethren computers were blocking her from [fully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1189s) completing, you know, being able to study. So then we just went down to the electronic store and brought her an open computer, like a non-Brethren one, just so then she could do it. But that way, and that was her tool to escape. But she was able to access the outside world.

And it was, it was a girl, it was a girl that's left from outside in Melbourne that come up, she drove like three hours to pick Jolinda up. And yeah, and then I, so I went back to the police station and then that the message got to Bruce Hales and he said, there was three words, go get her. Like he was just said, because they didn't want her being, her virginity being wrecked or whatever. And literally, literally what the word was, go get her.

So [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1235s) day for five days, I had to go to the police station under direction. But the priests would go around my house and went right through my emails and just trying to trace down anything that they could find where she would be. And then I worked out that I could put, because she changed her phone number, and I worked out I could put some money into her account, her bank account.

And I, like, you know, you can put a message. I'll put, dear Jolinda, please contact dad. And then I put some, like, $500 cash in there. And then the next day, I did it again, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1265s) I saw the money had gone out because it was a joint account that her and I had. And then on the second day, I went to put the money in and it bounced back because it had been closed down.

So I rang my bank manager because I was a joint owner, they said that the account was closed down, I think it was South Melbourne. And that message got back to Melbourne priests, and there was about five priests walking around the streets of South Melbourne looking for her. This poor girl was just, I can, I [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1295s) understand why she did the restraining order because she was, she would only ever come out on Sundays because she was scared because people would track her down. Wow, it's just insane.

And yeah, so then on day five, because I used to go to the police station every day, next thing the police turned up my door with a restraining order against me from her. But it wasn't against me, it was just the Brethren. It was like the... Back then, she, because she was only just 18, we had to have a special permission for her to get a mobile phone back then.

It was like back in 2019, you had to be over, I think you had to be over 18 to be able to have a mobile phone. But we used my son's autism as an excuse for her to get one because we said, oh, we can't use carers, so can my daughter look after her? So from 16 years old, she had a phone, but the condition was, and she signed it, that I had to, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1356s), she couldn't take it to bed at night time. That was one of the conditions of the UBT, in case she does anything illicit.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1369s)

So just to be clear, sorry, I just want to clear something. So your daughter filed the restraining order while you guys were still in the church? Yep, okay, okay.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1380s)

Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1381s)

Sorry, I didn't understand that at first, sorry.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1383s)

Yeah. Yeah, sorry, yeah. So, and like, I understand, like going to the police really, and this poor girl being hunted down. And I think she soon worked out that the Brethren were trying to hunt her down. So I can, I can understand her doing it. But, and but that's this one's, her was running, it was for six years and I'll come up to year four now.

So wow, actually Mick Davis is going to try and help me to connect with her again. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1420s)

Right.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1423s)

Hopefully she sees this. Yeah. And the thing is, I admit, like, I was a controlling dad. Like, we, our carrying, my ex and I, we used to help at John Gadsden's with Bruce Hales several times. And we used to always help at Sydney fellowship meetings with Dave Hales, because Kerry, my ex, her auntie is Emily Hales, who married Dave Hales in Sydney.

So we were always, and it was just this controlling, like this almost this role model that you put up to, to be this [controlling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1454s), you know, dad, and you know, have real strict rules and stuff. So I'm like, I admit, I really regret my controlling attitude, but it was just what I was, the influence was under, under Bruce, if that makes sense.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1469s)

Yeah, yeah, you know, like when you're in an environment like the church, right? There's this, there's a certain aspect that's, that's, you only know what you know, right? You only know what you know in there.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1486s)

Yeah. I know, yeah, absolutely. And I'm, and it was just, I'm a awesome, I mean, it's pressure from, I guess, because I was writing in the inner circle, like especially helping at John Gadsden's house with Bruce Hales several times, it was, I guess it was, you took on this sort of role model, immense pressure to be controlling, and if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah.

**Carman Drever**

This is a little bit off topic, but we keep hearing stories about alcohol use at the breaks and at these special meetings and stuff. Describe what that's like, you know, as a household helper, you're probably the guy serving the alcohol. 

**Jono Thomas**

Yeah, absolutely. And I used to, and that was the thing, like because I'm like, I turned to alcohol to cope with who I was. And in 2014, it because I had thyroid cancer, I had my thyroid removed.

And balancing out the medication, and I went to my doctor and said, can I have some help? Because I can't, I can't go a day without alcohol. So he gave me the medication to get off it. But on day two, the medication didn't work. I had this shocking withdrawal. And I'll stay, I was at home from work. And when Kerry took the kids to school at 9am, I went to the bar and had some drink.

Because I had to still, there's in having the Sunday lunches, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1581s) had to still stock the alcohol and serve it to Brethren. Yeah. But then I went to hospital and I went to ICU. And my body literally, one time, one day, four, I woke up and I couldn't walk or talk. My body was starting to shut down. So they put me in ICU. And on day two, they, the doctor told Kerry and the kids that I won't be coming home, I'm dying. But I didn't want to die. I just stayed awake all night.

So, but then on, and then when as I recovered, like I went literally from a wheelchair to a walking frame and had speech therapy and all this, as I recovered, I told my doctor that at the Sunday, or you know, the Lord's supper, they have port. And he said, no, you can't have it. They have to change it to grape juice.

So we, Kerry told that to the leading priest in at Hamilton, and he said, no, we can't, that [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1643s) biblical, we've got to have port. So I had to have, literally had to, every Sunday morning, I just put the, I just faked it and put the cup up to my mouth. And it's like hanging, dangling drugs in front of someone who's come off drugs. I had to put the cup up to my mouth. And then as it went around about two or three people, I would just pull out my hanky and wiped off my lips so then I didn't have any craving for it. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1666s)

Wow, it's just insane. Wow, the fact that they wouldn't allow you to do that. Like, like that they insisted that you drink alcohol when you're literally in recovery. That is just shows the level of these fake Christians, right?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1683s)

Oh, totally fucking fake. Just, yeah, just, yeah. It was just insane. Literally, because then when I left the Brethren, I got a job at the hospital and then I got a position in helping young kids get off drugs and alcohol. And you just realize that it's just so cruel. You know, what you know, making me sip this port every Sunday morning.

And like, and they'd watch me. Like, and if I didn't have it, say I pass it through, like I did it the first time, I didn't have any other person on, and I got in trouble. I wasn't allowed to do that. So I had to pretend to just put up to my mouth.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1730s)

And I'm real, like what would happen? But I'm like, like, I don't get that. Like, what happens? Do you get a bad point? Like, if you don't take a sip or something? Like, they're just so, they're so insane with their beliefs that they actually think that their creator would get angry if you didn't partake in a sip, even though this person is struggling with alcohol addiction and is in recovery. You know, I have no compassion there, right? Like, like, what kind of insanity is are these beliefs that the Plymouth Brethren [Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1761s) Church have?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1765s)

Yeah, it's just insane. But then my brother Daniel, in August 2019, my brother Daniel passed away from alcoholism. He, his eyes started going yellow and his hair started falling out. And he called me around because his doctor had, he sent a message to me and said, oh, can you come around? And I could just tell it was quite, he wanted me there pretty quick. It was on a Friday evening and we're having dinner.

And so I literally just [dropped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1795s), I said to Kerry, Daniel's messaged me, I think it seems urgent, I'll go. And I went around there and he had just had a word back from his doctor that his liver was failing because of alcoholism. And he said, I want your help. I want your help because you've got through it. So we sat down the back step and he like, cried, we totally talked for several hours.

But then the following week, the doctor did more tests and he found that one of the fine lines of one of his antidepressants were, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1825s) says can possibly have liver damage, but it's like any fine print of any medication. So from that, he thought it was because of the medication. So he went back on the drink and literally everything, two months he passed away. And that was August 2019\. I've got a photo of him with him. I mean, he was, he was my best friend. Like he was, he was, he was like 18 months older than me.

He never knew, I don't think, I was gay, but like he was just, he, because we wanted to leave earlier, the church, but and he was the one that kept me, kept us in. And we, we had good old heart to hearts, had lots of talks... And you'll see of my Facebook page, I've got a poem I did about him. But yeah, so that was another three. And so then, and that was, so that was August 2019\.

And every day [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1884s) would go around and help his ex-wife, sorry, sorry, his wife with their son who's in a wheelchair. And it was in that time, I really regret because I should have been probably putting time into my family. And my daughter underway with planning leaving home. And so she left in November 19\. And then yeah, we decided on day five that because we had this really bad church meeting on, was on Sunday after she left home.

They, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1914s) we, Kerry, my daughter and I used to go to the gym often and we had a key to the back door. The boss gave us a key so we could get in there because we weren't allowed to go to gyms, we’dpark our car in the back and hide it.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1930s)

Of course, because the brethren hate gyms.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1932s)

Yeah, and we used to let her wear makeup. And this was, and so on the Sunday reading, that was just a dreadful reading. But this guy was taking the reading, just put it back on us. You know, we let the world in and that's why you lose your child and all this stuff. So that's when Kerry and I and my son, we just literally zipped up our Bibles and walked out. He never went back. 

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1955s)

Wow. Wow. Incredible. That took a lot, man. That must have taken incredible strength.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1965s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1966s)

Yeah. I do have one thing I want to ask you about is the specimen jar prank.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=1978s)

So one of the worst bullies to my son Jake, it was his dad that was the trustee, that one that told the teacher that he, you know, if you say anything against my son again, I'll sack you. I, because I had, sorry, I had thyroid cancer, I've got to every six months have, do bloods, specimen jar just to make sure the cancer's not bad. And I faked that I dropped my jar and it was now no longer, [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2008s), because that's me, you know, clean like contamination.

I went back and got a spare jar and I filled it up with this yellow food dye and wrote on the jar, Terry Arckoll, all the guy's name, like that, like this trustee. And I said to be taken midstream and put this like scribble the doctor's signature. And then that, the main, you know, the, you know, the big halls they used to have, the men's toilets on the side of the foyer. And like, there's four basins lined up.

And because he was so religious, he looked like always there half an hour early. So we got there about 15 minutes early. And when I walked into the hall, there was no one in the toilet. So I was able to just sit this jar on the basin. And then I got out again and I went, oh my God, just stood in a cubicle next door to the basins. And I just like, I pretend I was, I just said like that people would know I was just still there and was just listening to people come through just laughing, say, oh, Terry's left his wee jar..

And as everyone coming up in the church, this ripple went around the hall. Like you could see people would like laughing at each other. And then after the meeting, after the church, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2082s) little kid took the jar up to him. He said like, here's your jar. And he hadn't, it was when he was talking to the priest. Oh, it was the best. I just love doing pranks on those people.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2095s)

That is amazing. Oh, that is funny. What a great prank.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2101s)

That's awesome. Oh yeah, the moral of that story is don't ever try and get on the wrong side of Jono. 

**Jono Thomas**

No, I wouldn't do it to you. My last Sunday lunch, we had, you know, you know Lindy Jacomb? Yeah, yep. Her auntie married Ben Morton in, he's now gone back to Adelaide, but he was in. And because there's so much pressure to have good quality scotch and cognac and stuff, and I went to the Aldi store and just got the cheap brandy.

And I kept the good cognac bottle and I filled it up with the Aldi. And he would, because I would ask, I would be like, and I just say, I'll have cognac on ice, you know, just he's presumed, you know, you got the money and just do it. But I filled it up with this and he said, oh, Jonathan, we always have the best your place. And he would have had the most terrible thumping head. He had about three glasses of his Aldi brandy. Oh, that's hilarious. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2174s) just started, I was finished. I'm just trying to think what else I have to talk about.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2181s)

Yeah, I got, I got some notes here. How you helped John Gadsden and David Hales, yeah, you spoke about that. Tell us about, you said you sent a cookbook to your wife, your ex-wife for her birthday.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2197s)

Yeah, well, I did on her birthday in May and I just haven't heard anything back from her. That's just, I've done a couple of emails to see whether she's got it. And because, I'm sitting there, both her and my son have blocked me on the phone. So I did an email to her just, and because like, I don't think she better block the email, I don't know, but I just haven't heard anything back. Yeah, it's just really hurtful. It is, you know what I mean?

**Lane Admiraal**

Yeah, talk about what kind of pressure you think, what kind of pressure [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2227s) they have put on her to turn her against you? 

**Jono Thomas**

Yeah, well, that thing is, they give her money, like that, pay, like she, she'll be looked after forever now if she stays in. And like, even when we left, in settling the house for example, I gave her all the money because I felt it wasn't her fault that I was gay. Like, she didn't know. And I felt, and I gave her everything, you know. So she's walked away with the whole investment of the house. And [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2258s), yeah, I don't know. Wow, it just, it's really, just really hurtful. But I've just got to keep going on, keep going.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2267s)

Yeah, you, you know, all you can do is hope that they saw maybe enough of the world that it'll just keep a little bit something in their mind that one day, you know, they'll realize that maybe this isn't the funnest place because it should be, right? Let's not forget that it should be the funnest, happiest, most loving place in the whole planet Earth, but it's Christian.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2293s)

Nah, not at all. Christian community church.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2300s)

It's bullies, like listen, the bullying and bullying and bullying that goes on, right? The hatred towards the LGBTQ, it's just disgusting.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2310s)

It really is, absolutely insane. I remember there was one, one of the, when there was two, two guys in Ballarat that once stuffed up together and it was this thing and they had this mark against them, like there was just this like stain. And they're both since got married to girls in there and had kids and they're still in, I think, but there's just always this mark against them because they were, were gay. It's just, yeah, the bullying is just, it's just insane.

**Lane Admiraal**

Where do you think the bullying culture starts? Where does it come from? I reckon it's from their, from their Bible and from Bruce, maybe. 

**Jono Thomas**

Yeah, I don't know. I've often thought it goes back to the foundation and the way the whole system is set up that that men are, you know, to worship one man. I mean, they're worshiping a man, they're not worshiping the Lord. And that power has, has gone out. And if you've got one man with so much power, he's just turned into a big bully.

And it [turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2389s) the whole system into a bunch of bullies. And the little kids see what's going on inside the meeting and they're just modeling the same behavior that they see inside the meeting. It all starts at the kitchen table with the talking. Yeah, because there was a bullying, Graham Seely from, he was, I'm not sure if he's still in Albury or not. He went around Australia doing a bullying seminar. Yeah.

And it started because of, we kicked up a real stink about my son Jake and the way he was bullied. Like we got a message to Bruce about it. And it was, so Graham Seely did a bullying seminar, went around Australia. And he, and he, that was his message, it all starts at the kitchen table. Yeah, like the parents do it, talk about it and do stuff. So yeah, and just because my son has autism and was just slightly different, he was just like this target. It was just, just insane.

And the only way they could rectify [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2458s) was him, like he would sit, he would sit separately at class time and change in the disabled toilet. It was the only way that would save him from, and one time, he was, there was like an outdoor play area that was covered over. One time he was locked, the kids locked him out there when they'd finished recess playtime. And because he couldn't get in, he smashed the glass to get into the classroom because no one was, you waited about 15 minutes. And then he got suspended for two days. Oh, unreal. Oh, crying out loud. Yeah, yeah. And like, I kicked up, I said, it's like, I understand Joe breaking the glass, but this is, it's not his fault. Like the kids, what about targeting, spending the kids at bullying?

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2508s)

Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about what you just said, about the, the bullying, like where does it come from? I think if you try and, you know, maybe look at it from an overhead view, you'll see that it comes from thinking that you are better than another person, right? Thinking that everything in the universe was created and the creator also decided that I'm going to be this super special thing, right?

It's like being [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2538s) the special zebra or something. For some reason, you were chosen and they're so special that they can just look down on other people. If you're not as high up as me in the church or God forbid, you're an outsider, you're scum, right? And it even pertains to their view of the environment. They don't really give a shit about earth because it's part of the world and it's all going to burn apparently in some hellfire, which I mean it will, but in a couple billion years by the sun. But this is, so that's where I think the bullying comes from, is from thinking that they are better, thinking that they are chosen and that they are, so they can just do what they want and pick on others because they're just not as holy as them.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2582s)

Yeah, that really, we're brought up to be superior to the outside world. Yeah, yeah, aren't we? And I remember when we first moved to Hamilton, on Sunday morning, used to go and fill up with fuel for to go to interchange. And I remember the lady at the petrol station, fuel station, gas station saying, she couldn't believe it because I came in in a white shirt and my navy trousers, the Brethren Sunday uniform.

And she said, I can't believe you're a brother, you're like, you're different, [you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2612s) friendly. What's, what's the go with you? The others are, everyone, everyone else is so up themselves and they don't even talk. But what's, what's happening? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They call themselves a mainstream Christian church, but it's so anti-Christian, the behavior. You know, oh, that we are special, we are chosen. And they refer to themselves as “the chosen ones.” They have a special life. 

**Lane Admiraal**

Well, I hate to tell [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2642s), there is 40,000 registered religions. And of that 40,000, probably all 40,000 preach to their members that they are the chosen one. So being part of the Brethren, you have a one in 40,000 percent chance of being the chosen ones. You know, it's, it's so silly. It really is.

**Jono Thomas**

Yeah, and sorry, just come to mind. So when we were, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2672s) eventually were confined in March 2020, and it was just when COVID kicked in and the government were doing good payments to help out. So Kerry and I both got, went to the government and got payments. And they put the house loan on hold. But then I applied for a job just as a cleaner at the hospital. Like, I just needed something. I couldn't, I wasn't going to sit around home because we've got no qualifications and no university.

So yeah. And then, and it was, it was [within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2702s) about four weeks, the CEO of the hospital, I'm gonna have, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a bit of a boast here. The CEO of the hospital said, you've got too good people skills, Jon, you shouldn't be, because I was also used to hand, hand out food to the patients as well and used to often help the old ladies with their salt and pepper and, you know, help them out instead of just dumping the tray and running.

And then as if you've got good, good people skills, can you go on the switchboard? So I did that, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2733s) that was really a good job. And then when I was on the switchboard, with my day two switchboard, that the Brethren found out where I was because one of the Brethren had come in for surgery. And then John Young, one of the priests, rang up while I was on my second day of training and tried hassling me, like saying, come back to the church.

And like, in the end, I might hand the phone over to the my trainer and she said, just fucking leave him alone. She just went absolutely ape about it. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2763s), anyway, that was, that was a really good, it was a good, really good experience. And then from then, the, the theater crew, because used to work like night shifts and stuff, the theater crew asked if I could come up and be a theater technician, like work in the theater with, you know, operating theater.

So, and I did that. And they, yeah, and I said, well, I've got no training. And they said, I will do it on the spot. We'll do training on site for you. And I did that, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2793s) it was amazing. So like, every surgery, I actually loved it. It was a good fun. Wow. Every time a baby was born, I would shed a tear. It was pretty, that was pretty freaky time when the baby comes out and cries, like, oh, it's a tear. But other than that, it was just like a lot done. It was just great, saving people's lives and helping them out.

Like, all right, so it was my job was to wheel the passenger, patient in and like keep them calm and help them put on [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2823s) bed and set up the theater and stuff. That was it. So it was a pretty good experience. So that's what I did before I got the job at Qantas. And then I like, I'm now in Melbourne. So. Wow. I'm starting to think you're Jack of all trades, master of them all.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2839s)

I was thinking that. Yeah. Good for you. What cool experiences, you know?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2847s)

100%. And the thing is, if we stayed in, my son, Jake, he would have just been given a job just being, you know, a floor sweeper because he's got autism, but, you know, packing boxes. And there's so much potential in these kids that leave, leave school year 12 and can't do anything with it. But they've just, you know, been handed a job and there's only limited options all that can do. Yeah, it's just insane.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2878s)

I think that business industry, like the business industry that the Brethren are, you know, the different industries that they're involved in, they, their highest dreams, some of these young people, you know, is just having a bigger one of those, right? They never dream really outside of their, their normal.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2897s)

No.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2899s)

But hopefully with, you know, with internet, hopefully that slowly changes. But now they control the internet, right? So, yeah, with streamline three, yeah, exactly, exactly. So tell us, tell us more about, you know, you're out and you are, are you dating now? You have a boyfriend now?

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2926s)

Yeah, I do.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2927s)

Okay, tell us how that happened.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2930s)

Um, oh, it's through one of the apps.

   
**Lane Admiraal**

Yeah, that's how I met my girlfriend friend, as you do.

**Jono Thomas**

 Yeah. And I just, so yeah, I just met up. I was actually, we went to the Mardi Gras in Sydney last year, not this year, long before. I would, I wouldn't go again. It's pretty, Mardi Gras is full of drugs and alcohol. It's a lot of unhappy people there. Yeah. But yeah, so that's how we, we went there together and from there on. But then we sort of went off, we were just friends. But now [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2967s) we're together now. So that's good. The thing is, but don't tell me off, I'm a cougar. I'm 46 and he's 22\.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2982s)

You are the cougar. I'm a cougar, yeah. Good for you. Good for you.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=2993s)

So if you can leave a message for people that feel like they're stuck inside there, what would you tell them about how to get out? Would you advise them to get out? 

**Jono Thomas**

Oh, absolutely. The freedom I've had now just to be able to be myself and live my truth and not fake. And that's the thing that hit me. I once had that, gave me this feeling all of a sudden, I realized that all I've done is just stop being fake.

I've brought all this persecution on me because I just, they don't want me to still keep faking. All I've just done is just being myself. And so that's what I would say to anyone, just like make the plunge. And I would, I'd easy help anyone to get out. Wow. And I'm sure there's, you know, that, I think Todd Coulter spoke the other day about that Anthony John who's going back and the Bruce Hales gave him 10 grand cash.

He once told me about, yeah, he's, he's seen several Brethren guys going to saunas and stuff. You know, guys right in Hales’s, right in the inner circle, 

**Lane Admiraal**

Literally, [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3068s)\! 

**Jono Thomas**

They're right, yeah. But there's definitely people, there's definitely more in there that are stuck. Gay men trapped inside the Plymouth Brethren, you mean? Yeah, that are gay. And I would just, the freedom is just insane. Like, I can just be me.

I don't, I don't go around, I love your cat, Carmen. I don't go around, yeah, what's her name? Pete. Pete, yeah. I don't go around, okay. I'm not, I don't go around pushing myself on, like, I'm not, you know, real, I hate the, see so gay stuff. Oh, yeah. I'm like, I'm not, I'm just, I'm just normal. Like, I don't, I don't even wish to pick something, most people don't even pick up where I am gay.

I remember when I was going through flight school, when I do my training, at the second last day, because we had a really good group of people that the trainers thought before our graduation that were a good group. So [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3139s) brought a cake and it was one of those colored rainbow cakes that was covered in white icing. And they went to cut it open and I said, oh, that's, that's just for faggots, like yuck, I'm not touching that, that's for poofs. And these girls said, oh, sorry, we thought you were gay all along. Oh, no, that's pretty funny. I don't, I don't force it on anyone. I'm just, I'm just me. Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3169s)

And for, and for the, you know, Brethren members in there listening that might be gay, there is no price you can put on freedom. I guarantee you, Jono will agree with me on that. There's no amount of money you can put on being able to make choices that you want to make without thinking that they're a sin or that they're bad or being worried about somebody finding out. You don't have to be, you know, when you're free, right? Everyone can find out and it's fine.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3199s)

Yeah, you don't have to look at your shoulder. And that was that, and that's why I used alcohol to cope. Like, I just couldn't live this double life. And especially with the, when the gay marriage law came out in Australia, I remember it was just like, was that was in like when I started really drinking alcohol, because outside world was accepting this culture and like, I couldn't do anything about it. I had to keep going, you know.

And [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3230s) why I started, it had really turned into alcohol. But I remember my daughter, because one of the teachers that, because as you know, the teachers are not Brethren or that they weren't, one of the kids were asked her, what do you think of the same-sex marriage law? And she said, yeah, well, I do because I've got neighbors that are same-sex and they're really lovely people and they're really kind.

So, and the kids really slammed her. So my daughter stood up [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3260s) she, she said, Dad, I used your middle finger pointing and said…I just yelled at them and said, what right have you got to say that to this teacher? Like, it's none of your business. And she really stood out. So we were quite outspoken people, so we probably brought on a lot of bullying ourselves. So, you know. Wow. Wow.

So you mentioned a minute ago, Anthony Charles... What was his name? John. Yeah. He's out and he's gay, right? Yeah. For our listeners, get into the weeds of that story. Like Bruce has paid him money just to come back, right? Had him to go to like a five-star motel in Noosa, like up, it's up western, no, yeah, up to the top of what, New South Wales, off, it's a real resort. And then also dropped around with him and Dean, they dropped around $10,000 cash in an envelope to his house. Wow, just to bribe him.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3328s)

$10 grand is like, that's such a small amount to like buy your life. I'm sorry, but that's a really small amount to like sell your, your beliefs for. I was hoping it would be like, maybe a million, five million, ten million.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3344s)

That's the thing for me, money, money doesn't, money's got nothing to do with the freedom that I have experienced now. Yeah, you can't put a price on it. I am, like, pay at Qantas, the pay is shit. Like, it's really bad. It's nothing at all. And you work really long hours. But I think it's going to be better with Air New Zealand. But it's just, yeah, it's just shit pay. But it doesn't matter. I'm just happy and free. And I'm living in a share house with other Qantas crew. And [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3375s) only $250 Australian dollars a week. So it's really cheap. So I'm happy. I'm getting through it. I'm just enjoying life. Wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3384s)

Yeah. That is life. That's great. That's living. I like that. Yeah, I know. And it's nothing. Yeah, money's nothing. No, it isn't. It isn't. Experiences, people, that's life.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3393s)

It's great when you have it. Like, in our family business, it was about a month or two before we left. I just got a brand new Q5 Audi, for example. Like, we were living the high life. Wow. Yeah, but it doesn't, I don't even care now. It doesn't matter. Nothing to do with it. But money is nothing. I've realized this. Money's just, doesn't buy freedom. Well, you can't take it with you, you know? No. Some of these people are spending their entire life, their entire focus, giving up everything to earn a dollar. They can't take it with them. I hate to tell you, but you cannot take that with you. And I live every day like it's my last.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3443s)

Yeah.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3444s)

Yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3445s)

That, I love that philosophy. That's awesome.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3449s)

Yes, big thumbs up. Yeah, yeah, I literally do. Like, I just, if I pass away tomorrow, well, at least I've had a good day today.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3457s)

Yeah, wow. See, that's the best way to live. I love that.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3462s)

I absolutely, and that's why, that's why I wanted to get on with this podcast fast, because I thought I might as well get it on and just get it done before I'm just, what if tomorrow I die? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3473s)

You never know. I hope not.

### **Carman Drever**

So, so before you close, if you could give your daughter one message, what would your message to her be? 

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3478s)

I'm really, really, really sorry for my harsh dad treatment and I would do anything that she wanted to make up for it. Yeah. Because, yeah, there's no two ways about it. I was a controlling, under the Hales influence, controlling dad. Yeah, and that's what I'd say.

Yeah, but then I bet the next part of that statement would be, stay where you are, I'll meet you there, we'll be happy. Yeah, and I'll do it. Like, I would, I would do anything for her. Like, if she wanted, yeah, to meet up or do anything, I just would. And I just, I just can't wait to hug her and cry with her. Yeah. Because, yeah, I just feel terrible.

Like the, I was reflecting on some of the experiences at John Gadsden with Bruce Hales. Remember one time, you remember Terry Markham? Yeah, Terry and Audrey. [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3554s). He once, they came for one of the meals because I think, I don't think he gave an address because it was like, they had a massive outdoor table and I'd often sometimes have up to 50 people to stay.

And I remember him, Bruce telling Terry, and Audrey was in like a pale green, like a nearly almost white dress and it was quite tight because you're quite petite, wasn't she? Yeah. And he stood [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3584s) up and said, and told her to stand up. And he, he told Terry, who do you think you are making your wife wear a white dress? Like that's just disgusting. And he really humiliated her. It was just, just awful, just awful. You've got no idea.

And then, and same with, and John Gadsden was just like a, he was just a fucking prick. I remember one time him telling me, when he was going out, like taking Bruce to the three-day meeting, because we stayed, because you help, the helpers stay home, they only go on Sunday. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3614s) I remember him walking past the dining room and said, oh, Jonathan, light bulb, because he was like real strict, like a Hitler. He said, Jonathan, light bulb, because it was a light bulb that had gone out above the dining room table.

And I was so pissed off with him and I said, well, I'm gonna have to stand up a new dining room table to change it. So they're so flash, like they're so rich and wealthy in that, and we were just downstairs in the basement on these stretcher beds and we're just servants. And I just, I'm fucking [over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3644s) it. I said, well, I have to stand up in dining room table, I'm gonna mark it, too bad.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3651s)

Oh man.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3652s)

Wow, wow.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3654s)

They're so stuck up.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3655s)

Yeah, oh, incredibly stuck up, terribly. Yeah, but anyway, I just would, just be an absolute joy if I could reconnect with my daughter. But I'm, I might, I'll, I think I'll have to wait probably till the restraining order's finished. And I think by then, like she'll be, she's 21 now, so she'll be 23\. And by then, the brain is starting to mature more, isn't it? Like 23, 24, 25\. Yeah. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3686s) I'm sure, is it right she's going through law school?

Yeah, yeah, she's at Melbourne Uni. Yeah. But, and she has to do with, I've connected with a guy from Perth who's just left literally a couple weeks ago. He was just, and he has to do with a guy called Amos McQuan. And she has to do with him, my daughter does. And because she's changed her name, she changed her name, first name and last name to, because [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3716s) thing is, I can understand if she was, because she told Kerry once, one phone call she had with her that if she's at a cafe and someone said, oh, for Jolinda, there's not many, her name is Jolinda, there's not many Jolindas in the world. And if there's any other Brethren there, they would soon pick up it's her. That's why she changed the name to really get out, you know.

So she could get on with her life. And I, I totally understand it. I totally, that's my thing, I'll take the regret, the [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3746s) harsh treatment. Hopefully she'll understand one day that I didn't know any different. Yeah, especially being under the Hales regime. And like we were, we were right in the inner circle. And there's so much pressure put on you to comply.

### [**Lane Admiraal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3763s)

No kidding. Wow. Well, thank you so much, Jono, for for sharing this all with us today, for coming on here. It's an incredible story. I really do hope your daughter hears this, because you know, I think it'll be an amazing reunion one day.

### [**Jono Thomas**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXnlXAkcMbQ&t=3779s)

I really do. Yeah. Yeah. I think so, yeah, too. Yeah. Thanks so much for having me on. Appreciate it. Thanks for all the time you guys put into this podcast. Oh, it's our pleasure. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. No, no, but you guys put hours into it. And it's just, yeah, it's just insane. I can't believe it.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
