## Summary

Daniel Mounter’s brothers and sister were unjustly torn taken from their gentle and unworldly parents and fostered out to other families for years, leading to most of them leaving the brethren. A family devastated and shattered by the cruel and bigoted Peterborough priests operating under the direction of Symington and Hales. Daniel remained in the PBCC as long as he could for his parent’s sake, before making a carefully planned exit to Canada. An inspiring and humorous story of escaping one of the grimmest localities in the UK to build a new life in Montreal.

### [**Announcer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=10s)

Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode of Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. Our guest for today is Daniel Mounter, who hails from Montreal, but before that he came from Peterborough in the UK, where he was a near neighbor of mine. And Daniel has a very interesting story to tell. So go ahead, Daniel, and introduce yourself and start into your story.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=37s)

Thanks, Richard. Thanks for the intro, and thanks for having me on this podcast too. I feel very privileged, given that my story isn't technically a typical one of somebody leaving the Exclusive Brethren, but it does, it does have a lot of resonance with the experiences a lot of you've experienced coming out of there. I'm 40 years old, originally from the United Kingdom and I was born in Peterborough in the UK, which is [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=67s) I'm a near neighbor of Richard's originally. 

And basically I was born into the Exclusive Brethren at a time when there was no option to join them or to declare if you wanted to break bread. It was assumed that you were going to be a member from birth. So I had a fairly typical introduction of being baptized and then it was assumed that I would follow the pathway the same as my siblings did. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=97s) I was the youngest of six children. My parents originally hailed from Surrey in the south of England and they moved up to firstly to Huntingdon in the east of UK and then on to Peterborough related to my dad's work there. My brothers and sister were all born in Huntingdon. I was the only one born in Peterborough. My dad had joined that locality. I have to [pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=127s) back for some of these dates because my dad actually wrote a timeline for me before I left the Brethren, which has proved very useful reaching back and working out when these splits and family divides happened. And so my dad, in 1971, he moved with a family to Peterborough. And that was related to being told he had to stop his civil service job. At the time, the Brethren were told that you had to [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=158s) in buying and selling, and you couldn't hold a civil service job because of the National Secrets Act.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=163s)

Yeah, I remember that. Yes. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=165s)

Yeah, basically the idea was if you had to be obliged by your work to sign the National Secrets Act, then you couldn't snitch on any fellow brethren. So if you saw a feed in the course of your work doing something they shouldn't have been doing, then you would not be able to because of the National Secrets Act. That was the... Wow. Yeah. He followed the work to Peterborough and he was based there. Um, it wasn't long before the [proverbial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=195s) hit the fan actually in our family. In 1979, my second oldest brother, uh, who was 13 at the time, he refused to, uh, take part in the breaking of bread because he was present, um, with an elder who he'd found pornography in this elder's drawer. And he said he didn't want to eat from the same loaf or drink from the same cup as a pervert. Anyway, long story short, the whole family was suspended and this was in late 1979\. So I was only about 18 months old. The whole family was put under confinement because of my 13-year-old brother's rebellion, if you like.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=242s)

Yeah, actually doing what the Brethren said you should do and withdrawing for iniquity but...

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=248s)

Yeah, but a bit out of our face, right? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh, that state continued for almost a couple of years before they started dealing with it. And we had the infrequent visits, priestly visits we called them. Um, then it was decided that because my brother was unrepentant, my three other brothers and my sister would be farmed out to other peeb families and, um, [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=278s) sister and another brother went to one local peeb family where there's, there's quite a history with them. Um, Deanna Mason is one that would know more about that because she was, uh, she was on the inside at the time. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, I remember...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=294s)

Your sister being at the Masons.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=297s)

Yeah, that's right. Yeah, she stayed there until she married. She never came home, even when we were allowed to come back to the meetings. Yeah. So progressively what happened was my brothers, three of them left home to stay with other peebs. My sister left. And when as soon as my brother Mark was deemed old enough to leave home, which was 15 in his case, he was kicked out the house along with his pregnant girlfriend who was a non-Brethren. Yeah. And they basically lived on the streets for a while. Um, once he was firmly out of the house, we were actually released back into the peebs. Um, and that, that period was, um, yeah, it was actually five years long. It was 1984 before we were allowed to rejoin the peebs. So I, this is why I say I'm kind of privileged and I missed out on a very formative period in indoctrination.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=357s)

Yes, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=358s)

It doesn't make me special in a way, but at the same time, during all that time we were excommunicated, my parents were following all the principles of the peebs. They were singing hymns at the table. They were praying, giving thanks for the food, reading the Bible daily, and unable to make friends amongst non-Brethren. They were constantly under stress for support. There was nobody, no [social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=389s) workers, nothing. Just the priestly visits every six months or so to ask if my father had purified the house and we could rejoin the peebs. So, uh, that dragged on a fair while.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=403s)

Yeah, well, that's sadly typical, isn't it though? I mean so many families have had that experience. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=410s)

Absolutely, yeah. And, um, my family, my own family's experience was far from unique in Peterborough. Yeah, there was perhaps, uh, 20, 20-something in my brother's generation who left from the late 70s to the mid-80s. Yeah. And, um, as a result of that, the peebs kind of, I don't know if they gave me a bit more rope, but they certainly, they certainly pulled back from being as extreme as they were with my brothers.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=444s)

Yeah, there was a bit of a, there was a kind of a regime change in Peterborough, I think around that time and, um, yeah, a few people got their wrists slapped. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=459s)

No, that's absolutely true. And, uh, in fact, what apparently what Symington said was that the peebs in Peterborough especially, um, like the elders were getting at one another too much and that's how the, the heavy, the, uh, the elder who had the pornography in his drawer, he was let off after only two weeks of being shut up without apologizing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=484s)

And you stuck out for three years for pointing out the fact. Yes.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=488s)

Yeah. Wow. That was quite a period in the history of that city and Cambridge too.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=495s)

Yes.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=496s)

There's quite a few of your generation, I think, my brother's generation would relate to that. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=503s)

Definitely. Definitely. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=504s)

Yeah. So that, that was kind of a weird, a weird start in life for me, especially coming to the meetings at like, around seven or eight years of age and never having remembered a meeting before that. And I was, I was so puzzled by a lot of stuff, like why, why the girls were wearing these little pieces of cloth on their heads and various things like that. And I didn't really buy their explanations. I mean, I don't know if it's because of being isolated from the peebs that I didn't understand, but I felt like I fitted in there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=544s)

Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=547s)

I don't know if that's typical of other people who've grown up like indoctrinated from day one or...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=553s)

No, it may well be, as you say, because in that kind of very formative period of your life you were protected from the kind of intensive indoctrination of meetings every day. Yeah, maybe that's why you had a broader mind and you know, didn't just accept it as being normal. I mean something, something that you see every day right as far back as you can remember you just assume that to be [normality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=584s). You don't question, exactly. Yeah. A fish doesn't question what water is, it just swims in it.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=588s)

Yeah, yeah, that's a really good analogy. I am, I never, never really thought about it that way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=594s)

Being a fishing man yourself.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=595s)

Yeah, well I mean a fish until they're pulled out by the nose, they don't really know what's, uh, what's up. Yes, yeah. But when, um, when we were withdrawn from, especially for that first period, because there was another period when, um, because my brothers, obviously, during those five years they'd missed out on a lot of my dad's input. They hadn't really had a father at that time and they were going along with the flow trying to fit in with everyone else. And they were doing things that most of their age group was, like going to pubs or like hanging out doing worldly stuff. Yeah. 

And, yeah, they didn't have their father at home to kind of steer them. So they tended to get scapegoated for that a lot. Yeah, yeah. They were kind of like the problem, the problem kids. So they were shut up fairly soon after we were released back into the peebs. So we went through another three years of no meetings, which I was super thankful for afterwards.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=657s)

Yeah. It was probably in that period, I'm not quite sure. I mean, I remember going to, um, what's the Fryer called? Is it Roger Fryer? 

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=670s)

It was, yeah, yeah. My two...brothers, um, Dave and Tim were there. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=672s)

Yeah, yeah, that's right. I remember we went with my parents, you know, going to their house when I was a child and your two brothers were there and there were some hijinks going on and yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=682s)

Yeah, yeah, well the, uh, that was the, that was the difference. Like my brothers, they did come home for a brief period. Like I said, my sister never came home from the other, the other household where she was staying until she, and when she married, we were still, we were shut up again for the second time. So we didn't, we didn't get to her wedding. My mother never saw her only daughter married, which is something I find completely unforgivable. Yeah. Um, the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=712s) I remember when they broke the news because the, the guy she was engaged to, a big guy, um, he got in a very serious car accident while they were engaged. Yeah. And, um, it completely changed everything. His personality changed and he wasn't the person my sister fell in love with. Wow. But she was told that she must go ahead with it regardless and like put up with whatever sequel it came from his accident, which, uh, was pretty serious. He was mangled completely.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=743s)

Yeah, yeah, I remember hearing about it at the time. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=747s)

But we, we knew nothing of this until the priest turned up on our door and said, "Oh, your daughter's married, uh, her fiance and now her husband was in a serious accident and, uh, this is the details." And we're like, nice. Yeah, the most of my experience of those, those two periods of being shut up was, um, my parents would never let me in the room when the heavies were there, the priests, but I can never forget how my mom would cry after and before those visits. And just something in me said like, "If these people are godly people, what can they be saying or doing that's literally driving my mother insane?" 

Because she, she had a very sad history too. And she had three younger brothers and when her father passed away, she was almost kind of like a secondary mother because her mother had to go to work. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=804s) those, those three younger brothers, they started rebelling against the peebs. This was way back in the 50s. And, um, she saw, she lost them, so to speak. And then she was losing again four more boys to the, to the outside world as they put it to her. Yes, it made her lose her reason. She was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic for several years and then finally treated for bipolar and that helped [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=834s) lot. But I can never forget the, uh, just like the feeling of dread when the priest came to our house. Because it was like they brought a dark cloud with them every time, man.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=845s)

Yeah. I mean, I remember your parents well, and I mean, they were the most unworldly people. I mean, compare them to what brethren are like today. I mean, they lived in, we're not quite poverty, but extremely simply and they were very simple Christians. Um, most inoffensive people.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=862s)

Yeah, and, um, I think the, the thing that I singled out in Peterborough especially that kind of where my dad didn't fit the mold and where another family didn't fit the mold was they were both university educated. Uh, my dad had a doctorate. Yeah, and this other peeb woman, um, she had a degree. She was, had a master's in teaching. And there was kind of this distrust of anyone who'd been to university. Like their every word that came out of their mouth, you couldn't trust. 

Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like an inferiority complex on the part of the other, the local peeb. The only, the only thing I can liken it to is, um, how, um, Adolf Hitler actually in the beginning of the war, he was very, um, anti-academic. He was like all about the open-air learning, uh, like the Boy Scouts and everything. But yes, yeah. Academia was kind of, uh, yeah, it's a waste of time and yeah, you should be working on your fitness and breeding little, uh, little Germans. Yeah. That was the kind of analogy. Instead, you should be breeding little peebs and not going to university.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=942s)

Yeah, no, it was, it was very like that. Of course, coming from Cambridge, the university city where, you know, my father was a graduate, we just got constant flack. I mean, you know, if you came from Cambridge, regardless of whether you had anything to do with the university or not, you were treated with ridicule by brethren from other localities. And as my family was very much, you know, my father, my grandfather were both university, you know, I think my grandfather was a professor, my father was a doctor of physics.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=972s)

We...We got endless, endless flack all the time. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=977s)

And yeah, that's exactly what was going on subsurface with my father. I felt he was a very simple guy. I mean, in terms of a peeb, he wasn't, he wasn't much because he'd take a whole year to get through a bottle of scotch, for example. The bottle of Grant's, like, uh, when I was old enough, that started to get paler and paler, but it never went down.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1003s)

That's pretty sad that that's how we gauge on her. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1011s)

But it was, um, it was like almost, uh, when they asked him to preach, for example, there was almost a level of embarrassment that this guy should be asked to preach. And he, he had a very weird style as well. Like when you didn't fit the typical peeb mold, he would be always like you're telling a story and you always have to make a story out of the moral, you know. Yeah. But, um, yeah, that, uh, those early days were, um, I think in all fairness, they actually gave me more of a chance because I went to a mainstream school. I'm really thankful if anything else, I didn't go to a peeb school until the sixth form, which is actually in your father's premises, Richard. Yeah, I remember seeing you there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1058s)

Yeah, kind of like a pilot project for the peeb school.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1061s)

Yeah. But the mainstream education helped a lot, but it also kind of emphasized that I didn't belong there. And at the same time, I didn't feel like I belonged to the peebs. It was a constant struggle trying to fit in, in either of those worlds and not being able to do either.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1082s)

You're in limbo. Yeah. You're stuck between two worlds.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1086s)

Yeah, yeah. And maybe because my parents are more tolerant or they bore in mind what, uh, what John Hales has said, uh, "You've got to retain that boy at all costs," as in referring to me. He said, "You've got to hang on to him for the truth." Um, because all your other, your other sons are gone. And, um, maybe because of that, my parents turned a blind eye to stuff, but it's not a good feeling when you're going on with all this, uh, stuff that is legit in the world's eyes, but it's, it's a deep sin if you're, uh, if you're trying to be a good peeb. Just, uh, things like recorded music or, uh, keeping, uh, keeping literature from all the classics, not just the approved ones.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1136s)

Yeah, that was the second end of the wage they used to, yeah. Classics is a broad term, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1144s)

And I can never believe that. And my dad, he vetted my bookshelves and he would, um, he'd throw away the H.G. Wells, but he never, um, he never pulled out the book, uh, called "Tales of a Woman of Pleasure," uh, Fanny Hill. "Oh, that's a good one." Yeah, that's an erotic novel in there. He never, never noticed that one. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, there's a lot of inconsistencies in, uh, in my experience compared to a lot of people's experiences. But, um, like fast forwarding a little bit, because I don't want to go through my, my family history where it's not really, not really relevant to the cultic experiences. Um, I think the next kind of big event when our family could have got back together was in the, uh, the famous review of 2002\. I'm sure all of you've, you've all [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1202s) relative experience to that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1203s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1205s)

Yeah. It's, uh, that for me was kind of a turning point when I started to see it much more from an outside point of view than trying to fit into it. And because we were allowed to approach my four brothers, they're all allowed to come to my parents' house except for the first one who left because he was kind of a loose cannon and they wanted him to meet us in a safe space. So they got him and a recently recruited guy from, from Essex who'd been brought back in after, I don't know, maybe like 40 years outside and who'd been treated like shit by the Brethren. They brought him back in and...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1254s)

They... Not Mr. Smith by any chance?

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1257s)

It was, isn't it? He was a Giles.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1261s)

Oh, okay. Yeah, no, never, I don't think I met him. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1265s)

Yeah, but he was okay. Yeah, he was kicked out and his wife was, she stayed in. Yeah, cut him off from all the bank accounts in one day, just in one fell swoop. So his experience was kind of relatable for my brother. Right, right. Yeah, yeah. That, uh, I can never forget that meeting when my brother walked into, um, into the house and he, he said to the host, like, uh, "Why do you have an Australian accent? You're from Peterborough same as me. Why are you talking like an Australian?" And then he didn't know what to say. He's like, he was like so nimbly sidestepping all these questions. Like they were saying, "Are you, are you interested in returning to the brethren" He's, "No, F that."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1319s)

They thought they were handing him this wonderful privilege. You know, he should get down on his knees and beg for it.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1325s)

Well, yeah. And then he brought up at the time, he said, "Look, um, you're asking me if I'm repentant now when I begged and I begged and I begged, I wrote letter after letter to my mother and father begging me to, to bring me back in fellowship, um, to bring my then girlfriend with the baby boy, the lady to the baby girl back in fellowship because I couldn't care for them properly. I was only a teenager then, of course." 

And then [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1356s) same surfaced with my other three brothers. And when we were allowed to, it sounds horrible to say it, allowed to talk to them again, like we re-established contact with them and met with them in other peeb houses for the first time. And of course, they were all over that. They, they thought they'd never see my parents alive again to be able to speak to them. So they, they jumped at that. And then maybe six months later, the people were like, "Well, are they showing any signs of repentance of turning to the fold?" And we were like, "Not really, no. They've made lives for themselves and their repentance was ignored." 

Well, beginning in 2003, we were told, "No, we're going to have to, you're going to have to back off from talking to them again." And that was a point when I got myself a mobile phone and I found the numbers, my brother's mobile numbers. And whenever I felt really kind of distant from the peebs, I would call them or text them on a hidden mobile. Mm-hmm. And kind of from that point when, uh, when they started bringing in all the with the Wordex computers and...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1436s)

All three, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1439s)

Yeah, all of that stuff started to come in. I, it just shifted so much away from what I thought was a church. Yes, yeah. Yeah, I couldn't believe my parents were still sticking with it after all their commitment through those eight years when they were, they were forced to worship alone. They were completely without support and yet they were loyal to what they thought was, uh, the truth. I just couldn't believe that they were buying all this with, uh, you know, you've got to buy your, your groceries from Waitrose because Tesco doesn't accept the school vouchers and...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1475s)

Yes, it was high pressure sales. I mean, every day there was someone in the parking lot handing out leaflets or persuading you to, "You must buy this or buy that." It was, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1486s)

And they got, um, they got everyone in this kind of like energy depleting state. So like any spare energy you had after going to a meeting every night and four times on a Sunday was completely spent. Yeah, that's energy you could have used for thinking outside the box or...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1506s)

Yeah. Yeah, fundraising activities and all that stuff. Yeah, or...

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1510s)

being creative. So my brothers were kind of cautious about keeping contact with me. They were like, "Oh, don't get yourself in trouble. Don't upset mom and dad." So I was kind of living with mom and dad at the time, into my 20s. And, uh, I was kind of treading on eggshells all the time, trying not to, uh, to get my parents thrown out, but at the same time, having to put on this bullshit facade every day to go to the meetings was just too much.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1547s)

Yeah, it's really, really hard to do. It's very, very difficult to keep it up. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1552s)

Yeah, yeah. And I think that, that, uh, that whole review business, uh, was really like a tipping point because it showed me unequivocally what, what it really was about. And it was just an unashamed attempt to re-recruit people. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I know a lot of Brethren jumped on it because, well, wouldn't you if your family, uh, had been banned from contacting you, wanted to contact them finally after 30 years? Yeah, [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1582s) wouldn't jump at that. It's natural, right? And then, um, then to be told, "Oh, no, you've got to back off because, uh, it's, it just doesn't make sense. It doesn't come..."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1593s)

No, I mean, the irony is it was the Brethren who needed to be doing the repenting, not the people that they had unfairly kicked out.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1601s)

Exactly, yeah. And in the case of my youngest older brother, they said, "We wrongly withdrew from him," because his, his gross errors were in being seen smoking once and being seen with my other two brothers at a pub once. And he was actually withdrawn from for that, not just shut up. So, uh, they, they publicly reviewed this judgment in the church meeting and then [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1631s) told Bob Fryer, which is, uh, yeah, about the same age, yeah. They told him that he had to convey the responsibility to my brother. So he said, "You know, on behalf of the Brethren, I'm apologizing to you for a decision that was made." And my brother said, "What are you talking about? You were doing the same shit."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1658s)

I was going to say, I was just about, I knew that was going.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1662s)

Yeah, but you thought it was so funny as Bob Fryer's kids were there and his wife. Yeah. Yeah. So he's like, "Why are you personally responsible? Explain to me what you mean by taking on responsibility for..." Yes. He said it was the same two people that were sitting there like the, you know, dumb and dumber.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1687s)

Which kind of brings out another point, that the severity of the way our sin was dealt within the Brethren depended far more on what your last name was than on what you actually did. I mean, Bob Fryer was a Fryer. So that was one thing, but a Mounter doing the same thing. That's a much, much darker and more satanic thing, isn't it?

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1708s)

Yeah, and proportionally how much it touched the peeb coffers, like it wasn't... Oh, yes. Yes. My, I mean, my dad literally was a nobody and that directly affected how they perceived the actions of his sons. I mean, the only reason I was fortunate was because there was a lot of peebs who really objected to my brothers being kicked out. And some of them suffered losing their children as well like that. So they were determined to kind of put in the same control in place. But at the same time, during 2003, when they started doing the U-turns over the review, that was really when...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1758s)

It turned into a roundabout, didn't it? Rather than a U-turn. But yeah, pretty much.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1764s)

They almost burned the tires out. Yeah, that started me kind of on a path, um, towards, uh, eventually leaving, leaving the pigs. And, uh, from that point, I started, um, just skipping meetings until I actually had a reputation for the best skiver from the meetings in the UK. Yeah, yeah, last marks for attendance. Yeah, it was a, it was a good, uh, it was a good time. They actually had an attendance officer at one point.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1797s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1799s)

It's his job to call and say, "We're very concerned, uh..."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1804s)

Yeah, he had you on speed dial, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1807s)

I couldn't very well say, "Well, uh, actually, I had a couple of really nice DVDs I wanted to watch, so I stayed home." So it was just, uh, so much, so much, uh, of a double life by 2007\. And that I'd stopped going to meetings altogether by that time. But, um, another, another instance that really kind of formed my mind and that was when Bruce Hales visited Peterborough in, uh, in 2006\. They had this big exercise in Peterborough to move out to places in the area which were less Islamic. Yes, yes, there was a very high proportion of Muslims in Peterborough and a lot more immigrants arriving every day. And they determined like in a few meetings that we should split into Swaffham and Stamford. But they did a lot of this without consulting Bruce Hales. It started out in the early 2000s. And then in 2006, when pretty much half the meeting had moved to either Swaffham or Stamford, he finally came to take meetings in Peterborough. 

And when he rolled up, I mean, it was just out of this world. They had a big security convoy for him, private security. We spent 25,000 pounds [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1894s) just on security measures for that meeting. And he had like a plan B, C, and D to exit the meeting room. They had this little microphone stand that had been converted into a drink stand so he could have his bottle of Evian or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And then after, they knew I was wanting to get married at that time. So they're like, "You know, it's the best chance to speak to Bruce Hales because you've got to ask permission to marry a peeb girl." So I hopped in the car of one of the other heavies that was heading to the house. And, uh, they were driving like breakneck speed through Peterborough, so they want to get killed or something. 

Anyway, when I got there, I had, uh, I had like a 20-minute audience with him because nobody else was, uh, was coming in. Yeah. And it's just the, the physical impressions I have from that time. Like he was sitting there sipping on his scotch and he was, um, he was pretty much dismissing everything I said. Yeah. Like I said, "I'm, uh, I'm exercised to, uh, to get married. There's a young sister I'm very interested in, blah, blah, blah, blah." And he was like, "Can you mow the lawn? And do you leave the towel on the floor in the bathroom? And, uh, are you good with, are you good with finances?"

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1982s)

He probably thought he was hiring, he's probably in some kind of fantasy world. He was thinking he was hiring a household servant for his mansion back in Sydney or something.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1991s)

Yeah, wrong interview.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1993s)

Wrong interview, Bruce. Change the tape.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=1996s)

Anyway, he literally gave me like 10 things, uh, just this, um, self-help book style, um, stuff like, "Oh, make sure you mow the lawn, pay your bills on time, get her to do her share of the, like the bookkeeping and stuff like that if you're not good with it." And, um, then the other peebs started coming in, of course, and posing their questions about, "Oh, we, uh, we've already started moving to Stamford, but, um, we have this problem, this problem, this problem. This peeb can't [sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2026s) his house." He was like, "Why did you start all this? Why is Stamford a good place? Is it, is it somewhere there was a meeting before? And Swaffham, there's never been a meeting there, right?" Half of us already moved there.

 So he was like, "Well, we better go. We better go check it out and see these two places." Anyway, coming home from that meeting with him, because it was a fellowship meeting and my parents who were living in my house at that time, we moved out of their house. I bought a house in Stamford and they came along with me because you're not allowed to be single in-house. Yeah. Um, they're already entertaining a whole couple of families. Uh, and I just, uh, struggled to absorb all this, all this crap from him. Yes. What really took me over the edge was he kept me on, uh, he kept me on a string for almost a year. Yeah, until 2007, I could never get an answer. I had to fax Stephen Hales and ask his other brother to give me an answer about my marriage. And my fiance got cold feet too. So she was like, "No, this is, this is not going to work out. I have a really bad feeling." 

And luckily, she pulled the plug on it. So I was free from that. And that point onwards, I stopped attending the meetings altogether. Yeah. And managed to go online finally. Yeah. It was, uh, something suggested by my GP, actually, because he knew a lot of family history, how we've been split apart and my brothers are gonna drift kind of. Yeah, yeah. He said, "You have to go to the library. Just, uh, learn to surf the net safely and don't get like entrapped in anything. And, uh, check out, check out other religions, check out other, uh, other cultures and broaden your mind." Yeah, wow. Yeah. So I started, um, I started penpaling a lot of people, no peebs at all. I found, and I actually met my now ex-wife on the website. Yeah, yeah. That's basically what brings me to Canada.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2161s)

Yeah. Long story short. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Wow. I mean, that's to the credit of your GP. I mean, that was some very good advice. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2172s)

He really, he really kind of had our family and the Brethren sussed in that sense because he was, he dealt with my mother when she had her problems or psychological problems and he, he saw like firsthand the, um, the impact on our family. And he said, "Your family's going to tell you I'm going to hell for telling you this. You need to broaden your mind. Go on the internet." Um, he said, "There's ways to do it safely. You won't be entrapped in anything. Just learn how to create an email account and start messaging people."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2209s)

I mean, this is why the Brethren are now so controlling about who you go to see for psychiatric help or anything like that. You know, you can't just go to anyone. They have this network of pre-approved people who have promised not to do anything that will take you away from the Brethren. I mean, you had some experience with that, didn't you, at one point?

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2231s)

I have. I've had, um, yeah, well, I had two experiences with it. Um, I saw a psychiatrist in Northampton who was an approved one, like a favor approval. And he saw some people who had some real serious issues and kind of steered them away from suicide. Yeah, my then employer suggested I go to him because I was missing quite a lot of work through depression and problems with alcohol too. I went to see this guy and the first consultation was okay. He just basically gave me an intro.

 And then for the second consultation, my employer was like, this is Turners of King's Lynn. Yeah. They said, "One of us has got to go with you to your next appointment." I said, "Why? What?" "Oh, just to make sure you were given the support you need." Yes. Yeah. So I didn't tell them when my next appointment was. I went to it. And when afterwards they got the bill, they were like, "This is ridiculous. It's a complete waste of time to see him without any of us." "Well, he's actually very helpful. He was sympathetic." He said the people culture is very focused on alcohol and, uh, it's very, uh, it's very, um, conducive to the problems with it because you guys have a tendency to bury stuff. 

Yes, anyway, not long, uh, not long before I emigrated here, I had to get a, um, like a sign off to say that I was mentally okay to move here. Yeah, immigration process. And I requested this psychiatrist write me a brief letter. And when I spoke to the Northampton hospital, they said he's been struck off. Interesting. He was kind of like the top people. I see.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2350s)

Yeah, there's a whole story. There's a whole pile of dirt to come out about the way the Brethren abuse not not only the, you know, psychiatric profession, but the way they abuse medications, you know, mind-altering drugs. Yeah, it's, it's a shocking history. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2368s)

Especially in regard to homosexuality and trying to make it, um, I know Craig's stories, but it's, uh, it's far from the only one, I'm sure.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2377s)

Yes, no, that's true.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2379s)

Yeah. I think that was, uh, that was what my employer's beef was. This, this psychologist or psychiatrist, he didn't prescribe me anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2387s)

Right, right. They wanted something to like dumb you down and make you more amenable to being, yeah, um, yeah, pushed around. Yeah, exactly that.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2397s)

Just make you more compliant, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They decided my, my mental trouble was, uh, that I was rebellious or, uh, unconventional, I don't know. But anyway, that was that one. And then more recently, like when I was working here for Qatar Airways, my benefits included like counseling therapy. So I wanted to do that and try and unpack a little bit all the baggage that I felt into Canada with me. Yeah. And she came up with something really good. She said, "You need to relabel the Brethren in your mind and in your correspondence in every, every way." She's like, "When you say 'the Brethren,' it, it triggers something in you." So I, I came up with the EB system.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2449s)

Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2450s)

They're always talking about the world system and, uh...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2453s)

Yes.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2454s)

Anything systematized, it's the EB system, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2457s)

Really good point that is. I really like that.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2461s)

Yeah, you know, for me it's a breakthrough moment, um, being able to re, like relabel them because they, they tried to relabel themselves. We know that they didn't change jack, but...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2472s)

Yeah, no, if anything, their new label got them worse. They're in a worse state than they were when they were Exclusive Brethren.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2478s)

Right. Yeah, because they're hiding behind the label now. Um, but no, it's, it's something that I think it would really help anyone who, who's still struggling with a lot of the, the baggage of coming out of a cult, not just the, the Exclusive Brethren, but some of the other cult-like religions and organizations, uh, is learning to re, uh, to relabel them. Wow. Yeah, it's kind of a poke in the eye to them as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2506s)

Yeah, I like that. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2510s)

Call them a system. Uh, well, it is a system, right?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2513s)

Because it is a system. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2514s)

And it's a commercial system now by all, by all the, uh, indicators.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2519s)

Oh, very much so. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2522s)

I mean, um, my relation to the peebs now is pretty much my parents are alive. They're still, they're still, uh, de facto members because they're in a home. They don't have many chances to go to meetings. My sister's firmly in there. My nephews and niece, I can't speak to them. They're completely off the, off the board. And I have four brothers who are all living with the same kind of damage, if not worse than I'd had. And they didn't have anything that I had when I left. Like when I decided finally to quit the peebs and make a decision to do an act, which was to marry an outsider as a way of completely cutting off. And my brothers are all there to help me. They chipped in with advice and financial help, everything. Um, but they and most of their generation didn't have any of that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2584s)

No, no. I mean, they were chucked out as teenagers and left on the street. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2590s)

When I find that not only is that protect, that maybe it's like, uh, unforgivable, but it's also, um, something that the local leaders at any rate never, never publicly apologize for.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2604s)

It's inhumane. This just sounds like we're sitting here talking about Maple Creek. I can't believe I was...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2609s)

Thinking the same.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2610s)

Thing. Literally feels like we're talking about Maple Creek. And I think it's important for the listeners and viewers to understand that this is, this is the other side of the world and how important it is that they have this systematic, um, response to things the same way, the same way, the same way, the same way. We have this, there's just things that have kind of really popped open for me. We've talked about them before, but even more so since you've told your story. And it's like how they talked about how they kept you in limbo, how [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2640s) didn't feel like you fit in here and you didn't feel like you fit in here. And I thought, what a perfect way for a leader to have complete submission from its followers by putting them into situations like their school, like these certain things. It makes you feel like you're not accepted or in something. So what do you do? You look for that place to be accepted. And what do they do? They look up, right? They're looking to the leader. And so they just grovel at, "Okay, well here's a leader who says he, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2671s) is the, you know, embodiment of Christ at this point in time." And I think it's funny that you sat down with him and you didn't have no epiphany of sitting down and hearing Christ.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2680s)

I was blown away, but not in that sense. Yeah, right. Yeah. They say never meet your heroes, don't they?

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2692s)

Well, there's two big flaws actually from that occasion. And they were the things that apart from the whiskey, which really stuck out. One was I had a pair of really expensive Brasher hiking boots that I bought at cost price, and I paid about 200 pounds. This is back in 2003 for these. I used to wear them to the meetings and the people didn't like that very much because they weren't like formal shoes, but they were super comfortable. He took one look at them and he goes, "You [might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2722s) want to get yourself some real shoes." And he said, um, "Shoes like those from Tesco's, uh, Tesco's is going out of business, uh, within two years because they, they don't support our voucher scheme and they're importing all this Chinese junk." I'm sitting there in my, uh...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2747s)

That's hilarious. I can remember that. I remember Tesco's being spoken of very badly because they didn't support the Brethren's voucher scheme. And probably it was that remark that was behind it. And they haven't gone out of business as far as I know, have they? No.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2759s)

And then the other thing was when he was giving all his like his 10 things to do to make you a good husband, uh, one of his things was like, um, "You share your finances with a wife. I always share with Jenny my finances, except a few investments." And he goes like, wink, wink, wink. She was in the room at the time. She didn't say a word. She didn't blink. And I was like, this is supposed to be like a transparent, pure man. Uh, yeah, right, this...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2793s)

This is supposed to be you meeting the man of God, the elect vessel for some advice about the biggest decision of your life, right? And you get asked if you hang your towels up.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2807s)

Like a fascinating stuff that I could have got from a self-help book, which I'd already read by that time. I don't need the man of God to tell me that you shouldn't leave wet towels on the bathroom floor. It's unreal. But it's like you said, Cheryl, though, and just going back to that, I don't understand why they deny there's this universal requirement, this universal standard, because they used to preach about it every single meeting.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2844s)

Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, they claim every place is autonomous. I mean, the reason they claim it is that it means that if something gets really badly screwed up in one place, it doesn't reflect on Bruce Hales. That's the reason for the claim. But yeah, exactly. It's plausible deniability, right? Yeah, exactly. Plausible deniability. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2863s)

The same thing comes back to a household level as well. I know for a fact that a lot of the apologies that were never delivered to my family were because, "Well, it's a household thing. It's not really the, it's not the body of the Brethren that decided this. It's maybe a couple of heavies who had too much whiskey and went on a power trip." Or it's maybe, yeah...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2887s)

I mean, basically the blame always gets passed downwards and the credit always gets passed upwards, doesn't it? That's how the system works. It follows the money up.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2896s)

Yeah, yeah. And that, that's what makes me sick to my stomach to see, uh, Hales and company become this, this vast corporation now with all this money and, uh, yeah, you've got the rank and file peebs like my parents, just as an example, uh, happily coughing up all their money, their life savings, their, uh, their property when they pass away is gonna, I'm pretty sure it's going to be [given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2927s) to the peebs.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2927s)

Yes, yeah, yeah. Oh, they're very into getting into people's wills. You know, when you're on the deathbed, they don't come around to give you the last rites. They come around to make sure all your money is being signed over to Bruce Hales. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2940s)

And that's, that's a very typical, uh, cultish behavior too, um, regardless of the, the type, like even non-religious culture. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2953s)

So we, we received an email from an insider here just a couple days ago that I just want to, when we're talking about the financial part of things, and I'm just going to read just one paragraph at the very end. This is how he or she ends it. It's anonymous, so we don't know who it is. And they say, "I feel like what might have been original intentions of following a sort of simple Christianity went out the window a long time ago in this group. It basically seems like a campaign to secure and maintain revenue streams at this point." [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=2984s), yeah. And there's needed in there, there, I mean, we've had so many responses lately of people just seeing right through the whole thing. The key is, is how do you, how do you now turn around and, um, make the changes that need to be made, whether it's in there or you leave, right? Um...

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3007s)

It's, it's very problematic.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3010s)

Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3011s)

I mean, the desirable outcome is a complete implosion of the whole, the whole setup, the whole system. But at the same time, that's going to leave so many people high and dry who've invested their entire lives and their families and their means in this system since day one. Um, they just don't know what the alternative is. And that's no, it's the problem. What alternative is offerable to these people? Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3038s)

And I mean, I don't think there's a way to do this without it becoming messy. I don't think there's a way to do this without it becoming chaotic, right? Unfortunately, there's kind people and very, um, Christian-like people still in there that are going to get caught in the riptide of it all. The thing is, is what do you do? Do you sit back here and do we just let it continue the way it continues? Right? Like it's like to me, and I mean as the, from this response we're getting, it's the more we sit back and do nothing is the more powerful they're getting. Right? Yeah. To me, I would rather see a mess and chaos. I think humans respond very well in chaos. I think we're built to respond in chaotic and messy situations. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3088s), I, I guess I just what I'm trying to do is calm people down with how messy and chaotic it's starting to get. It, it's okay. Messy is okay. Chaotic is okay. Some of the best things on this planet have been rebuilt out of something falling. And so in order for this to be rebuilt, it has to be taken down. And we know, I don't know how that's going to happen. I do know it's happening, right? We [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3118s) much know that it's happening. Um, it could still take a couple years, it could take a month, who knows, right? The thing is, is I just want those inside and those that are on the outside that are, um, worried about the mess is that there's no way to do this without it getting messy. It's just, there's no way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3138s)

Yeah. I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't have to be taken down in the sense of being raised to the ground. It needs to be taken down in the sense that the power structures at the top need to be dismantled. The power needs to be handed back to the individual localities. And from the leadership of the individual localities, the power needs to be handed back to the householders and the parents and to the individuals. And the money needs to follow the power back down and be given back to all the people it's taken from. And then, you know, then you can, then you've got a level [playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3168s) field to start from.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3169s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3170s)

It doesn't need, no one's going to come demolish your meeting hall with a bull... oh, goodness gracious, no. It's not like a...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3175s)

Physical mess. It's, yeah, what it is, it's the, it's the taking the power back, yeah, and dispersing it. Right? It's like a child, like Bruce Hales is like a two-year-old child with a lollipop and he really likes his lollipop because it's filled with liquor and he's going to stamp and scream when you take it away. Right? It's more like a...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3193s)

Two-year-old with an AR-15 if you ask. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3196s)

Yeah, exactly. And so we want to take that lollipop away, right? But that also is, it affects it, we've also got to take it away from his sons, right? Yeah. And then there's all these people who have this belief in him that keep giving him more lollipops. Right? So it's, that's what I mean, what I mean a mess is, it's like getting into the core of this situation and somehow breaking through.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3224s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And people...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3227s)

Inside there need to really stop and assess if you're putting your money into a Brethren pension plan, um, you really need to stop and think because if anything ever changes and you leave, you leave all that behind.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3241s)

Or if something changes and the Brethren running that pension plan leave and you stay right where you are, what's going to happen then? What happens if there's another Aberdeen and there's a split and your money's one side of the split and you're on the other? Even if you don't change your religion or your opinions at all, these splits happen. It's, it's a feature of religion and it's schisms. Exactly. And it looks...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3267s)

Like at the top, that's already calculated into his plan because if people leave, that money stays in the pot.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3273s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3274s)

And then he's got access to that money.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3276s)

Yeah. He's already signed over as a nominal trustee of all of the meeting halls.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3282s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3283s)

Since he is the pot.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3286s)

Yeah. Yeah. He is the pot.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3288s)

He is the belly and everything. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3290s)

Yeah. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3292s)

No, that's exactly what I was going to say. It's like most prudent people, which I would like to think is the majority of the Brethren existing on the inside would say, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." It's a really bad idea. And that's exactly what they're doing. And just to make that clear to them is kind of my target.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3315s)

Yeah. I mean, perhaps we should change it a letter or two and say, "Don't put all your eggs in one bastard."

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3320s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3321s)

And we had, we had a computer, um, the lady that does their computer IT work and she came on here and she told us that Streamline system is set up to to circulate screenshots of what you're looking at on your computer and it goes back to Sydney. Now, I don't know if you can say that any clearer because there's still a lot of people in there that are going, "Oh, no, he would never do that." That came from an IT person who has never been in the meeting. She just knew what she was generating. And it's the same thing with their cell phones. There was a case in, I won't say where it was, but a young couple that was planning on leaving, sold everything except the house, get on the plane, they're going to fly to the new place that they're going to live. And lo and behold, on their layover, three brothers met them at the plane and [convinced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3381s) them not to go.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3383s)

And...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3384s)

Then afterwards, the story was, "It was so wonderful that the Lord interrupted them." It wasn't the Lord that interrupted you. It was Bruce Hales. He sent his minions because you are on Life360. He knew where you were going. Yeah. So don't confuse Bruce and the Lord because they're two different things.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3403s)

No.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3404s)

I don't know if you can say it any clearer, clearer, but people are, they're not listening.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3411s)

Well, the, uh, I love the way they, uh, they speak to divine intervention because that, that very nearly stopped me coming to Canada altogether. I planned everything in secret. My, uh, my just like my first visit to see my now ex-wife, I basically booked everything in secret, booked a ticket, uh, taken a few days off work. And I got to Heathrow airport and the peebs had somehow found out that I was flying to Montreal. So my, my boss, and we [actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3441s) used email quite a lot, but he knew I had a BlackBerry at that point. He sent me an email saying, "Don't get on that plane."

 So I went to, went to check in my bags very rebelliously and they said, "Your flight is cancelled." Because I immediately found a BA representative and said, "Look, I've got to get to Montreal. My fiance's waiting there for me. I can't miss this flight." So she very quickly got me on a flight through Boston. And I was aware at that moment that that could have been a moment where I could [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3471s) just turned around and said, "That's God telling me not to get on that plane to Montreal. There, you'll commit yourself to something you can't handle."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3479s)

Yeah, this is a really good point. Just dealing with the things that are coming through in the last week, it's Carman brought up a really good point that what they call this divine intervention or the Lord speaking is you've got to really be able to see through the facade of, "Is this someone tracking you or is this literally you needing to make this break, get through it and get to where you need to go and realize that no, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3509s) is, that wasn't the Lord speaking to you. That was them tracking you. You need to go." Um, wow.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3517s)

Right along that same line is when Bruce is so-called prophesying that things are going to happen, predicting down the road something's going to happen. He's not a prophet. He's just reading the news. He's got different sources than you do because he doesn't have filters on his computer, right? And so he nearly has the, the foreknowledge and he puts it out there as though he's prophesying.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3543s)

Half his prophecies don't come true anyway. I mean, the Tesco one didn't, a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah, the London Olympics, which were famously successful, he said, "The London Olympics are going to be a bloodbath." And you know, the worst thing that happened is Boris Johnson got stuck on a high wire or something. Yeah. Didn't he also say...

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3569s)

Richard, "The London Olympics are not going to go ahead and we won't be here for them"?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3574s)

Oh, right. Okay. It's a trick. It's a trick where someone in that position, they make a whole lot of prophecies. And of course, people only remember the ones where he gets it right. And the ones where it doesn't come about, that's not new. So you don't remember it or they have something, "Well, you know, the Lord intervened and changed it," sort of thing. So he has this air of being a prophet. But in fact, if you look at things he said, half of them don't happen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3604s)

You know, and I think this is really why he keeps them uneducated, right? Why the universities, I mean, I mean, there's lots of leaders that didn't allow the universities. But if I could say one thing to those that are inside is get yourself an extra, an extra device. Get yourself an extra laptop, hide it and just start researching with this mind of like, "I'm going to be open. What do I think? How do I think?" And yes, as much as he taught you in this last city seminar to get away with natural [thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3634s), natural thinking is really important. Natural thinking is your voice, your soul coming inside your body and being this, you're made in the like image of God. 

You get to come through and you are enacting that. So get yourself into the hands of books. Get yourself, you know, challenge them about taking courses. I think that's the biggest thing that I would love to see changed in there is that they get to go and take university courses, right? Yeah. I mean they, there was something I read just recently how they were rebutting that and saying that that, that wasn't true that they do get to take university courses. Well, you know what? No, it's not. It's like these business courses, these accounting courses, these [courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3675s) that just keep you focused on how to bring in more money. It's not someone being like you, "What, I want to be a doctor and I'm going to go get my doctorate." It's not someone being like, "Okay, I'd like to become a psychologist. I'm going to go take my PhD in psychology." And it's not, you know, or, "I want to become a math teacher or whatever." That's not allowed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3694s)

Not an option.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3695s)

And if you don't have the money to go get a second laptop, go to the public library.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3700s)

Yeah, get on the library. Libraries are great places.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3703s)

And guess what? It doesn't even filter out all our podcasts like your, like your, um, Streamline 360 does or whatever it is. Do it on a library computer. It's free. It doesn't cost you a penny.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3717s)

Exactly. And that, that going back to my experience, my early experience with it was I was terrified that I would be exposed to something, uh, like to opposers as they were referred to then, or to do something, uh, like really defining that would really, uh, mess up my mind. Instead, it opened my mind to the fact that there are really nice Christian and other people out there who have never been exposed to anything in peebdom. And those people, if you approach them with an open [mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3747s), they will open your own mind and that enables you to see that the future isn't bound up in the Exclusive Brethren. It's, they're just a very tiny drop in a very, very small, very small bucket in the middle of the ocean.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3764s)

We have it at 0.0000673 or something like that. It's very tiny.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3770s)

Yeah. I kind of, when I came to that, the sort of mental image I had in my mind was like this sort of massive anthill teeming with ants and there was just one little ant over there and that was the PBCC. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, it is, it's more than that. I mean, an anthill probably has, you know, maybe a couple of million ants, a really big anthill. Well, they're a smaller proportion than that. They're not even one ant in an anthill. They're kind of one bacteria on the bum of an ant in an anthill.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3801s)

Yeah, it's, it's a nice analogy. And when you, when you actually allow your mind to open enough to that, I mean, that, that's a mindset that might be less difficult now for the younger generation who are on the inside of the Brethren to get over. But most people who criticize the president are not doing it for fun or to mock them or to belittle them. They're just doing it simply because they can see something that you cannot see from the inside.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3833s)

You know what, I'm going to read another paragraph of this, of this, this letter only because it, you just said it. Um, "I just wanted to say thank you for being a voice for those of us who have not figured out how or been strong enough to use our own, for being a place people like myself can find themselves able to directly relate to others on. I saw sending an email as an opportunity to try to find my voice, to do something, start somewhere. I'm not sure I'm prepared [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3863s) or know what comes next, but I can't keep trying to ignore it." 

And he's just taking like one step and realizing that that one step is going to shed a layer of fear that's been imposed on you. I know it seems fearful. We've all been through it. It is very scary taking those first few steps. But man, it is so freeing when you start getting to think for yourself. And I mean, honestly, that's what it's, that's the whole point of being here is to being able to experience yourself in a human body [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3900s) feel what it feels like to be with all of these emotions. There's not supposed to be someone over top of you controlling everything that you do. And I know that a lot of people don't think of it like that, but I need you to think of it like that. 

You are literally being told you get permission to get married. You get permission to have to go and see a baby on, like, I say somebody has a baby, the second one, you have to get permission to go there. You've got, you can't go to university. You've got all these things that [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3930s) have to be accountable for. You are not getting to think on your own. I guarantee you, yes, there is a lot of cults out here. There is. There's Scientology. We've got Latter-day Saints. We've got all these different, they're all underneath the same umbrella. But there are Christian groups out here that when you walk in, you're walking into joy and peace and freedom that sets you free. It's like, it's out here. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3960s) literally is out here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3962s)

And I mean, even the notorious cults like Scientology don't exert nearly the same degree of control that the Brethren do. I mean, they're way more extreme.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3973s)

And people are voluntarily in a lot of those groups too.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3978s)

Yes, exactly.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3980s)

That's a key thing.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=3981s)

I think that one of the really shocking parts about the PBCC cult is the self-aggrandizement. They think they are so important. You know, you hear of some of these election things and they approach some of these people that they're trying to get elected like, "Like, you need our advice. We are from the PBCC." They don't understand. They are just a little pea in the middle of the garden. You know, nobody has to listen to PBCC advice. You are not that important.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4015s)

But they'll approach the president of America with the kind of attitude of a condescending attitude that like, "We're, we're deigning to pass this invaluable golden advice to you and you should be jolly thankful, Mr. President."

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4029s)

"If you want to win, here's what you should say. Here's how you should make your next speech." Really? You know, 50,000 people for a Volunteers football game, there's going to be a hundred thousand people in that stadium alone. Rather, there's half as many as in that stadium and they're all over the world. That's the reality of it. They're just a little tiny pea in the middle of a garden.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4058s)

It doesn't make you elite. You're not the chosen ones.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4067s)

No, they ran from 'exclusive' for a reason.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4070s)

Yeah, yeah. And it's, um, that's one of the things I've really struggled with myself is to have real humility, that real humility, not the affected humility like you tend to experience on the inside there. "Oh, you know, I, I couldn't, I couldn't take the reading. I couldn't, uh, I couldn't get up, but I will anyway because I'm humble. Look at me." To have real, uh, intellectual humility as well and just to, just to give yourself even one instant just to think, "Maybe a lot of what I know is actually a lie." Or, "Could it be that, you know, the whole system isn't necessarily right just because it's all I've ever known in my life?"

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4119s)

I mean, I really believe there's true Christians in there. There's true kind people in there. There really are. And that's what makes, I mean, my parents are, I mean, that's what makes me sad is because these people are so taken advantage of, right? And that's the part I think what I do, what I do when I come on here, right, is to me, it is, it's my parents and I'm fighting for, right? It's my nieces and nephews that I'm fighting for. They don't have a voice. They don't have a voice. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4149s) they don't have a voice because they don't realize that their voice matters. You know? And I think it's super important for those that, um, if you are in a position to share your voice, it's super important too. It really is super important too.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4166s)

Yeah, yeah. If you, if you don't speak up, you're technically, you're consenting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4172s)

I, I, I, that's a belief of mine 100%. Yeah, I have that belief very much so.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4178s)

Yeah, yeah. That's why I respect, um, your courage, uh, with this podcast especially, uh, but it's stuff that needs to be said. It's not, it's not, uh, us having a rant about a system because of what some, uh, some group of people did to us. It's an ongoing situation and there needs to be a solution.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4199s)

Yeah, I agree. I agree.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4202s)

And the truth is a very powerful thing. I mean, you might say, "Well, what can a handful of us do against 55,000 Brethren with their billions of dollars and everything else? It's futile." But it's not futile because their whole system is built up on lies. The whole system of lies stacked upon lies stacked upon lies, but, and that's what they have to depend on. All they can do to defend themselves is tell more and more lies. But what we have is the truth. We just keep stating the truth and [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4232s) actually devastating for them.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4233s)

And I think it's important to realize that I want those people in there that are those true Christians, right, that if this was to crumble down, your faith's not going to go anywhere. That's you. That's your connection. That nobody can take that from you. And as much as Bruce has fed that to you that, "Oh, if you leave, if you do this or if you, you know, contact an opposer or you've got these," it, that it affects you. [It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4263s) doesn't. That, that faith that you have, that is yours. And no matter what happens around you, what happens on the outside of you shouldn't affect that connection and faith that you have inside you. If it's true, it doesn't affect it. That's yours to fall back on. So I need all those people in there to realize that no matter what happens, you have you and your connection and your faith to fall back on. Nobody [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4294s) take that from you. You don't give that power to Bruce. Don't give that power to the leaders. Don't give that power to the priests. That's you and your connection.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4308s)

Yeah, I think it's a big point, a big, um, breakthrough when you kind of realize, you make that division in your mind and you realize that the Brethren is not Christianity. Because what the course they try and teach you and indoctrinate you in there is that this is the real Christianity. We're holding the ground for all of Christendom and every other kind of Christianity is just a kind of defiled and watered down version of the, the real thing that we have in here. Well, you know, they're actually [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4338s) this crazy outlying splinter of, of a sect of a division of a backwater of some 18th-century cult that was once vaguely connected with Christianity. I mean, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but they're not a mainstream Christian church, that's for sure.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4359s)

No, that brings to light something that, well, I certainly remember it being drummed into us in the few years I was a current peeb member, was that the fear of God always comes before the fear of man. And if Bruce Hales is not God, why is everything they do under the fear of him, not under the fear of God? Like, if you truly feared God, would you respect what any person tells you if you, even if they're supposedly the mouthpiece of God? If you truly fear the God, would you, would you, um, put just the words of one man before him?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4404s)

It's very interesting because what we're seeing increasingly is that they're de-emphasizing reading the Bible and it's all just about reading the ministry. And the reason is that there's plenty of texts in the Bible that very directly condemn exactly what the Brethren do. Yeah. So yeah, they're just inventing their own new religion.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4429s)

Let's just, I want to reread something again that was in the Sydney seminar, and I know we've got it in a prior podcast, but I want to reread it again. So this was the very first speaker on the family one. I'm going to reread it again. "So by the grace of God, you and I have been specially selected to be in this holy fellowship in what is approximately," and it's got his percentage, "of the total world population. What a tremendous favor for all of us to be included every day. From what our beloved brother spoke about, the universal meetings [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4459s) the only one right place." So here's my challenge.

 This is what I'm going to put out there is, what if, okay? So let's take this. You've been specifically selected. What if you were specifically selected to be in there to give the true voice? What if it's all along you've been waiting for this moment to stand up and be like, "This isn't right"? Because I believe there's a lot of you in there [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4489s) were specifically selected to stand up and say, "This isn't right. There is no, no, no, no. You cannot just say..." I mean, to me, the sun shines on everybody, right? The sun doesn't choose just 50,000 people to shine on. It shines on everybody. And how, what, what a horrible thing to preach to young children that you are the [specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4519s), especially selected person and the only one right place. And then you wonder why you have bullying. You wonder why there's this hierarchy position that's rampant through everything. That's why. But I am going to tell you that you weren't, there's a bunch of you in there that were specially selected to stand up and say, "This doesn't feel right. This isn't right. This is going against every grain of who I am."

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4551s)

Yeah. I mean, the, the way they teach that is painfully, painfully like the kind of Hitler Youth movement where they got all these sort of blonde and blue-eyed young guys and gave them identical haircuts and told them that, you know, "You're the elite. You're the elite. You're the master race." And yes, did that come along with bullying and nastiness? Sure did. It's very similar.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4577s)

Allegedly... let me just turn parental controls off on my computer here. But so, it has been brought to our attention that there were some brothers that saw Hitler's handbook in an office, uh, where the Hales were. And I mean, it was asked why it was there. And Carmen, what was the response?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4601s)

This is Mein Kampf, right?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4604s)

Yeah, Mein Kampf, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4606s)

Yeah. And what did they say back to the person that question? The response was, "There's a lot of good information in there for controlling the masses." So that justifies having Hitler's handbook in your study.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4624s)

And I mean, as independent confirmation of that, John Hales actually quoted from it in one of his readings, which I was very, very surprised to see at the time. I think possibly he'd just forgotten where he got that particular quotation from, the quotation about the big lie theory. But yeah, he quoted it very accurately.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4643s)

So, I mean, absolutely terrify anybody that's in there. Yes, you think that your leaders are reading from Hitler's handbook and then, and not only that, they're justifying it by saying, "There's good information in there for controlling the masses."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4661s)

And I mean, you can take that however you want. He could have been referring in whatever way, but for that handbook to be in the hands of a man of God...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4669s)

There's no justification for it.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4671s)

Not at all.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4672s)

No, there's no immunity, uh, for anybody to, to take in literature like that and to assume that there's good life lessons to be learned from it, regardless.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4685s)

The only good thing for that book is to put it in, put it in a burn barrel for a weenie roast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4688s)

Yeah, or an outhouse. Yeah. I don't know if I'd want to eat a hot dog though off of smoke that was coming from the book. Um...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4698s)

Well, it's not good, it's not good to eat the hot dogs when you burn your ministry either, because like all these little papers come up and it gets stuck in your bun.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4705s)

Like, um, like one of my locals, um, he was a little bit of a product of, uh, inbreeding, but he, uh, decided it'd be a good idea to burn the white papers in a barrel on their farm. So he took out about 10 years worth of white books, put them all in a barrel, lit them on fire with diesel, and then he distributed them over about 10 miles of countryside. People were returning this ministry for months afterwards because it had the address labels on it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4737s)

Strange kind of hailstones.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4745s)

But...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4745s)

So just going back to it, I think it's, I think it was important. I've been dying to like have this podcast to put that in there, is that you guys have to realize that when we, I mean, there's so many people refer to the Exclusive Brethren, aka PBCC, as so many things to what Hitler did, right? And you can see how and why.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4765s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4767s)

I know you guys have fear. I know you don't know how it's going to be, how you're going to do it, or how, like sometimes you just have to do it and know that it'll be okay, right? Like the amount of things that I was protected from that could have got, like there's so many stories that I have of what I was protected from that I know I, I just know why I was protected from them, right? You're not going to be thrown out into this world and all, you're not going to be chewed up and gobbled up. It's not, you can think for yourself. You have a heart. You've got a conscience. You've got a gut reaction. You're, it's not, I'm going to tell you that it's way [easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4809s) out here than what you're doing in there.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4811s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4812s)

And if you wait for a good time to do it, there's never going to be a good time. You have to make up your mind. You have to load five kids in a car and you got to drive 1500 miles away and realize that you're going to start over. But it's possible to do and whether or not you're committed to do that shows where your values are.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4834s)

Yeah, and I've had numerous people ask me when they learned I've escaped from a cult, they've asked, "Do you have any regret?" And they're often surprised when I say, "Of course I have regret. I regret that I had to leave my family in there. I regret all the hurt that I must have caused my parents. But I don't want to get to the end of my life and regret not having made that decision." No matter what big decision you make in your life, there is going to be regret. You have to deal with it. Every [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4864s) decision comes with a degree of regret, but that's balanced out by the benefit. That's very true. Yourself being able to feel actually free and not in fear constantly, that's worth dealing with a little bit of regret.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4878s)

Yeah, what bigger regret could you have than getting to the very end of your life on your deathbed and realizing that your entire life, the only life you'd ever have, you had given over to a cult. Yeah, yeah, that should be terrifying. It is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4894s)

Yeah, and it is. I mean, and with everything in life, right, nothing's just handed to us on a silver platter and it's this beautiful, magnificent rainbow and, um, everything comes with consequences. Everything comes with, um, a positive side and a negative side. There's a, I call it a light side and a heavy side. There's everything. That's just what planet Earth is all about, right? This key is, is like for my end goal, this end goal is to be able to have this [mainstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4924s) Christian church, this like other mainstream Christian church, where it's a choice. It's a choice you make every day of like, "Hey, I feel like going to church today because I need some extra help." So you wake up and you go to church that day and you're not scorned at, you're not controlled, you're not told that, "Hey, you can't do this with that person, you can't do that with that person." That's what, that's my end goal is to have that.

 And it's by the choices of the people that are in there and obviously us exposing [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4954s) we're exposing out here that is going to make that happen. And it's again, that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about it's going to be messy. Those are the messy parts I'm talking about, but the messy parts don't have to last forever, right? It's just a matter of getting through this chaotic middle ground of making the change through the shifts. I know it can happen. I 100% have faith in it. Um, I just don't know if it'll happen in my lifetime, but I certainly hope it does. But it's [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=4984s) is something I think every one of us can be accountable to for a part. 

Um, I had talked to an ex-member, um, yesterday who I had referred in a podcast about, um, the monkey being in the cage and you know, we keep it locked up there. And he said to me, he said, "I really had my monkey in the cage." He's like, "I'm just realizing I had the monkey in the cage." He's like, this, we were, he was so ashamed of that that he was a part of the Exclusive Brethren [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5014s) he didn't want to go back and look at it, but he also realized that in order to have this fulfilled life, he knows he has to let the monkey out of the cage and he's got to be able to start dealing with it. And he's been finding these podcasts very healing and therapeutic. And so I guess it's one of those things that is that we all need to look at what we were raised in. We all need to look at what we're in. How else are we going to make changes if you don't look at what you were in or what your past was? That's how big change happens on this planet is when people have that courage to turn around, look at what their past was and be like, "You know what? That's not right." It's like a burning building and walking past a burning building that's screaming with children and you just walk by it. In my good conscience, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5058s) couldn't do that. But that's what it is in our rearview mirror. There's a burning building with screaming people in it, right? I just can't turn around and be like, "Okay, I'm not going to do anything." And the only reason I came forward now is because things started popping up and I know, okay, this now we can do it. This is the time to do it.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5076s)

Yeah, yeah, a movement  started forming.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5081s)

Yeah.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5082s)

Yeah, they're stopping it now.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5088s)

The train is rolling.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5090s)

The train is rolling, fully loaded. It is fully loaded.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5095s)

Time to, time to switch the points and send the, uh, the Brucey train off on a diversion. Yeah, the hellbound train.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5101s)

And there's no alcohol in it.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5103s)

Yeah, only water.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5105s)

There's no way to go to sleep in it. Anyhow, um, well Daniel, we're very grateful you came on and, um, shared your experience with Exclusive Brethren and leaving and I think it'll be very insightful. It's just super important to get everybody's stories because everybody will relate to somebody else's story some way.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5129s)

Yeah, right. There's something different, but there's also in all of the stories that you've put on so far, there's been, um, like an aha moment where you can connect with that. And I'm sure those on the inside who have the courage or, um, even just to dare themselves to listen will realize that the majority of these people, they're just talking about their experiences because they don't want those on the inside to live through them anymore. Yeah, to realize that they can speak out. And yeah, I'm really grateful for you [allowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5159s) me on the, on the podcast today to just to tell my side of the story, even, uh, relevant or less relevant as it might be.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5168s)

Oh, I think it was very relevant. I think it was very interesting. Every story is relevant. I like to tell people, I'm like, if you don't think you had trauma... I mean, we had Bradley McCallum come on here and he emailed me and said he didn't have a story. And I was like, "Hey, anybody, anybody who left has a story." Just the process of separation is a story. That's what we're really trying to focus on is this whole rule of separation. So if you don't think you have a story, I guarantee you, you do just because you had to leave and you're separated. But Bradley comes on and I mean, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5198s) was one of the most deeply profound podcasts that shook the foundation inside there, right? Like it was, it had such a deep impact. So I challenge everybody who doesn't think that they have a story to tell themselves, yes, you do. Everybody's story is important.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5216s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There's a way to, way to present it. And it, uh, I think you guys have hit the winning recipe. I really admire what you're doing with this. I can only see it getting bigger, like the snowball. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5231s)

Yeah, it's a boulder. It's gathering moss.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5233s)

Yeah, and I hope it's gonna, I hope it's gonna gather from inside as well.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5240s)

In Canada, it's a snowball and it's got... it's winter, it's not quite big. Anyhow, okay, thank you so much Daniel.

### [**Daniel Mounter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbNP6dStBE&t=5251s)

Thank you very much. Okay, take care everyone. Much to you all.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
