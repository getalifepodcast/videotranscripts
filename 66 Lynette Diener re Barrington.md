## Summary

Residents of the Chicago suburb of Barrington turned to the Get-a-Life team for help when the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church came to town. The secretive cult is trying to secure a 32 acre site in Barrington for a huge complex of a 2000 seater hall, a school and a superstore.
Rather than make an honest approach, we believe that the PBCC corrupted two Barrington Park district Councilors with offers of multi-million-dollar realty deals to induce them to push through the sale of the site at a fraction of market value. The PBCC then sent a delegation to the public meeting about the land who lied egregiously about their intentions, and the capacity of the proposed room. Watch Steve Johnstone and Dale Diener fumble their way through a highly charged meeting of Barrington residents. We can't quite figure out why they were chosen for this - maybe it could be that Dale Diener was a former employer of Unispace and his direct connection to the Hales team placed him there?
Get-a-Life was represented at the meeting by Lynette Diener – a Chicago resident and  former member who has been quietly helping the team for over a year.
When the public meeting erupted in protest, the PBCC them tried to push the sale through BEFORE a scheduled second meeting at which the issue was to be decided.
Barrington residents legally blocked the sale, whereupon the PBCC hired a top flight lawyer specializing in religious freedom to fight their case…meanwhile a public protest was held, with “No PBCC” posters and placards, all filmed by national news networks on the ground and from a helicopter.
The drama continues, but here we present the first of two or more podcasts that take you right to the front line of the fight against this insanely wealthy and ruthless cult. We added the updated survivor video as a harsh reminder of the mess the PBCC leave in it's trail.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=27s)

Thank you.

Hi, everyone. Welcome back to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we are joined by Carman and Richard is going to be joining us in a few minutes. And our special guest today is Lynette Diener. Lynette is joining us from Chicago, and we are going to dive into the Chicago meeting room build slash school that a lot of the residents are in opposition to.

So Lynette, why don't you introduce yourself and let the viewers and listeners know where you're from and what made you leave the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=70s)

Okay. Hi, I'm Lynette. I live in Chicago. I've been here since 1990\. I grew up in Maple Creek. So why did we leave? Things in 2003 got bad, if people, if Brethren remember that. And in 2003, I got pregnant and I did not know in my heart if the [baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=101s) would be born in fellowship or out of fellowship.

And to give you an idea, we didn't escape until 2009\. So for all those years, I pondered and wanted to leave, but didn't feel like it was the right time.

But this was like back a long time ago. Back then I was praying that I would know without a doubt when it was the right time to leave, that I would not question it, I would not second guess it, I would just know. And I did. It happened. It happened at a morning meeting, Lord's Supper, [six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=152s) o'clock a.m. meeting. It was right after Leeds in May of 2009\. These had just happened the weekend before and that those meetings was when Bruce had said something to the effect that to show the support to the people that are around him all the time, like his what's that called, like the close, the people that are kind of like his Brethren bodyguards, like they're always with him. I don't know how to describe that.

But yeah, we call it, but yeah, the mafia. So they, so the way that we would show our support for the Lord's servant to never miss the Lord's Supper. And that was one thing that I never did miss because I thought it was Lord's Supper. I thought that was to [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=208s) like the Lord has...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=211s)

Like it was becoming more, do you find it was becoming more about the Lord's Supper was becoming more about Bruce versus, well...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=220s)

That, that's, it had, that at that point it did. So that was the first Sunday when another mom was out and she averaged about two to three morning meetings a year. And she was out, and it was very surprising to see her out.

And so on the way home, I just remember we were sitting at a light, at the red light. And I said, why was so-and-so? I wonder why so-and-so was out. Because I hadn't been out a couple of nights that week previous, and apparently it was because we were going to show our support for Bruce Hales by coming to the morning meeting. So this mother didn't come to the morning meeting for the Lord, she came for Bruce Hales. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=269s) and I knew, I like we were still sitting at the red light and I was having break that day so I had to go home and get ready for break. We had break, I had a house full of company, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, the whole thing, like my one of my big meals. And then I never, never went to meeting again.

If I could change things, I would have told my kids, well, because I didn't, I didn't know it either. Like I only knew it when I knew it. So there [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=299s) nothing like we were going to leave on a certain date, nothing like that. I was waiting for, I knew that I would know. So that's what happened. And so my kids never got to say goodbye to anybody. They never had closure. I never had, none of us had closure for cousins, aunts, uncles. Thankfully their grandparents had a little bit to do with the kids periodically, like it wasn't often, but it was like they didn't like they didn't [come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=329s) over or anything, but they would let the kids drop off a batch of muffins or something like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=335s)

You had some really nasty priestly visits at the, when you left too, didn't you? Yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=339s)

The priestly visits lasted for on and off. I mean, nine, like at least even until like five years later, they were still. So yeah, I was told that, well, I was asked at a priestly, are you okay, Lynette, with your four children spending eternity in hell?

And I was like, you know, that actually doesn't work with me anymore. You're not going to scare me with those fear-based statements. Like I'm not, it doesn't work.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=373s)

And you had found a new church by this time, right? 

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=377s)

We found, yeah, we found a church pretty quickly and that was a “rival table.” Taking communion at another church was called a rival table, we found out, and that wasn't good. So I started getting, they didn't know what to do with me because after we left and I started realizing that there's a lot of Christian wives that aren't submissive, like you don't have to be so submissive. I think it kind of shocked everybody, but I started realizing that I don't have to, like this is, this is wrong, this this level of of submissiveness when you just, you can't even...

So when these priestly visits were happening and I was getting a little bit loud, one of the arguments I had was I asked this one brother who was, he has since passed on, but I asked him like after he told me that my child, if I was okay spending my four kids spending eternity in hell for my actions, like for because I was taking them away from where they were sovereignly placed. Like the Lord sovereignly placed your four children in holy fellowship of God's son and you are taking them away from that. So you are, your kids [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=451s) be spending eternity in hell.

And so I said to him something to the effect like, so do you think that heaven will just be for the Brethren or or what do you think heaven's going to be? I said, how big is your god, the god that you believe in or the god that you follow? And he goes, heaven will be filled with the Brethren. And I said, so you are telling me that the god you believe in is only big enough for 40 to 50,000 people? And I said, because if that, I don't want to follow that god. Like if that's all he's capable of is just the Brethren going to heaven. And he told [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=499s) that he hopes to see a Protestant or two.

So a Protestant or two. Anyways, so I wish back then we didn't have cell phones. I just wish, I wish that those were pieces were recorded because anyways, he's passed on, so I wonder if there's more than a Protestant or two up there.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=528s)

That's a bit tough on the Catholics, isn't it? 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=537s)

Thank you for sharing, Lynette, that was, yeah. But we're here today to dive into the Chicago incident that is happening right now with Chicago PBCC members are trying to buy a piece of land known as Area N in South Barrington and the residents are not happy. And they have obviously reached out to us and asked us for some information and we were able to, we actually did up a little video for them which we're going to share right [away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=567s) so that you guys can have an understanding of what we're dealing and then you can see later on in this podcast of what they're saying.

So we're going to start off with Richard's explanation of the PBCC meeting halls and how many people they hold and what they look like.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=586s)

And I've been involved in the design and construction of their church buildings from about 1990 right through to 2015 when I left the sect. My father built one of their first modern meeting halls in Cambridge in the UK when I was 20 years old. I worked on that construction site from breaking ground till completion. I've built architectural models for a meeting hall in Sweden. I've worked on several hall construction sites in the UK and [Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=616s) and I've visited probably about 100 different PBCC meeting halls around the globe in the UK, Australia, Germany, Canada and the USA. The last hall I worked on was just over the border in Oxbow, Saskatchewan and is identical to the hall proposed for this site in Barrington. That was completed in 2010\.

I should add that these are not churches in the normal sense of the word. Even PBCC members refer to them as meeting rooms. Conference center would probably be the most accurate description. The word church actually has negative connotations within the PBCC, and it's been eliminated from their version of the Bible. They have no religious architectural ornaments, no steeple or bells, no altar, no crosses, no piano, [organ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=670s) or musical instruments, no flowers, no stained glass, in fact, no windows at all.

The design of these halls is all centrally dictated from the HQ in Sydney, Australia, and they're all identical down to the last detail. You can walk into one of these halls anywhere on the globe, and there is no clue as to what country you're in. It will be exactly the same as your local hall back home. This means I can tell you rather accurately what the PBCC are proposing [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=700s) build here, despite the very limited plans they have submitted.

These halls are very simple structures. They consist of two main parts: a square auditorium with concentric rings of bench seats and a large foyer with coat pegs, restrooms on either side. The one thing that has changed over the years is the size of the halls and this reflects the exponential growth in the number of PBCC members. In the 1970s the auditoriums were 50 foot by 50 foot, in the 1980s they were 60 foot by 60 foot, in the [1990s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=735s) they went up to 70 by 70 foot and that was considered to be a 1,000-seat meeting room.

The current design which originated in the 2000s has a 90 by 90 foot auditorium and that's what we have here. A 90 by 90 foot room plus the foyer and storage rooms comes to just 17,000 square feet and that is what it says on the plan. This is considered to be a 2,000-seat room. As I'll explain later, there are [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=765s) few images online showing the interior of a PBCC meeting hall because they're not open to the public. The only time a non-member gets to see the inside is when they outgrow a hall and it's put on the market. This video is from a real estate advertisement for the London UK Hall, which has a total area of 7,000 square feet. The new hall proposed for Barrington will be identical to this, save that at 16,000 square feet it will be two and a half times larger.

So you'll have noticed a few things. High security gates, high fences, cameras, floodlights. These are typical and Barrington will be the same. The entire site will be behind six-foot steel security fences. You will notice that there is an extraordinary sliding door between the foyer and the meeting room. This is significant, as I will explain later. So here is a detailed plan of a PBCC 17,000 square foot meeting hall. This is what you will get in Barrington.

On the left, the foyer with male and female restrooms on opposite sides. Then the huge 40-foot wide sliding door into the hall which has octagonal rings of bench seating. There is a 15-foot wide side corridor which also has a 40-foot sliding door to the hall and on the far right there is a series of large storage rooms. Also at the right, outside of the hall you can see three huge air conditioning units, each of these is the size [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=937s) a semi-trailer. These are many times larger than you would expect for a building of this size.

The claimed capacity of this hall based on the length of fixed seating is 1,156 persons. This assumes a comfortably low density arrangement where there's a few inches of air space between each person. This however is not how the hall is used. For special occasions the brethren are crammed into the fixed seating at a very high density, hip to hip, shoulder [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=967s) shoulder, practically full body contact. Once the fixed seating is filled then the aisles are filled with stacking chairs which are brought in from those large storerooms at the back. Members will carry their chair into the room to the next available space in the aisle, put it down and sit on it. In this way all the aisles can be completely filled.

The next plan shows how this is done. First plan here shows the fixed seating only. And then the second plan shows what it looked like when all the aisles, including the circulating aisle, have been completely filled with loose chairs. The third plan shows how the main foyer and side corridor are filled with chairs by opening the sliding doors which connect them to the main hall. Now the reason for the sliding doors becomes clear. They almost double the seating capacity. With this number of persons crammed into such a small place, the huge air conditioning units were essential to prevent everyone from overheating and to pump enough oxygen into the room.

Now if we look closely at the restrooms we can see more evidence of this practice. There are no less than 71 toilets and urinals provisioned for 71 people to urinate or defecate simultaneously. Again, several times the number you would expect for a building of this size. There is also documentary evidence to this practice. The PBCC is led by a single charismatic leader or elect vessel whose every word is transcribed and published in bound volumes which are [distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1066s) to every member. The current leader is Bruce D. Hales from Sydney, Australia, and the previous leader was his father, John S. Hales. Here is a 2010 quotation from Bruce Hales, taken from the Brethren's own printed literature.

“Father used to say that four square feet per person. I suppose that he was allowing for the little people, so if we had 440, you could probably get 100 people in there, you'd have to get a little bit more air conditioning.”

The context of this quote is the number of persons that can be fitted into a meeting hall. Here's quoting from his father, John S. Hales. He gives the example of a small 440 square foot room having the capacity for over 100 persons. In other words, the number of persons equals the number of square feet divided by four. The auditorium of the hall planned for Barrington is 90 feet square. 90 by 90 equals 8,100 square feet. [Dividing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1131s) this by four gives 2,025 persons, which is why this is referred to in the Brethren as a 2,000-seat hall.

The foyer is 50 by 63 feet, giving an area of 3,150 square feet and will hold 787 persons. The section of the side corridor facing the sliding door is 40 by 15 feet, giving an additional 600 square feet and will seat 150 persons. The total capacity of the room for special occasions then is about 2,962 persons.

Each time the Brethren hold a special occasion, they print a booklet for the event with a list of all those invited. These booklets do indeed show that about 3,000 persons may attend meetings in these 17,000 square feet halls. What about fire regulations and fire exits? These are completely ignored. As I'll explain, the PBCC have a very strained and adversarial relationship with the world at large which they consider to be ruled by Satan. As such, when it suits their [purpose,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1200s) they do not feel constrained by worldly laws when they're in their own sanctuary.

The only plan I have is this rather hard to read one from the Barrington Observer. We can see at the top there is a proposed school with gym building and attached to the school a proposed store. This store will be a Campus & Co superstore, the Brethren's own members only supermarket, the purpose of which is to capture all the members expenditure and keep it within the sect rather than going to worldly [shops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1231s) in the communities in which they live. These are very nice high-end supermarkets but are most definitely not open to the public.

One thing that may be of concern to Barrington residents is that wherever possible, Campus & Co outlets apply for liquor license and do a very heavy trade in alcohol, consumption of strong liquor being an integral part of the Brethren culture. The picture here is of the liquor section of a Campus & Co store in the UK. If we zoom in on the plan of the store building, we can see an extension with a diagonal corner that faces a straight section of road. This is a loading bay [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1270s) semi-trailers and suggests that it will not just be a Campus & Co outlet, but a hub store which will contain refrigerated warehousing and storage and will be used to supply smaller stores in the surrounding region.

The representatives of the PBCC probably forgot to mention that in addition to the church traffic and the school traffic, there will also be shoppers and semi-trailers of groceries using the site. Another point to make regarding this plan, the parking spaces [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1300s) drawn are a good 10 feet wide. The standard width for a parking space is 8 feet. The result of this is that whatever number of parking spaces the Brethren say they will be providing, in practice they get about 20% more. They use this same trick on a recent planning application in the UK where a sharp-eyed journalist noticed and called them out on it. That is how I knew to check the size of the spaces on this plan.

There has been very little information available about what the school will look like, but fortunately the PBCC fairly recently completed an almost identical compound to this proposal in the Canadian town of Stonewall near Winnipeg in Manitoba. Here is a Google Aerial view of the completed site.

On the far left, the grey roof building is the 17,000 square foot meeting hall with its large parking lot and on the right the school with a separate gym. Using Google Street View we can drive by and see the building from ground level. This is the back end of the meeting hall.

And here is the front.

So here we can see that same Stonewall meeting hall and this time there's actually one of the Brethren's special occasions or fellowship meetings or three-day meetings as they call them in progress and you can see they've erected an enormous circus type tent in front of the hall which actually connects through into the foyer of the building. And the reason they have this, this is for catering. They have teas. They're providing food in this [hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1411s) here for the attendees. And the reason they have to have the tent is that the foyer is full of chairs. So the space that would normally be used for foyer is full of chairs. So they put up a tent, and in the tent, that's where they have all their kind of coat racks and their food and their catering for the event.

The other thing to know about the way the Brethren organise their gatherings, their meetings, is that in addition to having what they would call a city room, which is this very large 16,000 square feet room you see, they also have local rooms and so for each 50 or so members they will have a local room which will be a much smaller room usually like the size of a bungalow. And in the case of Chicago with the number of Brethren they have that will be moving to this area [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1470s) going to have at least five smaller local meeting halls and typically the way they the way they do this is they buy a house or buy a bungalow, buy a residential lot, and they put up a meeting hall on it.

Occasionally, they'll use the existing structure, but usually they'll bulldoze the house, build a small meeting hall with maybe 25 or 30 parking spaces. So when you get a big brethren meeting hall, keep in mind that within a year or so, you're also going to have five smaller halls all in the same area.

The school is difficult to see from the road, but here is a similar PBCC campus in Ireland.

As a former member, I was amused to hear the PBCC representative say, "we are looking forward to being your neighbours." This is a very long way from being the truth. As mentioned before, the Brethren regard the whole world as being under the influence and power of Satan, along with the inhabitants thereof. That includes the good citizens of Barrington. The 2011 quote below from the elect vessel illustrates this.

“Can the family see that we're dedicated to separation from the world? Well, how would that be practiced? Would they let a neighbor into their house, for instance? Would they let worldly people, would they let their children get involved with other worldly children? See that's the teaching and that should be intrinsically intuitively built up in a household, separation from the world. And then the idea of mixing with your neighbors and that kind of thing, I mean you live, you only live sort of [20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1576s) feet one way and 20 feet the other way from everything pretty much that could take you clean out of the fellowship. So what have we got to do? We've got to provide an atmosphere in our households and control and affection and authority so they don't get involved.”

The term worldly people simply means anyone who's not a member of the Brethren. They regard all such with a mix of fear and suspicion and you need not bother to ask them in for coffee or invite them to your barbecue. They won't be coming. This is an extremely insular and self-serving community who have as little to do with the outside world as they possibly can.

“Don't linger, don't stay, don't mingle, don't mix. Rigid separation. Get out of worldly company as quick as you can.”

They aim to be self-sufficient in every regard, right down to having their own schools, supermarkets and businesses. Brethren do not work for non-brethren businesses. They aim to provide full employment for every member. Even their phones, computers and telecom services are all provided in-house.

This doctrine of separation from the wicked world becomes problematic when they actually need something from the world that they despise, such as planning permission. To get around this, they have an unspoken law that says it's okay to lie and deceive worldly persons in order to obtain what the church needs. to still consider it a very serious offence to lie to other members. This principle is referred to obliquely in the 2012 quote from Bruce Hales below.

“She gave them a false, false lead. That's good. She leaked some very, very valuable information that was completely untrue. She sent them forth, and she would fit into this idea of the secret service, which is a very essential part really of the way the recovery has been sustained.”

An example of this deception is the statement by the PBCC representative that the hall would only be used for a large event once per year or less. What he failed to mention is that a PBCC conference consists of five sessions spread over three days. The number of traffic movements is therefore much greater than for a single event. The spokesperson also says that there are other new halls in nearby cities with the same capacity. This leaves the obvious [question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1722s) as to why such a huge and expensive hall would be built and equipped for such large numbers if the PBCC already has other facilities that they could use.

Recent news from contacts within the PBCC says that they are now using these larger halls for business conferences as well as for religious services. This is another point that the Barrington residents should require to be clarified before planning permission is granted.

In conclusion, this development will contribute nothing whatever to the Barrington community and will generate a very substantial amount of traffic, far more than the misleading numbers presented by the PBCC would indicate. The so-called church is not a place of public worship. It is more akin to an exclusive private club and the entire site will be fenced and gated off with no public use of the land or facilities permitted. The church designation serves only to exempt the [development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1781s) from property tax and thus from contributing to the Barrington community even financially.

I would suggest that the council sit down with the PBCC and obtain an honest and accurate account of what their real intentions are before making a planning decision on this site.

So as far as we understand, this whole project in Barrington started kind of under a veil of secrecy a couple of years ago, height of COVID when it seems like a couple of realtors in the Barrington area got into contact with the Brethren in Chicago and told them that this piece of land might be available.

And the Brethren were given a tour of the site. And the interesting and very significant thing is that those two realtors also happened to be councilors, in fact the president and vice president of the Barrington Park District.

So there was a certain conflict of interest, it now emerges, which we'll go into later. But the Brethren were given the tour of the site, and they were apparently given certain assurances as to the necessary rezoning and planning that would be needed for them to build a meeting hall there.

And the council then proceeded to put out a referendum to the population with the question, could they please put this piece of land up for sale by auction? And I think they tried either two or three times to get the referendum through and on the third try, I think it was, they succeeded. But it later turned out that the residents [immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1905s) adjacent to the site were not included in the referendum. They only sent the referendum forms to persons living a certain distance from the location. So the ones that actually, the residents that were most likely to have an objection to it were not even aware that the referendum took place.

But nonetheless it did and it sort of scraped through with just over 50% approval and the Park District then went ahead and [put](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1936s) up the site for auction. It seems that it wasn't advertised very heavily. Apparently a notice was put into one of the Chicago papers, yeah the Daily Herald, to the effect that this was going to take place, but the Daily Herald is a subscription only newspaper and the subscription is extremely expensive. I've never seen a newspaper with such a high subscription rate. And so this was not, you know, it didn't leave you with the impression that the council were putting every effort into securing the best buyer for the [site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=1976s)

I mean the site of this size, 32-acre, should have been advertised nationally. It could potentially have been used for a university campus outreach place or research laboratory or a specialist school or a postgraduate institute of some kind. There are all sorts of potential uses from all over, potential interests from all over the country. But in the event, [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2006s) held the auction and the only party that turned up to the auction, surprise, surprise, was the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, who made one bid, which was simultaneously both the highest and the lowest bid, presumably, and secured the side.

All this happened very quietly. I'm not suggesting anything improper was done, nor am I suggesting that it was done properly.

So the Brethren secured the site on what I would call a “sold subject to planning permission” grounds. In other words, there was a probation time of, I think, 90 days for the Brethren to try and get the rezoning they needed. And within that period, the Brethren had the option of dropping out of the contract. So the Brethren then, with the assistance of the Council, put together a presentation to kind of sell the idea of what they were wanting to do with all the sort of plans and architectural drawings, which was, as far as I understand, first presented to the Council privately, and then it was organised that they would present it to the public in a public [meeting,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2085s) which is where Lynette comes into the picture.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2093s)

Yeah, you went to that meeting. What was it like?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2096s)

Okay, so that's the first time I've ever, like I don't go to town hall meetings in my own community really, let alone driving 40 minutes to another town. The line was, you have to wait in line, the line was around the building in this big town hall, great room sort of thing, and you all had to sign in. And then while I was waiting to get into the main room, I saw two brothers and what were they doing? They were scurrying around, they were putting out more folding chairs, they were talking to the mayor, they were just being so helpful and I was like, okay, this is typical. They know all about carrying around folding chairs.

So there was five of them, five brothers. Three of them sat back and they didn't speak, but then there was the two main speakers. They were sitting with on like a side table with laptops all set up and mics and everything with their, their like environmentalists or something. I forget what they called him. He was like, he was their spokesperson, but he was also their their civil...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2182s)

Engineer, yeah, yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2184s)

But then there was still one other person that also spoke and I never quite saw his face so I didn't, I mean, you know, I have a lot of stuff on audio that I could, he did speak, but I never saw his face so I wasn't sure exactly what he was. I mean, I think he was just there to help and so, okay, yeah. So we all sit down, the room is just packed and we all get situated and and then, I forget how who said what first, but then, well, first of all, the the lawyer spoke [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2214s) the the, the zoning commission, yeah.

And he said, this is no longer a, what was the word, like a public event. I don't know, like they weren't going to be able to vote afterwards. And they said it was a strategic move by the PBCC and they were no longer going to be able to vote at the end of this meeting. It was no longer a public meeting. And then at the very beginning when we got there, they had all the huge screens all over [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2244s) it was going to be publicized live. And so this strategic move, all that got squashed. There was nothing live, there was no voting, it was chaos.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2256s)

If I can say, I have a video that we'll dive into and then let's, we'll dissect it together.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2263s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2263s)

We'll dive into this video and then we'll, we'll stop in the places and then just have some discussion over it. So we're starting off here with Steve Johnstone describing how exclusive they are and how they'll never become a megachurch because some of the residents were worried about it becoming a megachurch. And I have to say in here, it's kind of funny because they keep digging themselves into a hole deeper and deeper.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2289s)

I'm going to say something right now because the reason they're worried about this is because in South Barrington, there is a massive, like humongous mega-church called Willow Creek. So this is where, this is why so many people are concerned about a mega-church, is because they already have one. And there's been a huge scandal around that mega-church, Willow Creek. So they don't want that. That makes sense. Okay.

### **PBCC member [Steve Johnstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2316s)**

“So our population has fluctuated within that small amount of change over the last 50 years. So now that there's been some concern that this is going to grow into a mega-church, I can assure everyone in this room that will not happen. And we have about 160 years of history to prove that to you. I think this is a very, very low-density, very nice looking project that we're proposing for this area. And I think the civil engineers can speak the technical terms as to how this will be a very low-impact to this neighborhood and we really long to become part of the fabric of this neighborhood. We long to become a neighbor…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2362s)

Okay, so I just want to pause this here and read this. So he's just talked about how they “long to become a neighbor,” and I mean...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2380s)

They'll be “low impact, and we long to become your neighbor.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2386s)

So let's just do some real quick quotes for our listeners that are listening to this and can't see the screen. So these are quotes from Bruce Hales' ministry and this is a quote:

"Of course there's a lot of damage done by young people having connections with worldly friends, terrible damage. I was talking to a young brother the other day getting into the clear. I said, where did this start? How did you get into this trouble? Oh, he said, it goes back. I said, what was it? He said, it was the boy opposite, a neighbor. And he [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2416s) for rides on his bike with him. You see, well, they should have picked that up straight away, shouldn't have they?”

 Like you stop it right there. And that's their first lie in this whole shenanigan is that they want to become your neighbor.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2430s)

It's not, I think actually the one of the reasons they want to be in Barrington is because Barrington has got a lot of those huge houses on huge lots, those McMansions, where you really can, you know, your neighbours are all hidden a long way away behind hedges and trees. It's that exclusivity that they're looking for. I think that's the draw.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2454s)

Yeah. And I mean, we all know that Brethren coming into your neighbourhood is not a low impact. They're not low-impact. That, as you saw in the video that we played earlier, right, you can see that that's not a low impact. 

### **PBCC member [Dale Diener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2489s)**

“Well, there's existing wetlands that surround the site. In this current proposed plan, we've gone through extensive efforts to model the architecture of the buildings after the, within the community. At one point a resident actually suggested we look at the clubhouse within the Regency of the Woods of South Barrington and you'll see similarities as you look at these two buildings to not only that but also to buildings off of Executive Court as well as the Village Hall. Some of the features that you'll see include dormers and gables as well as decorative of columns, stone and brick accents. And again, just really trying to keep the buildings [low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2523s) in height, as well as blend in with the surrounding architecture and complement the village and complement the community with the way they're designed.

And I think just another point as it relates to the landscaping and the building design, you know, there will be glimpses of this building, but it won't be fully obscured. So of course, you'll be able to see that the beautiful architecture as you drive by.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2545s)

This is the point that I think took all of us by surprise is that there has never been a meeting hall that we know of that looks like this. And there is no way that Chicago in South Barrington is going to be the first locality that gets a hall like this [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2576s) Australia, Sydney, Australia does.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2578s)

Yeah, I mean, it's basically, it's a huge block. It's a warehouse. It's, it's 100 feet wide, it's 170 feet long, it's nearly 40 feet tall. It's just like a huge big-box store, Walmart. They could stick some little fake gable ends and fake windows on, but it's still going to look like a warehouse. There are numerous examples. I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of rooms built all over the world and they all look essentially the same. Slight variations in finish, yes, brick and stone accents, but it's just a massive block.

### **PBCC member [Dale Johnstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2621s)**

“I emphasize here is that what we want to do is accommodate a special occasion that might happen once a year in which it would come to full capacity of a thousand members.”

### **(uproar from crowd)**

### **PBCC member [Dale Diener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2665s)**

“…various communities across the country. There are these churches that…in various cities throughout the country in which occasionally we'll get together. This is not a set timeframe or a set agenda. So we've had, how many occasions that we had in the last 10 years, Steve, historically?”

### **PBCC member [Steve Johnstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2687s)**

“Going back over the past 10 years, we helped, we hosted eight of these special events in our current facility. I will say that we don't get to choose when we host these. We always say we're open to host them. Currently Minneapolis, Detroit, Columbus, Ohio, Philadelphia, New York City has completed a new one. Another location, New Jersey, of all completed new facilities, which means our chances of hosting these is becoming less and less available. So we presented this from the very start when we brought the presentation in. I think anyone that attended the past public hearings would know [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2738s) is not a surprise that we're presenting this. This is a very special purpose-built facility.

In the past we used to rent out auditoriums for special events. But scheduling purposes and the way we host our events, that has become unworkable for us. So we are sort of a global organization and globally this is the way that we're hosting these events. Unfortunately, I'd like to say we host these more than once a year because we won't have that opportunity frankly. So travel instead of host. So hopefully that verifies…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2781s)

Let's unpack that. Let's go back to his a thousand people that come in because we know from Richard's previous video that we that we showed, it's not just going to be a thousand people. And the specially purpose-built center, it's not, these things are used every single day. And like Lynette, when you lived there, did you guys not have extended interchange when people came from all around?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2810s)

Yes, it wasn't more than once a year. Yes, like there was a time when like, I mean, this goes back years and years, but we were on a three month fellowship meeting, like we would just expect one every three months. But that was like in the early 90s when I got married. But yeah, this this talk of of this special occasion and we don't know when we're going to get it. Okay, well, that that part is true. They they don't, [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2840s) it's up to Bruce Hales when that happens. But I don't know, you just start kind of feeling like the more you watch it over, you you like Dale is being, he's not choosing to do this. You know, Dale is the younger person.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2861s)

And Steve is the older one.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2863s)

Yeah, it's like, and and it's just, you just wonder what, like why did they pick Dale? Why is Dale the one that is being chosen to be this spokesperson? Like, I don't know, they're not known for their, like they've never had any public speaking whatsoever. It shows, right? I mean, they don't, they're, it's awkward. It's awkward to watch.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2891s)

Like a deer in the headlights, yeah. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2894s)

Lots where he just like you could tell he was caught and yeah, yeah, especially when that, you know, the residents all start, you know, being angry about the thousand people, right, right.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2906s)

What would they do if they knew it was up to three thousand sometimes?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2910s)

But there's spin and there's lies and there's there's damn lies. And this is the damn lies category because Dale knows perfectly well. He's been to dozens of dozens of meetings. He's been to plenty of rooms like this. He's seen the foyer and the room crammed. He knows he's lying and he knows it's not, it's not a half-truth, it's just a complete, massive, huge lie. And he lies without a blink, without [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2940s) blush. And I mean, our generation, we were brought up, you know, I'm sure all your parents told you, you know, where liars go, liars go to hell, you know, but wow, holy cow, they're not worried about that anymore.

And this, this to me, this is Bruce Hales's legacy. This is the hallmark of the Bruce Hales administration, is that Brethren now freely and glibly lie at every possible occasion. And they get that from Bruce. It comes [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2970s) from the top.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2971s)

Yeah, yeah. Okay, so what you're about to witness next is when Sage actually comes out and asks about a public place of worship. So this was the...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=2984s)

So Sage was a resident that was given a like quite a few minutes of the floor. She had a huge presentation, and it was very well done. I wish she had been first. But anyway, she was last. And this presentation was so well done. And it was just so factual. And she had found so much information. So, yeah, Sage comes up and she, [right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3014s) off, like right away, she asks Steve, can I just ask, is this a public place of worship? And can I come to your services? Something like that, she asked.

### [**PBCC member Steve Johnstone**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3026s)

“Our website will describe that much better than I can. Anyone that desires to be part of our church there certainly is a pathway to become part of our church.”

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3040s)

“What if I'm not part of your church? For example, I go to Willow Creek, I've attended services there, I've been to the Barrington Methodist Church, been to St. Ann's, can I just come in to your church without being a member?”

 **PBCC member Steve Johnstone**

“Go to our website. It'll help you.”

### **(uproar from crowd)**

**Barrington Resident**

“The answer to that is no. You can't answer the question. I think from that, my takeaway is that the answer is no.”

### **(Applause and uproar from crowd)**

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3078s)

“I worked at zoning ordinances for other villages and they specifically say church, South Barrington specifies in every part of the ordinance that the church must be for public worship and we question how the commission can make a recommendation on the PBCC development if the church is not open for public worship.” 

### **(Applause and uproar from crowd)**

“As the village attorney knows, the rules of statutory construction require that we look at the ordinance and the plain language in the ordinance. And it very clearly says, public worship.”

### **(Applause and uproar from crowd)**

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3142s)

In 2012 when they got their charity status back, their faith and practice document says this: 

“Number one, the services of worship conducted in each Gospel Hall included in the property of the trust other than the Lord's Supper, which is Sunday morning, and services convened for a particular family or by a visiting elder, minister, servant, or evangelist for the benefit of a congregation gathering by way of special invitation, should be open to all properly disposed persons who wish to be present and observe such worship.

Properly disposed persons are members of the public, whether members of the [Brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3182s) or not, who, 1\. Respect the Gospel Hall as a sacred place, 2\. Do not threaten the safety or privacy of the assembly and 3\. Come to the service in a spirit of gravity, genuinely wishing to learn from the teachings that are given there.

Number two. We should ensure that a Gospel Hall in every locality displays prominently outside its premises a sign indicating how persons from outside the community, including former Brethren, can attend a hall for worship. 

Number three. We should offer to people [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3212s) attend our Gospel Halls for worship from outside the community including former brethren the opportunity to better understand our faith and services through literature or in person.”

So I mean, by Steve literally redirecting them to the website was his way of saying our doors are closed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3234s)

Well, I mean, to be fair, at least the website's open to the public, isn't it? So maybe that counts.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3243s)

I mean, he said, he seemed so awkward. 

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3259s)

“The next factor is the relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the adjacent properties and neighborhood. I don't see any relationship or compatibility. Again, the PBCC is not integrating or allowing for public worship or public service. There is no integration and I don't see how it fits within the neighborhood of South Barrington as a whole.

The other information they've gotten is general retail. I don't know what that means, but it's for their own community and that's fine, but it's going to do absolutely not with regards to the economic well-being of South Barrington.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3305s)

So when they're talking about general retail, let's just go and show the listeners and viewers what a Campus & Co, what a space looks like at the back.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3322s)

Yeah, so on the plan here you can see there's a building just to the where it says “proposed school store,” which is huge incidentally. You can see it's 106 feet by 67 feet, which is twice the size of any standard Campus & Co store. That's a huge, I mean you can see it's nearly as big as the school. It's a huge store and then on the right hand end of it you can see that sticking out block with an angled end and it's [got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3352s) a 65 foot driveway to it. 65 feet happens to be exactly the standard length of a of a semi-truck and so that's a that's a standard what they call a sawtooth loading dock, an angled loading dock for loading unloading semi-trailers of of groceries and goods.

So this is not, I mean in their in their literature they put out they described it either as a school store or as a gift shop. This is not [either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3382s) of those. This is a superstore plus I think at least half of the area is actually going to be warehousing, refrigerated warehousing for the other Campus & Co stores in the area. So this will be a kind of central distribution hub.

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3398s)

“The other factor is the extent to which the proposed plan will affect the property values in the vicinity. So here's a picture of the proposed development. And those individuals who reside along Shenandoah Drive, where their home backs up to Area N, or who face Area N from Shenandoah Drive, or who live on Acadia Drive, or even perhaps those now who live in Hidden Lakes because I understand from the PBCC tonight that their property will be visible from the street.

I'm not sure how you could argue that this would not depreciate the value of those surrounding homes as [President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3449s) McComney addressed in 2020, nobody wants to see a parking lot in the back at home. I'm not a broker. I'm not a real estate developer, but I know enough to know as a consumer that if I go look at home that backs up to a wetland, I might be interested in it. But if it backs up to a parking lot with harsh lighting, I may go and purchase a different…”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3472s)

Now, the next thing that happened after this is after this meeting, you guys all went home, Lynette, and things heated up. This is when we were contacted.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3483s)

Yeah. Okay. So I had brought two of my girls with me and if I'd known how long it was going to be and how late it was going to end up being, but anyways, that's besides the point. So by 10:30, like this thing started at seven and 10:30, I just realized, you know, I have work in the morning weekdays and I just knew somehow I had to leave my name and email and phone number with [Sage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3513s), the the speaker. But I mean, I was, I was in the back, Steve was over here, we had our eyes had, you know, met a couple times. It was a little bit awkward.

And before I left, I just knew I had to go up there and I had to like walk up the main aisle to where Sage was sitting because she was at the, on the end closer to the front because she was a speaker. And so [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3543s) wrote my stuff on the paper, walked up as someone, thankfully, someone, you know, someone was another resident was talking and asking questions. So I just quietly went up, folded my paper up, just kind of touched her on her shoulder and put it in her lap and I said, I don't know what I even said, just please call me or please reach out or something, I forget.

And by that point, my girls had already left, they were outside waiting for me. So I went out and [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3574s) mean, it was just like, I didn't know what to expect. So we came outside and I kind of just waited for maybe probably two minutes just to see if Sage would read it and come out and say, wait, wait, let's talk. But that was just my initial thought. So we went home and the next morning and I had an email came through, but it wasn't from Sage. It was from another girl who said, you know, I was sitting beside Sage and [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3604s) can you tell me? Please tell me more. Like we need to know what we can, what can we... I sent Cheryl, I sent you her email and it's been, we've just been full throttle ever since. It's been busy.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3623s)

So the next thing that happened was a new meeting was arranged for the residents and the council to discuss the proposal which was on a Wednesday and about three weeks after the first meeting. And on the day before that second meeting, the Brethren sneakily moved to try and close the sale, to kind of slam the door shut on it before the residents of [Barrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3654s) got a second chance to criticize or obstruct.

And we were actually on a Zoom call, the Get A Life team was on a Zoom call with the Barrington residents when an email came through to say the Brethren are trying to close ahead of the next council meeting. So that's when we all went into overdrive. And in fact, the Barrington residents managed to get their lawyer out of bed, essentially, and get the sale stopped, get a hold put on the sale, because they [realized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3688s) the Brethren were trying to shove this thing through before the residents could pull up any more objections.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3696s)

And then they got together a rally. So there was a rally that was held right before this meeting which, well that worked hard away at, you got your sign right there too. Do you have your sign?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3706s)

Sign.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3716s)

Yeah, no trespassing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3717s)

Popular sign, it was a popular sign. So I'm going to play, I'm going to play a video of the the rally and what a good turnout it was. What was supposed to be just one news station show up there ended up being like three of them and then the news article kept rolling out after that. So on the helicopter no less. Yeah, there was a helicopter, yeah.

### [**Chicago rally**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3752s)

“No PBCC\! No PBCC\! No PBCC\! No sale\! No sale\! Our voices matter\!

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3902s)

But how was that? Like that obviously, was that your first rally you've ever been to?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3906s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3907s)

And what was it like for you? What was the atmosphere?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3910s)

Well, so I'm meeting people that I've only met on Zoom and emails and I was surprised at the turnout and I was surprised that at the, like when stuff happens where I live, I guess I just kind of like, whatever, someone will take care of it, you know, I don't really get too involved. But I need to be after seeing how fired up these residents are. It is making me feel more like, I, this is my community, I need to do something, you know, I need to do stuff.

So it was, it was just, all these people with all these signs and all these kids, all [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3955s) moms, it was so many mothers and don't mess with the mothers. So it was just a different sort of experience, I guess. I don't know how else to describe it. It was just there was a lot of people there. But would it have been nice to have that many more again? Probably. So when you're in a rally, I don't know how rallies work, but like it's hard to keep yelling the whole time. Like my throat got sore, other people's throat, I mean not, so you're just not yelling constantly. You're just like, picture taken or maybe, so then you start [yelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=3992s) some more. But I mean, we yelled a lot. I mean, it was, no alcohol in our elementary schools or something, no alcohol in elementary schools, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4003s)

Let's unpack that for the viewers. Let's explain to them what that means. That I mean, the alcohol isn't sitting in the elementary classes, but Campus & Co, the store, has a liquor store that is inside and part of that building.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4019s)

Yeah, so that's that's where the, that's where that chant came from. This is what has got so many people enraged, that is that alcohol first of all is just so used so open, like it's just used so much around children. And I was glad I went even though I was, even though I didn't want to, I went and then it was a good feeling to to show support to people that I have never known existed. I mean, you know, like you didn't know them, but then you realize that the people that I once was is encroaching on these people's life, like their entire livelihood. They're just going to like, and I was like, I can't, I can't let this happen if I can help it. So...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4075s)

Yeah. One thing that was very noticeable, probably would have been a bit of culture shock to years of course in the Brethren, the women are not allowed to speak at all. And so to see all these women shouting and chanting, getting vocal and answering Steve back and putting him in his place, no wonder the poor guy was terrified. It had never been spoken to like that by a woman before.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4100s)

No.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4100s)

I mean, and it's this sort of level of misogyny that we got so used to as to not even think about it. But then when you get out into the real world and you hear these women who will stand up and use their voice and make their point and just wipe the floor with the guys.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4117s)

I think that was confusing for them. They don't have a rebuttal to that. They just don't even know what to do with a woman who speaks her mind. It's just not allowed.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4130s)

Yeah. They never even realized women had minds before, and they're kind of having to adjust rather quickly, aren't they?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4137s)

And if we go back and touch on the subject about alcohol within the Brethren for those that are watching this that haven't gone and sifted through all of our podcasts, alcohol is something that is very widely used in there at a very young age. We have teachers that have spoken out about finding alcohol inside kids' water bottles inside schools. So when you bring a school into your neighborhood, that brings in a whole whack of problems that include alcoholism, drunk driving, fatal car crashes. There's many articles on those. There's a lot of history that's been provided with that issue.

So I think for myself, that was what my whole goal was with this, is what I, you want to keep another community safe from those types of things that are happening because they have not fixed the alcohol problem within there. In my opinion, I honestly think that the Brethren need to find a piece of [land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4195s) somewhere out in some country and have their own community away from everybody else if they're not willing to change their issues and look at their issues and deal with them, including the pedophilia, their alcohol, the car crashes, drunk driving, all those types of things, right?

So, but they won't. No, they won't, right? And so I think that's what, and that's what for coming from our angle, that's what we were trying to keep another community clear and clean of the issues that tend to follow [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4225s) PBCC coming into our neighborhood, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4229s)

So are you shocked at the level of deceit? Like, you know it's there, and you can see it once you get out of it, but watching it play out on the screen, was that shocking? It was like...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4243s)

I guess, yes, I was also in a place because I know Steve. I like Steve. Steve was a nice guy. You know, I never had any issues with Steve. But to hear him in a public setting lying through his teeth, it's a bit of a, like, it's like, I'm thankful I'm out, but why didn't I see it? You start asking yourself, why didn't I see it sooner? Or stop that cycle and just be, I'm thankful I'm out. I'm thankful I'm away from that. And I'm just sorry. I'm sorry for these people. Like they are so, so indoctrinated and so brainwashed that they will sit there in a room full of, I don't know how many people were in that first night. Every single one was opposing them.

And he can sit there with a straight face and not even, not even apologize. Like, I'm sorry that you guys don't want us. Like, like there was nothing like that. It was just like, you don't like us, well, we're gonna dig in our heels and we're gonna make sure we get here then. Like it was almost like a, oh, watch us, we're gonna, it was almost...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4325s)

It was just arrogant, arrogant, very arrogant.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4329s)

Very arrogant. Very good, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4331s)

The thing I find shocking is that a public meeting like that with the council present is almost the same as being in court. It's public testimony. Yes. I mean, they didn't actually have to affirm or put their hand on the Bible. But in that situation, society has an expectation that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It's very close to perjury, what they're doing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4358s)

Yeah. Yeah, and the thing is if they had just sat there and just told the truth of like why they are not a public place of worship, like if they as time goes on and as we show you more of these videos, they just keep digging themselves a deeper and deeper and deeper hole by the amount of lies that they're telling. If they had just come clean, if you just come clean right at the beginning, tell the truth, get it out, then it's not, it's not going to look the way that it was looking. Yeah, we were...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4385s)

Talking, they're like Steve talking like that, he's talking to the people that don't know. Okay, so I'm there, I'm taking video, I know that he's lying. Other people don't know he's lying, right? So that's why this works, because it works. It works until it doesn't.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4407s)

Yes, and of course people would expect a church, a Christian group of all things to be the most honest. I mean, they would never suspect that a church leader is going to come in and lie through his teeth to them, are they? I mean, that's the other reason it works. What better cover for criminality than to be a very respectable mainstream Christian church?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4430s)

Except they're not.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4432s)

I was a witness when they got married.And he was, yeah, he was the nicest guy. Like to see him there lying through his teeth, I mean, he's changed so much. He was an outgoing, really funny, nice guy. And seeing him with that poker face, he never had a good line poker, poker face in the first place. And looking at him there, he's just like ready to jump out of his skin because a piece of him knows he's not being honest. You know, you look on the Plymouth Brethren site and expect it's going to tell you [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4470s) different than what you know. He knows very good and well that it's not a public place of worship, so why hide behind something like that that's just silly.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4478s)

Well, because they don't know their own answers, right? So they're probably given a few, answer this for this, or you might get this question, but he looked like the deer in the headlights when he did not know how to respond. And and I mean, a little part of me did have empathy because I was like, who is putting Steve in this place like this? I don't think Steve wants to be here. I mean, I can't speak for him, but the person, like who is dangling all these people like little marionette? Like it's not fair.

The the person, the person that is doing all this in each locality, I think I know who it is in Chicago, but I'm not going to say, but they're getting younger and younger, these priests, these young, these young men that are taking the lead. Why wasn't he there? You know, why why put someone else there that that has to answer for you? That's that's where I'm... that's what I don't like.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4542s)

Well, and they're really not doing themselves any favors by separating themselves so far away from, from, well, they call it the world. They have no social skills and keeping themselves separate in their own little environment. They're restricting what they're allowed to learn. They have no practice in speaking in front of insubmissive women, if you want to call it that. They literally can't function in the world outside their own community. And this is [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4572s) generation outside of public schools. Imagine what it's going to be when you get second generation outside of public schools. If this generation can't even function in a community meeting that has outspoken women in it, what is the next generation going to do? Are they going to hide of the tables? I mean, really, we're in shock.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4595s)

They're taught their arrogance though. They're taught that arrogance, right? Because they're taught that they're in this special place. It's entitlement. Yes, their arrogance and entitlement and their ego is what is going to bring them down. Yeah, because they believe, they firmly believe that they could sit there in that room and lie and say what they needed to say to be able to get what they wanted, right? Yeah, like it's like a toddler or a teenager lying through their teeth to get what they want. They know how to maneuver the system. That [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4625s) what a lot, I think that's the biggest thing that the listeners and viewers need to understand when you're up against a situation like this is that you need to make sure you're doing your fact checking.

I mean, yeah, there's 65 podcasts, go watch them. You're going to find a lot information in them and it's, you'll understand that who you're dealing with is not who you're dealing with, right? 

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4652s)

Yeah, the Chicago, the Chicago Tribune freelance videographer, the camera person, we all followed her in and I don't know where all that video is, but we we followed her in and we all sat down and then it was just the the Park District board, like it was none of the zoning, none of the town, like it was just the Park District and they did not [speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4683s). They just, they were petulant, indifferent. I don't, they just said that since, I mean, I have it on video, but something to the effect like, you guys are, we're under litigation or something like that, we can't, we can't speak. So...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4702s)

Okay, I'm going to share this video of them that that happened in there and yeah, we'll go and...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4709s)

Perhaps just, just before you go on the video, the the two main people on the parks board are Pete Peresin and, what's her name, Shelby Elias. These are the the president and vice president respectively of the board. They're the ones responsible for selling the site and they are also local realtors.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4734s)

Which means something, I think.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4739s)

Which means a lot, as we will get to later.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4742s)

Yeah.

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4743s)

“...but you're our neighbors, you're our community members, you're elected volunteer officials, we all appreciate what you're doing. However, I don't think any of you want to be known as pariahs in your own community. I'm sure you don't want that. So it's fairly obvious how your community thinks and it's very obvious that you're not representing those who put you there. I know you're standing behind what your attorney is telling you. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4773s) know that there are lawsuits on either side. Frankly, it comes down to this, right?

You may have a lawsuit from the real estate contract, or you might have a much bigger problem on your hand when you're going against your own community where you're gonna be known as a pariah in your community. So you have a decision to make, right? Which way do you wanna go? But it's very clear how the community feels, and if you feel that you can disregard the community and have them support you, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4803s) know, I think every single person here, if you wanted to put up a referendum or raise the bond money to help the South Barrington Park District would agree to do that. Every single one of us would write a check to help the Park District. There's no doubt. But the way we're going about it in which to raise funds to the shady backroom deal where obviously there's collusion, that will not stand and nobody here is going to stand for that.”

### [**Second**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4829s) **[Barrington Resident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4743s)**

It's incredibly obvious that Shelby, Peter, I don't know your name, pardon Mr. Lawyer, Scott, what's your name? Kyle. It's obvious that you don't care what you think. And based on your face Shelby, it looks like you're disgusted to sit here to listen to this because you can do whatever you want and you don't have to listen to us. Well guess what? We filed a lawsuit and you're going to have to listen to that.

The Park District held a single buyer's hand over a year to voters without the voters even having a chance to approve the sale. The Park District intentionally suppressed votes by sending mailers only to a portion of South Barrington residents when they're supposed to represent all residents. This land has been vacant for 21 years and is zoned for parks and recreation. Residents want to see the land conserved and used for public benefit.

The Park District lied to voters that a yes vote would increase tax revenue, not my words, the Park District's words, and avoid a tax increase, both of which are not true for the nonprofit entity that they were trying to sell to will not pay taxes. We were going to [chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4930s) on Wednesday morning prior to this meeting to talk about our opposition. But guess what? Sneakily, all of a sudden, there was a closing scheduled for Tuesday, which is, according to my calendar, is before Wednesday. Okay, so guess what I had to do? I had to go call my attorney and find out what Chicago Title office and what time the closing was, which, by [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=4960s) way, for all the smart people in the room, isn't hard to find out.

So then we finally confirmed that it was the day before we were meeting. So what were we going to do? Were we going to sit here and let the sale close? No\! We had our attorney work until 2:50 in the morning drafting up an injunction in a case on the property of the sale. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. Because this is what I like. What I like is depositions. What I like is asking every single one of you people under oath in a law firm, according to exactly everything that's going to come out, the PBCC members are also going to be deposed, and we're going to find out exactly what's happening. You have no idea [who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5019s) you're dealing with, obviously. Okay?

Because these little …(loud applause)... are not going to happen. So, buckle up, because we just got started.

### [**Third Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5037s)

...elected you. And it is a true disappointment how you have no transparency for your constituents. And I have to say, after 15 years of living here, I will definitely make it my mission to make sure you are not elected in the next election. You do not represent us. How are you sure? We are the public. You represent us. And you are not representing [us.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5067s) Thank you.

After everything Steve said at the last meeting, which you really got so many points, it seems almost illegal at this point that you are even contemplating going through with this. Steve, I really appreciate him if there's any help needed in a lawsuit. I mean, I'm sure we will all be happy to kick in to help with expenses on that. I was ready to hire you, too, after the last meeting because she's proved that this does not benefit our community at all.

I, you know, don't understand why even if the sale went through, it would still have to go through zoning, which according to all the South Barrington laws and PDs they were called or whatever, it doesn't even fit. You know, you can't change all these laws to [make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5113s) something fit. So I don't understand where the common sense is in any of this. I'm sorry to park this because it's so out of money. You've obviously mismanaged funds for a long time, but that shouldn't be our problem. It's not going to help us. You are in debt. Find another way to pay it off. This sale cannot happen.

And we will make sure it doesn't happen because even if you approve this, even if it goes through, the zoning will not work, the lawsuits, we will make sure it doesn't happen. This is very underhanded, this is [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5143s) shady the way you're operating. They are gonna build walls around us. We can do a lot better with this land, but we have a lot of people that have offered to do better with that land. We will not stand for this\! And even if we don't do anything with this land, it would be better than having what, where you guys have signed the deal with the devil to do to our beautiful town. And it's got to stop. It cannot happen. We will make sure this does not happen, right?

**Fourth Barrington Residen**t

My family doesn't see me because of this. Because we're here. Why are we here? Answer that question for us at some point, please. I know right now you're not going to say anything. You're under litigation, all of that stuff. But this is, it's disappointing. It's frustrating. It's a waste of time really. We just like, we shouldn't even be here. This should have been dissolved when you heard our opposition the first time when we came to our participatory last month. It should have been dissolved.

President of the Commission and you didn't even ask for a vote from your own group and half of whom aren't even here. I'm not sure what forum we're talking about. Yeah, just lots of disappointment and frustration and this will figure out how important.

**Fifth Barrington Resident**

 I am the closest house to Area N and I am extremely disappointed with this entire situation. I think I voiced my concerns to you as well as the village in every single meeting. The fact that we would, we never got a postcard about this is ridiculous. I live at Area N. I'm within 100 feet of Area N. So along with my community, I oppose the sale.

With all of this uproar, I can't believe that you wanted to move up the closing and you accepted that on Monday, Tuesday, whenever it was. But I think that's a big awakening call for who's on the board right now. I think when your term is up, I think you're going to have an entirely new board. Yes. And I think you're going to have a lot of individuals back here running. 

**Sixth Barrington Resident**

Residents, is there anyone else here? We all live in this town. There's no reason for this type of angst from people. People feel as if there's a side deal going on. And when you don't govern with full disclosure, then people are going to have that conclusion. And I don't think you all want that type of reputation [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5311s) this town. Thank you very much.

**Seventh Barrington Resident**

We still haven't gotten answers of why a big portion of our community was not included on the postcard mailing for the referendum. To me, that's trying to protect and hide the problem from our community. Second of all, if this is going to be such a great thing for our community, where's all the supporters?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5341s)

After watching all that, I mean, you can really tell how riled up those residents are and it is true. It is true. There is no public benefit the people will bring into that neighborhood. There'll be no public benefit.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5360s)

Right, just re-watching those videos. So what most people, like everyone's upset, but there's, so that one tall woman, her name's Ashley, she was it, she was in the blue scrubs, her house is the first house at Area N. Like the first house, like would be like the probably the driveway to the meeting room or whatever or into the land or whatever. She never got a postcard. So this is what this whole postcard thing, I learned a lot about [politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5390s) and stuff in the last little bit here.

But so there was a referendum, a referendum that went out, I think it was in April or May in South Barrington and it had a very vague, it was very vague. It said, do you want an upgrade to the parks, something on that, do you want, do you want the parks upgraded, vote yes or no? Most people want the parks upgraded, so they voted yes. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5421s) in the first meeting that I was at, and I was actually videoing Ashley that time too, she said she voted no, I think, I think she said she voted no, I should, because it was...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5431s)

The question on the referendum referendum was should they auction off Area N so they had the money to upgrade the parks? So the question was around whether they could auction that land off or not, but they kind of sneakily made out that if they sold the land, that would give them the money to upgrade the parks and then they also wouldn't have to raise taxes. Is that right?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5461s)

It, well, there's been three different referendums. So this last one that just happened in April or May, it was very, very vague and it just said, do you want, I wish I had, I had paper, I had on notes, but I couldn't find them. They were just scribbled because I wrote down what actually said, do you, do you want the parks upgraded, vote yes or no? It was like something vague like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5487s)

Yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5487s)

And without, without the residents knowing, the Brethren had already, there was already stuff going on with the Brethren. Even though they were having this referendum, the Brethren were already interested in this land. Things were already moving along. And another thing, if you hear those, a lot of the people talking in those videos, so many are angry because of the the deceit by the Park District where they did not send everyone a [flyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5518s). So these people didn't even get a flyer about the Area N, like the people that were closest to this land didn't get this important postcard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5529s)

Okay, so they didn't even know what they were voting for.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5532s)

Yeah, it was just so, so deceitful.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5534s)

And this is where I think so many people have gone off with backdoor dealings and how this is all happening where you can start drawing, connecting the dots of why would, why would those people be so secretive and getting this deal through right up to the last minute of trying to get it through on Tuesday when they were supposed to be meeting Wednesday? Why would they do all this with the Brethren if there wasn't something in it for them, right? So this is where it takes us to us putting and connecting dots of like, perhaps we have two people that are on the board that are realtors.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5576s)

Okay, so this is Shelby Elias, she's the vice president of the Park District and she is a realtor with Compass, which is a big national real estate chain. And this is Pete Perisin, who's the president of the Park District and he's a realtor with Coldwell Banker Realty. And they both, you know, they're both dealing real estate in the Barrington, in the Chicago area. And they also both have second businesses. Pete owns a landscaping business that does the kind of fancy gardens and landscapes around the McMansions in the area and Shelby has a [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5622s) of a home upgrade and home development business.

So they're both in realty and they also on the side have businesses upgrading and developing new sites, upgrading homes and doing all the landscaping and the gardening. Now, the significance of this is that when the Brethren move to a new area, they all move. Each congregation is supposed to stay within, at the very most, a 10-mile radius of their central hub, their city meeting hall, which is what this new Barrington development is intended to be. It'll be the new meeting hall for the whole Chicago congregation. Everyone is supposed to live within walking distance of a meeting hall. And, of course, they have smaller local meeting halls [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5678s) will be in the immediate area around the main hall.

But the total kind of catchment area that they have to fit into is not going to be more than 20 miles in diameter. And because their present city meeting room is way down south of O'Hare Airport, and it's like 30 minutes away by car, it's well over 10 miles away. I think it's 20, 26 miles by road. [Basically,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5708s) almost all the current Chicago congregation would move into the Barrington area if they went ahead with this development. And that's 60, 65 households or so. So that means 65 good-sized detached houses will go on the market and be sold. 65 good-sized, even more expensive detached houses will [be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5738s) bought, all in the space of maybe two or three years, all in the immediate area of Barrington or the adjacent area of Chicago down towards the airport, which is a huge windfall for any realtor.

I mean even if there wasn't actually a side deal, even if there wasn't an agreement that yes, Pete Perisin and Shelby Elias will get the lion's share of the business, it would still be a huge windfall for the realtors in the area [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5768s) it's a huge number of people suddenly moving in to their patch. But the way it normally works, I mean, in the Brethren, it tends to be that all the Brethren in one congregation will use the same realtor because Brethren have very specific requirements about the homes that have to be detached. They can't have shared drains, this, that, and the next thing. And so just by kind of a natural process of recommendation, the Brethren will typically all use the same realty company.

In a situation like this, nothing would be easier or more natural than [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5805s) Steve and Dale to have said to Pete and Shelby, look, there's going to be a whole lot of households moving into the area. If you can kind of make this all go through smoothly to us, we can put a huge amount of real estate business your way. And if you do some very rough calculations, let's assume 60 households move, for each of those households they've got to sell and then they've got to buy again. [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5835s) average value of their houses, and Brethren have big detached houses, they've got lots of kids, they like big houses. I'm saying on average maybe $800,000 a house. So that's like 120, 130 real estate deals each of about three quarters of a million dollars.

And the realtors will take maybe conservatively 3% on each deal. That gives you between, I think the figure is between $7 and $8 million to share between Shelby and Pete. It's a huge windfall. And as I said, even if there wasn't a kind of a wink and a nod that the business would be pushed their way, being the local realtors, they're still going to pick up a healthy chunk of that business. So [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5890s) very likely, in my opinion, knowing the way Brethren work, that there was an agreement that Pete and Shelby would get the lion's share of the Brethren's real estate business when they all move into Barrington.

And even if there wasn't any such agreement, there's a very, very definite conflict of interest between the personal interest of these two realtors and the best interest of the people of Barrington. Because there was a number of possible things they [could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5920s) have done with this site. They could have just retained it as a sort of a wild park nature reserve. It could have been developed with, say, a dozen big residential houses. It could have been turned into a school or some public facility, all of which would have been essentially beneficial to the area because even if it's residential housing, all those houses pay property tax to the council, which increases the revenues. But they [chose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5950s) and carefully steered and manoeuvred and manipulated to make sure that the site goes to the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, who will completely fence the whole site off with security fencing, will introduce a huge amount of traffic to the area and will pay no taxes at all. So it's the worst possible option for the residents of Barrington that they claim to represent.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5974s)

But it's... They're fighting for it so hard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5977s)

Yes, exactly. They're fighting for it so hard.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5980s)

It doesn't make sense.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5981s)

It doesn't make sense until you realize that they're realtors and they will get a huge windfall, millions and millions of dollars each, if this thing goes through.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5991s)

And we are not saying that Councilors Perisin and Elias or the PBCC have engaged in any criminal or unethical activity in this matter.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=5999s)

There's also, we should mention there's a GoFundMe going on for their legal fees.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6003s)

Yes, there is. Yeah, I'll add for the residents.I’ll add it into the description for that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6007s)

So after when the rally happened and the meeting happened, out came all of the newspaper articles and I'm going to take, I will put links to all the newspaper articles in the description of this podcast, but we're going to take a quick journey through them. So this is the Barrington Hills Observer. And so when you see this, there is a QR code here that takes you to a petition through change.org that if anybody's been following this on Facebook or [social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6037s) media, we have been avidly trying to share this. So make sure you go to change.org. I'll also attach the link in the description and make sure you sign this petition. You don't need to live here to sign this petition. Feel free, please sign this petition and help this community out. So I'm just going to go through some of these. Here's another Barrington Hills Observer.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6058s)

Yeah, so just reading the headlines, this one is, 

“Nearby South Barrington Park District property sale concerns neighbors.”

 So that was August the 4th. So that was a very early one before this really blew up. People were already concerned about it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6076s)

Yeah, and this is August 18th,

“ Hearing on controversial church plan canceled in South Barrington, but opponents still have their say.”

 So that happened the night that that came out the next day after the, the first, the first meeting. Yeah, I might not have these in, in, I might not have these in...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6095s)

Oh, there, there's Ashley. That's Ashley, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6098s)

Yeah, yeah, I should post that. So this is August 31st. I just brought up all the Barrington Hills Observer ones. 

“This is why the South Barrington Park District has halted land sale to church to church part two.”

 And so this Ashley in the blue scrubs you saw earlier in her plea for, she's the one that lives 100 feet away from Area N. Um, and here's another, why South Barrington Park District has halted land sale to church, so part one and part two. And this is the Chicago Tribune. So this is the article from the rally that was done.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6137s)

And there, I think holding up the PBCC sign with a slash across it is our local representative, Lynette.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6144s)

Yeah, and I didn't make that sign. I don't know. I was just had, people were just handing me signs. So we were all, you know, never knew I'd be in a newspaper on the news. Well, there I am.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6159s)

Again, the Daily Herald, “

Why the South Barrington Park District has halted land sale at the church.”  
 Uh, here we have Lynette in the background here.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6167s)

It's like, where, it's like, where's Wally, isn't it? You have to look for the orange cardigan.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6171s)

Well, right there I'm talking to Courtney, the girl that I've been talking to the most.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6177s)

Yep. Yeah, she's the one that's been emailing us back and forth. And you know, it's funny, these blue signs that these people are are holding actually have ministry quotes on them. Yes. Um, so and this is again, Chicago 5 News,  
“ Church hoping to move into South Barrington faces pushback from residents.” 

We'll play the news that was on the channel there.

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6200s)

“Happening tonight, some community pushback in South Barrington over plans to build a church. NBC5's Natalie Martinez reports some residents say they feel deceived about the plans. Dozens of South Barrington residents are upset tonight. They say they feel deceived and not heard.”

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6223s)

“People feel as if there's a side deal going on.”

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6227s)

“At tonight's Park District board meeting, dozens argue that the district focused on a single buyer for the 35-acre plot of land near Route 59 and West Bartlett Road.”

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6233s)

“They purchased this land for $3 million in 2004\. They're looking to sell it now for $1.7 million.”

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6244s)

“They say the village and the Park District helped Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, PBCC, through approval.”

### [**Barrington Resident**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6249s)

“I believe there's some hand-holding there that residents were not aware of, and when we were asked to vote on this matter, we were not provided the complete picture. The Park District intentionally suppressed votes by sending mailers only to a portion of South Barrington residents.”

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6267s)

“On Tuesday, the group tells us in an effort to stop a closing yesterday, they abruptly filed a complaint in Cook County for a hearing on a TRO for September 5th. The Park District says it was planning to answer questions about misinformation, but…”

### [**Shelby Elias**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6281s)

“…because of the pending litigation, we are no longer allowed to do that.”

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6286s)

“Local PBCC members speaking on behalf of the group tell us by phone that the global organization is trying to build a meeting hall and school for about 200 people. They say they would open its doors to all, work with, and hire neighbors, even making alterations to change access plans off residential streets.”

### **PBCC member [Russell McAbery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6302s)**

“We've been around in the Chicago area for over 100 years. It's a very small, small group that's going to be moving there on a regular basis. We feel very little impact will be noticed by the neighbours.”

### [**Chicago News**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6312s)

“The village director told me, no action tonight, but hopefully in the near future. In South Barrington, Natalie Martinez, NBC5 News. Our thanks to Natalie.”

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6321s)

Again, we hear blatant lies from Russell McAbery to get what they want. They do not open their doors to all, and they will not be hiring any outsiders to work at their retail slash Campus\&Co. This is the Roy's Report. They did an excellent job on this too.

“ Protests and claims of abuse halts Chicago area land deal of Plymouth Brethren Church.”

 There's Lynette's sign again. And then this is;

 “A controversial land sale heads to court.”

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6355s)

It’s a podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6356s)

Yeah, so it's kind of like a little podcast and it has Russell from the Daily Herald is in here talking about this. So in this article, where it was introduced, this spokesperson, Jacqueline Wilcox, and we're going to share an altered news article of where they wipe her name clean because we brought out what she was.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6388s)

That's not the first time they've tried altering news, is it?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6391s)

No, it's not. Okay, so this is the Daily Herald that I just showed you previously on that was a post on Facebook. And we went back today to get the information for our podcast and realized that the article had changed. So yeah, go ahead Richard and explain what we're seeing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6410s)

Yeah, so I'll I'll read it out. So this is Daily Herald:

“Local critics of the plan have said they're concerned about the ecological impact of the proposed development, the conversion of the land into private property, traffic and other issues. Some have criticised the church's practices too. Plymouth Brethren Christian Church members follow a doctrine of separation and don't socialise with non-members. 

“The church is reviewing the decision to halt the sale.”

 [Spokeswoman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6440s) Jacqueline Wilcox said via email Wednesday.;

"The church's plans for the land have been developed with a deep consideration and commitment to the environmental sensitivities of the site as well as the fabric of the neighbourhood," 

Wilcox said. In an earlier email, Wilcox noted the church already has removed from the plan a proposed access road from Acadia Drive within the woods of South Barrington because of the community's concerns.”

 So [that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6470s) the original article published the day after the meeting on August 31st or the day of the meeting.

Now when we went back to the article to pull it up for the podcast, we realized that Jacqueline Wilcox had disappeared. So we pulled up on Wayback Machine the original and we pulled up the new article and put them side by side. And now in the new article, where the old article says,

 "The church is reviewing to halt is reviewing the decision to halt the sale, spokeswoman Jacqueline Wilcox said via email."

 [The](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6508s) new article just says, 

"The church is reviewing the decision to halt the sale."

And in the next paragraph it talks about deep sensitivity to the environment and so on and the original article ends,

 "Wilcox said." 

The new article, there's nothing at the end of it. It's just;

“... according to a statement that the church sent. “

And then in the old article, the original article, the next paragraph starts, 

"...in an earlier email, Wilcox noted…" 

The new article, it's just 

"...in an earlier email, the church…."

 So Wilcox has been, and I mean, Daily Herald is a big newspaper. It's not easy to push their journalists around. But the Brethren have somehow managed to [persuade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6561s) the newspaper to airbrush out Jacqueline Wilcox as their spokeswoman.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6570s)

I wonder if she's still their spokeswoman.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6572s)

Well, yes. I mean, this must be the record shortest lifetime ever for a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church spokeswoman. In fact, I suspect she's the only spokeswoman the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have ever had, and she lasted all of 24 hours. And there's two possible reasons for this. One is that, of course, the Brethren take very literally Paul's injunction that women are to [remain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6603s) quiet and not to speak or exercise authority. So the thought of, to a traditional member of the Plymouth Brethren, the thought of having a spokeswoman is is some kind of taboo or anathema.

So that probably didn't go down, but even, actually I forget who it was, it was one of the contributors on the Facebook site pointed out that Jacqueline Wilcox under her previous name of Jacqueline Bailey had written a book called 

“C[onversations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6634s) in a Brothel, men tell why they do it.” 

And she's plastered this this exciting fact all over her website. So you then have the the prospect of the Plymouth Brethren spokeswoman, the representative of God's chosen people is not only a woman but a woman that has conversations with men in a brothel, which leads you to speculate how she came to know the Brethren at all.

 But apparently she no longer exists and she's all history and she's been replaced by Russell McAbery who's a very ordinary and boring brother from Chicago.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6676s)

Did you say Russell was excommunicated?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6679s)

No, no, no, I meant that woman.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6681s)

Oh yeah, she's been wiped from the pages of the history book. Yeah.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6687s)

Russell, Russell was at that first meeting.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6689s)

Okay.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6691s)

He sat in the back.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6693s)

But here's what I want to get across is how like the pull the Brethren have with people. The pull they've had on the Barrington Park District and now like in this news article where they can just phone up and say, hey, we need you to take out this lady's name. Yeah, it's just, I think it's important to notice exactly, it's important you notice the pull that they do have and the the ties that they do have to people in order to get stuff done.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6722s)

Is it, is it the pull or is it maybe bullying or bribery or like, or why would...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6729s)

All of the above. I guess that's all we can assume, yeah, exactly, from our experiences and what we've known in everything that we've experienced. Yeah, all of the above most likely.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6740s)

Well, the situation as it is at the moment is that the sale has been put on hold by a legal action which the Park District and the Brethren are contesting. They've hired some very highfalutin lawyer that specialises in religious freedom and in making sure that religions are not discriminated against. So that suggests that they're going to go for the kind of “poor me,” religious discrimination, everyone's being horrid to us because we're Christians [kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6770s) of approach.

The residents, as you've obviously seen, are very fired up and very motivated and they have their own lawyers. So this now turns into a legal battle and it's going to be very, very interesting to watch what happens, particularly as the facts around the huge benefits to the realtors, who are also the commissioners, as that becomes public, it's going to stir up a lot more [outrage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6807s) and they're going to have some very, very difficult explanations to make. There's a couple of different ways this could go.

It may well be the Brethren have actually given up on the idea of using this site for a meeting hall because as one of the residents commented, they'll never get it through the zoning with having the residents on their side. What I suspect is happening now is that they've got a contract to buy this site at a ridiculously cheap price. Remember, this site was originally worth more than 3 million and they've got it for about 1.75. I think what the Brethren are planning on doing is buying the site, securing some planning permission on it probably for residential use and then flipping it at a huge profit. I mean, they're probably going to make a million [dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6860s) on it, which, of course, would be even more infuriating for the residents of Barrington because, of course, the council could and should have done that on their behalf.

So it may be that the Brethren are going to keep fighting for their meeting hall, kind of on principle, because they're stupid. It may be they just want to make a fast buck. But all this is still happening. It's all live, we're all very much involved and we'll keep you updated.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6889s)

I want to have one last conversation on freedom of religion. That this was on my list to do today. You know what, I am all for freedom of religion. I am all for freedom of religion. Everybody should have the choice to practice their own religious views, whatever those may be. But I think we're coming to a time in society where we need to define what that is. Because to me, freedom of religion should not [harm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6919s) another human being. And the PBCC and their practices that they do causes harm to not only those that are in there but out there and other community members because of their practices that they do not fix.

So my question to everybody listening and watching this is, what do you think are the problems with society's cliche statement and response [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6950s) freedom of religion, that we should have freedom of religion? There needs to be laws and regulations within that. And so comment below what you think is wrong with the statement and the belief of practicing freedom of religion. Also to everybody, please make sure you comment, subscribe and like. That helps our algorithm and it also increases our traffic flow on here. So please, please, please comment and like below and we will keep you [updated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6980s) on as this progresses. Do you have anything else to add?

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=6985s)

I don't know. I guess I can say I've been on a podcast before now. I've been on a podcast and I'm no longer lurking in the silence and doing things behind the scenes. I'm an outright opposer now. 

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7005s)

Welcome to the club. Lynette's been a rock for me. She's been my, like, leaning boards when I fall. So...

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7010s)

I've been doing a lot behind the scenes, but now I'm out in the open.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7015s)

And we're very, very grateful for you driving all that weight, spending all those hours, sending me all the videos while you're there and me sending them to Richard while he's on James's podcast and it was quite the teamwork we had going that it was domino effect. Yeah, we're very, very grateful for you coming on and sharing a bit about your own personal story and I am sure we'll see you again as this unfolds. Yeah, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you, thank [you,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7045s) Lynette. Thank you, bye.

We've added an updated video from survivors of the PBCC as a harsh reminder of the mess they leave behind.

### [**Ailsa Schlaudraff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7087s)

Hi, my name is Ailsa Schlaudraff. I was abused by my ex-husband in the PBCC for 16 years. Three and a half years ago, I escaped with my daughter. After I left, the priests told me that because in their view my daughter belonged to the church and not to me, they would fight me for custody for as long as it took. Three and a half years later, I have full power of attorney over my daughter. And my ex-husband has been convicted of child abuse. And yet he remains protected, supported and cared for in the PBCC. And I'm shunned.

### [**Abi Thompson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7123s)

Hi, my name's Abi. I'm a recent leaver of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church slash exclusive Brethren, who also run a charity called RRC. The Brethren were anything but charitable towards me. I suffered many abuses inside the PBCC. I'm a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and since leaving, I'm completely cut off from all family and all friends.

Then when I was 16 years old they tried to force me to marry a 28 year old man from India. After I left the Brethren I had secret contact with my parents. After my father died the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church told my dementia suffering mother that they were taking her on holiday. They took her to Australia and kept her there until [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7318s) passed away. This was against her express wish to return to her UK home.

My name is Richard. I'm a former member of the Brethren who became a whistleblower reporting on financial fraud to the authorities and on their cruel treatment of former members to journalists. In a desperate attempt to silence me, the Brethren hired a ruthless team of private investigators and lawyers. We had private investigators outside our house for a month who would follow my wife down the street and even on public transport. As a result, we've had [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7395s) move into hiding.

### [**Dr Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7494s)

Hello, my name is Richard Marsh. When I was a teenager in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, I could not accept their ever more extreme rules and edicts on separation from the world. I didn't believe it to be an egregious sin to share a cup of tea with a local vicar, but they did. Because of this I was excommunicated and expelled from my home to a very cold caravan in a field outside Cambridge. That was over 60 years ago now and I've not been permitted to see any of my large family since. Just recently they deliberately chose not to tell me of the deaths of my two brothers to make sure I did not attend their funerals.

### [**Rowan Scott**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7534s)

My name's Rowan Scott. I asked to attend my mother's funeral in the PBCC. It was refused.

### [**Lynette Diener**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7541s)

My name's Lynette. I chose to lead the Exclusive Brethren, also known as the PBCC, over what I believe was the idolatry of a man, false teachings of the Bible and also the way my family was treated by the Brethren growing up.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7557s)

### [**Ken Wallace**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7569s)

Hi, I am Ken Wallace. I left Dalwallinu, Western Australia in 1998 and the PBCC because they held clearly and witnessed to the fact that the Lord had no issue with liars. I disagreed, withdrew from them. 25 years later, I enjoyed freedom with most of my family and I won't stop trying to get the rest of my family out of that evil, disruptive cult.

### [**Peter Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7599s)

Hi, I'm Peter. Three years ago, I asked the Brethren questions about why they weren't litigating ex-members and about the leaders' conduct. I was excommunicated for this. My wife and children chose to stay with the Brethren because of fear of leaving and I have no contact with them at all.

### [**Jill Mytton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4nHYugnso&t=7621s)

I'm Jill Mytton, a counselling psychologist, researcher and former member of the Brethren. I left at the age of 16 when my parents decided to leave. I lost my brother and several other close family members. Over the last 30 years, I've been researching the well-being of former members and I've found evidence that support the stories told in this video. Stories of sexual abuse, of trauma, of depression, anxiety, tales of loss and grief, harm and detriment. Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
