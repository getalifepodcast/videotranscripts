## Summary

Join us and our special guest Jacky Hart as we discuss the Charity Commission and the time period when the PBCC lost their charitable tax status! Could it be that the doubleminded PBCC filed a report agreeing that families had the 100% right to decide whether or not to socialize with their ex-pb families? But then why would that not happen? Oh right? That’s because it’s not actually the truth!!
Here is the link to the ‘Faith in Practice’ document that explains all the concerns the charities commission had with the brethren and what the brethren said they would do about it-

Hello, everyone. Welcome back. I hope everyone had an incredible holiday with whatever you celebrate. We are here with Richard and Carman today. We have a special guest from the UK, Jacky Hart, who's going to dive into her own story, but more so into what went on with the Charities Commissions when it was resolved in 2014, I guess it was, wasn't it? Yeah. Yes, it was. Yeah. So [we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=43s) are going to pass the mic over to Jacky and let her introduce herself and take us down that rabbit hole. Welcome, Jacky.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=51s)

Thank you, Cheryl. Hi, Richard. Hi, Carman. So as many of you will know, I'm Jacky Hart. I left the PBCC a long time ago in the mid 80s. And I'll give my story very, very briefly. I was put in the position where I had to choose between leaving my family and living with a brethren family or staying with my family. And I chose the latter and the rest was history.

My oldest brother, didn't leave with us but apart from that our family left intact so I have one brother still in the PBCC.

For many many years I married, I actually married an ex-member of the PBCC, we met and married outside, we had children, we got on with life and I would say about 12 years ago I had a phone call from my brother in the PBCC and this had never happened he had never called me we'd had very very occasional contact we didn't know when he'd married we didn't know when he'd had children um we'd had occasional contact over issues [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=119s) my parents but that was it um he phoned me and it was probably about the back end of 2011\. And in the phone call, he asked me if I, as somebody not opposed to the Brethren, would be prepared to write a letter to the Charity Commission supporting the Brethren as a charitable entity.

I declined that but what it triggered in me was the sort of what could be so important that my brother would pick up the phone and phone me and ask that question so I started to do a bit of research around it and that's basically sort of what I wanted to talk about today is what the issues were and how the resolution on the issues decided between the Brethren and the Charity Commission could help to bring about change or even help [members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=180s) that are still in the Brethren if they're listening. So that's a very brief synopsis of where I've came from and how I got involved with this.

Subsequent to that we have been involved with the Charity Commission thing, we met with them in the summer no summer 2015 we had a meeting with them um to discuss the issues um I personally have tried to challenge my brother's behavior towards my parents who are not in the Brethren um and it was unsuccessful um I can explain why later in the podcast but to give a little bit of a history of the background um I don't know if [Should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=218s) I start there? Give you a very brief bit of the history of how we...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=222s)

Yeah, I work around.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=225s)

So, Richard, please correct me if I'm wrong in any factual information, because I know you were probably still in the PBCC when the issues first arose, but I'll again keep it succinct.

There was one particular Brethren Gospel Hall Trust, the Preston Down Trust in the UK, that had to apply for its charitable status. Now the reason the Gospel Hall Trust had to reapply for their charitable status was because in the UK there was a law change in 2006 that said charities had to evidence that they were there for public benefit. Now prior to that any religious charity under charity law that [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=267s) it was a religious organization automatically got charitable status but the change in law meant that they then had to prove that they were providing public benefit as well as being a religious organisation or through being a religious organisation and the Preston Down Trust came unstuck because the Charity Commission basically turned down their application for charitable status.

As a result of that I think the Brethren went on a very massive offensive to defend their charitable status and they lobbied MPs, they submitted all sorts of evidence that showed they were there for public benefit, their street preachings, the openness and of easy access of their church worship, that said a little bit tongue-in-cheek.

And I actually had one member of the House of Lords say to me the level of lobbying was unprecedented she had never seen lobbying like that they were brethren allegedly in I mean Richard's nodding his head but they were brethren in the House of Commons daily talking to MPs.

They very much played the card they were religious minority that were being persecuted which of course was quite a popular card to play um and ultimately the Charity Commission backed down and granted them their charitable status. There was a but to this the way in which they got their charitable status was every brethren gospel hall trust which I think there's probably somewhere in the region of 60 odd in [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=375s) UK I I can't remember the actual number but something like that had to agree to adopt a deed of variation into their trustees. And this deed of variation included a document called the Faith in Practice document that laid out in their deeds how they saw their faith being demonstrated in practice that showed the public benefit.

 And sorry, I'll backtrack a slight bit. The other concern of the Charity commissions was not just the demonstration of public benefit it was also the evidence they had of detriment and harm that was caused by the PBCC and a lot of that evidence of detriment and harm came from ex-members but not only ex-members they actually commissioned a full report into the PBCC by quite an eminent [doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=430s) called Dr Eileen Barker, who gave a very fair report on the PBCC's practices. So it wasn't just ex-members' stories of how they've been cut off from families and all the things that you've discussed on your podcast that caused so much harm to people.

There was an independent report.

And in charity law if it can be evidence that the detriment and harm outweighs any public benefit that charity cannot register as a charity so that's in essence the decision the charity commission made was whether the evidence of harm they had outweighed the evidence of public benefit they had.

And they ultimately decided that it didn't but there was a but it was this faith in practice document that had to be adopted and it was also um reading through the document which I had a quick read just before we started this discussion they said it was obvious to them that the Preston Down Trust was evolving and changing as a charity and that was one of the other reasons why they agreed to run with giving them their charitable status.

The Faith in Practice document comes at the end of the 55 pages and it basically lays out their principles of separation and I suppose this is something that I'd like to highlight for any members in the Brethren who listen to these podcasts. They specifically state separation is moral and not physical talking about separation from evil I'm not talking about separation from people separation from evil is moral [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=538s) not physical. The Charity Commission state in their report that some of their concerns was the physical separation so i.e families being split up not mixing with the wider community and the insular environment of the PBCC.

Um and they specifically say it's moral not physical. So, and that, I suppose, could be interpreted and we could discuss that in many ways. What is moral separation and what is physical separation? If you take it to the very simple no eating and drinking, I would probably argue that's a physical separation to say I will not eat and drink with you. If you take it in the terms of, well, actually I'm eating and drinking with you, but I don't agree with you and I think you're evil, but I'm still being polite and nice and kind to you because I'm a caring person, that might be moral separation, but I don't know, I'm sure all of you may have views on that as [well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=591s)

So that was one thing. The other aspect was their treatment of former members and their treatment of members who leave the community. And there's a paragraph in there in which they say should somebody wish to leave the community the PBCC will support that person to do so where that person has been totally dependent on the community which of course we as ex-members all know most people there are totally dependent on the community their jobs their livelihoods their families everything in their life is dependent on the community so anyone trying to leave needs that stepping stone to find an alternative life.

And it says that as far as reasonably practical and that that support could be financial or you know physical and so on. The other aspect of what they say in here is that every endeavor will be made um I can quote the actual wording but I'm going off memory now every endeavor will be made to allow to continue family relationships once a member of the community leaves.

And that doesn't happen as we know as we absolutely know. Now I tried to put this document to test a few times with people trying to leave um with my own brother and so on. The answer you always get is also covered in the document and in their faith in practice and it says it's up to each individual member of the community to they have a choice they can decide how much [contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=703s) they have they can choose decide whether they want to stay and leave they can choose whether they talk to their family not in the Brethren so if you challenge it say with any of the Gospel Hall trusts or the trustees the church effectively wash their hands of it and say it's up to each individual member the church doesn't influence um and that's exactly what happened when I challenged not not my brother's non-[communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=734s) with me um it was more my brother's non-communication with my parents who are not in the Brethren and who are obviously getting elderly um you know it's mother and son he's their first born son and it was that I challenged um but it was apparently up to my brother to decide um and they have a choice about it now my argument to that is although it's quite hard to say I I don't believe the brethren do have a choice [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=764s) it because that's a bit like saying as somebody pointed out to me if you're born in China you'll speak Mandarin because that's what you're born and brought up with but you wouldn't say that person chooses to speak Mandarin they do because that's what they're brought up with and to me being born and brought up in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church is the same you don't choose to separate yourself you don't choose to cut off your family that leave that's your mindset that's your [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=794s) is no element of choice. I don't know what your thoughts on that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=797s)

Yeah I mean the other thing that strikes me about it is of course if say you're inside the brethren and your brother leaves and you decide to maintain contact with him the next thing that's going to happen is that is that you yourself are going to be ostracized because you've been maintaining contact with them. Yes it's still your choice and then the people who are ostracizing you in turn it's their personal choice and so on ad infinitum. So yes they have a choice but they [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=827s) be kicked out if they do. Yes the hand the hand behind the scene is never revealed which is the constant um it's a combination of peer pressure and ministry and past ministry and phone calls and priestly visits none of which are actually documented with of course the the exception of the printed ministry but which leads me to a question that horrific incident with Bruce Hales in [Sutton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=858s) where he was telling someone to take rat poison rather than contact his own sister. How could they possibly fit that into their faith in practice document because it was a very blatant example of telling someone not to contact their own sister who was out of fellowship by the leader of the PBCC themselves. It's just hard to wriggle out of that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=881s)

It is hard, but I think the excuse used was the same public face they used. The comments were taken out of context, so on and so forth.

I will tell you now, the Charity Commission are very aware of every word of that ministry, but still chose to take no action.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=900s)

Yes, very cowardly of them, really.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=902s)

It is, yes.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=903s)

They couldn't really have asked for a more glaring example. I mean it had all the elements there that they objected to, didn't it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=911s)

Yeah and those particular comments were said in a building that is a place of public religious worship.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=919s)

Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=919s)

I know there was only brethren there but it is registered for the place of public religious worship. So you would think that there would be concerns those sorts of comments were being made. It was also a setting. So I don't know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=934s)

But no I should say what a foundation for him to come out and say what he said in that in in that meeting right like it's just this subtle influence that we know he has this subtle but powerful influence that we know he has when it comes to um members in the PBCC communicating with those that have left right like it's yeah and this is the thing about Bruce that I keep on trying to to reiterate is he has this very [subtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=964s) smooth way of knocking down all these walls all these ideologies that people could have with just this subtle smooth one sentence right he's just got such a way the way he and I mean he doesn't come across as a smart man when he speaks he doesn't I mean we've heard him talk it's not it's not like some um minister you would see on tv or in other establishments right he's he doesn't come across that smart but he's just got this way [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=999s) maneuvering his words that just knock everybody down in front of him and they don't realize it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1005s)

I think that comes down to his perfect self-confidence and the fact that he knows that his entire audience will automatically believe everything he says. So he makes these statements very calmly which his audience accepts as being completely factual and true but to those of us outside we listen to it you say look he's lying through his teeth but he doesn't give any of the kind of visual clues that he knows he's saying [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1035s) dishonest because he has this complete confidence in his own ability to mislead everyone.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1041s)

Yeah, yeah. There's also this concept, isn't there, that I think the brethren have, of the thought police. And you go back to what you're saying about, I suppose you call it a conscience, but I think a lot of the brethren live with that. And Bruce Hales is part of that thought police. You know well I'm not going to say or do that because what would Bruce Hales say you know and and so so it comes back to the things that were saying that if if we were to say well I'd like to contact [my](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1071s) relative that's out of the brethren just to check they're okay and you know they're well and then it's oh I better not do that but it's not even having a conversation it's those that that thought please thing that's completely ski whiff with the brethren from the terms of conscience that's just no you shouldn't do it right you know you just know you just know you don't do that right because that's what you've been taught from birth.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1095s)

Right exactly like it's one of the biggest things that has astonished me is it's been over six months since I came up with the truth right and not one person from Maple Creek has contacted me it just blows my mind every day that goes by when I haven't gotten a phone call from Tim Bond or from somebody that I know supposedly is helping the young people who have left or the young people in there not one not one contact right like [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1125s) just absolutely absurd and you know those of us that are out here know okay if we were to call up our parents or if we were to call up somebody they'd probably have a conversation with us right they would have it was it'd be a very diluted conversation the thing is they never call us on their own. They would never. I would never, my sister would never just call me up and be like, Hey, I just want to check in with you and see how you're doing. But that would never happen. Not by her choice.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1154s)

Only if they want a letter written to the Charity Commission. That's the only time it happened for me.

But you're like Cheryl, a call from somebody in there you just it never happens no it would never happen.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1168s)

No no.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1169s)

Again it's their conscience because if someone calls them that's not of their volition so they kind of feel well that's different but they're not going to do it because they'd have a bad conscience about it they'd have to confess that they had made a phone call and then they'd have to explain why they'd made the phone call so the thing is they're they are Bruce Hales doesn't police their thoughts he trains them to police their own thought from a very young age. That's the clever thing about it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1199s)

I had an interesting experience with my brother, actually while all this was going on, it was back in 2013\. I have two older brothers. The middle one of the two who is out of the brethren was critically ill. He's fine now, but we did think it was life and death. So I obviously spoke to my older brother to tell him that my middle brother was ill. And during that time, I probably spoke to my brother in only about my brother's illness [and,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1229s) you know, but probably several times a week. And the conversation did veer. And it was almost like it was it was very strange. I got on very well with my oldest brother. And it was almost like normality. At that for a very small point in time the minute my middle brother became better and it was about three four months the shutters came down right completely came down they just went vroom. Now analyzing that it was all I mean I don't know this is speculation it was almost as if while there was this critical crisis situation, the brethren would find it core. His thought police or whoever he felt he was accountable to found it quite [acceptable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1283s) in his head for him to chat, to phone, to respond to my calls, giving an update on how things were going with treatment and so on and so forth. The minute that crisis was over, whew.

Yeah, that's how it goes. And I don't know if that gives an insight into the perhaps the levels at which they might communicate. I don't know.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1306s)

I think it's that their conscience needs something to hang an excuse on. So while he had that sort of overriding conscience that your mutual brother was extremely sick, he actually enjoyed the contact with you. But as soon as there wasn't that excuse, then he would feel guilty about it. Yes. And it shows that the actual family feelings are actually there, but they're suppressed. It's not that they hate you, it's that their conscience forbids them from speaking to [you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1336s)

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1336s)

Yes. And I suppose, you know, we talked about it quite a lot afterwards as a family, and I suppose if anyone was saying, well, why are you having contact with your sister? There was a reason, as you say, that was completely acceptable in the brethren's eyes, you know, that it was, you know, unlike the ministry about rat poison, there was a reason that made it completely acceptable for that period of time.

The hardest thing is though, when you get the shutters come down again, that hurts. It's almost better not to have had the contact to be honest, because it hurts. But hey-ho, we move on. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1377s)

With this, with this, with this, a Charity Commission report and everything that they put into place, how do they keep tabs on whether they're following through with this? I mean, now that I've heard the story kind of come out, how you, how you played it out, it really shows why they're so adamant with RRT and why they really, really push their RRT in every way and why they look for those pictures and those photo opportunities and those tv news production opportunities [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1408s) because it is their way of holding on to their charity status but I guess my question is how do they keep how do they make sure that they're following all these um points that they gave yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1420s)

…that they actually haven't slipped back into their old ways which essentially I think they have done. The answer to that is they don't. So what they did for a period of time they couldn't monitor all the gospel trust but they did monitor Preston Down Trust. So all the Gospel Hall Trusts adopted this deed of variation through 2014, in that year, and they monitored Preston Down Trust. And there is a [subsequent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1451s) short report that came out, I think it may have been 2015, I can't remember the actual date, that says in the time they've monitored Preston Down Trusts, they have seen evidence of continuing and strengthening engagement outside the community. No evidence of detriment and harm at all in that time they've monitored them. Therefore, they're quite happy.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1475s)

I mean, it's completely stupid because the Brethren knew which trust was being monitored. You know, it's like saying, you know, there's a gang of bank robbers. So you tell the robbers, we're going to watch this one bank for six months. And if it doesn't get robbed, then we'll know you're not robbing banks anymore. I mean that's exactly the logic of it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1492s)

Yeah that is exactly what happened. Preston Down Trust did not shut anybody up, they did not withdraw from anybody and that's when they would be monitored. Yeah yeah probably would have been a good time to have been a member of Preston Down Trust because you could have got away with everything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1511s)

Well I mean one thing that has changed since that Faith in Practice document came out and you know I've seen this from the inside, is that they suddenly became very reluctant to formally or publicly shut anyone up or withdraw from anyone. It just, you know, the words were never used. You know, I was told, I was told, I mean, it's actually in Regina. I mean, I was told, you know, I got in trouble over this. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1541s) had this terrible road accident. Another problem came up and brother said to me um yeah you're not going to be you know you're not going to be confined about this you're not going to be shut up anyway within a week I was confined and I went back to the brother and I said you know you said this wasn't happening oh well yeah well you're not confined or shut up this is something different you know so they're still doing it they're just not naming it yeah right so that you could never say that this actually happened to you I just wasn't, it would be best if I didn't come to the [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1571s) and I wasn't asleep with my wife and I wasn't asleep in the same room, but I'm not confined or shut up. And then they use this, they basically use what I call constructive dismissal, where they make your life so miserable, you take yourself out.

And then they say, no, no, we didn't withdraw from him. He took himself off. And that's that. So they've changed to that degree. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1596s)

Yeah, that's exactly what they do now. And one of the Charity Commission's big concerns was the confining and withdrawing from people and the effect that had on families and so on and Eileen Barker in her report summarised this in my opinion very accurately as an independent person the Brethren denied that that that her report was accurate and they didn't have too in fairness and they didn't have too much chance to comment on her report but excuse me putting my glasses on [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1626s) will just read yeah they they actually listed out in the document how they cope with confining and shutting up.

So on page 50 in circumstances necessitating pastoral care including but not limited to where fault occurs and there's a scriptural quote then pastoral care is provided where church admission is necessary due provision will be made for the welfare of the church member who is under review.

This should cover emotional health family and financial considerations I'll skip read a little bit um so basically that is how they would now approach confining and shutting up um persons investigating any matter should those that are morally or spiritually qualified sorry persons investigating any matter should be those that are morally and spiritually qualified in order to [display](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1691s) the necessary advocacy for and humility towards the person concerned this this must include the ability to ascertain whether the person being cared for shows repentance and contrition uh there's a bit about facts where spiritual persons discern that god has forgiven the person concerned but the matters confessed to by the person concerned extend beyond the fault and need to be settled in the assembly the first principle for the [assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1721s) to consider is remission and forgiveness on the basis of the holy scriptures and it goes on wow um they and then the the interesting bit that goes back to what Richard was saying about making it to be somebody's choice to leave. If repeated pastoral care is unsuccessful then the next stages of admonition could include one inviting the person being cared for to attend the meeting of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1751s) assembly to listen to an appeal and if suitable present their differences. Two a shrinking from the person concerned which involves minimising social contact with the person for a limited period to provide them with the space and time to make a private and personal choice about their continuing in the fellowship.

That's how they get round it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1776s)

The problem is it's impossible in reality to police any of this because it's all put in in religious language. I mean in reality the only way the Charity Commission could effectively police it is simply by looking at the um looking at the facts I mean yes are people being contacted or not period without digging into exactly who was making that decision I mean and the reality is the people who've [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1806s) have been cut off and they remain cut off yeah and and that's not the choice of the people who've been cut off. The choice of brethren members it is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1813s)

Yeah I mean the angle taken by the Charity Commission was that they, this is back in 2014-15, they, as a regulatory body, they would prefer to help a charity to change rather than take away charitable status.

And what's put forward in their report was very much this is a charity that's evolving and changing.

Um but my argument to that is if we say that all the Gospel Hall trusts adopted this in 2014 since the end of 2014 how many people have left the brethren and I will say just in the UK at the moment because although the brethren say this is universal I understand that they will use the argument all that only applies to the UK yeah so how many people have left say since the start of 2015 that it has [still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1871s) resulted in them losing contact with their children with their parents I think I could include you in that one couldn't I Richard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1878s)

Oh 100% yeah yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1880s)

So how if if if a person who knew very little about the brethren read this document how would they perceive the reality of how the brethren behave because I don't think most reasonable people would think that every effort is taken to help people who want to leave and that every effort is made to continue family relationships when a member leave.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1908s)

Exactly. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1910s)

And that's the problem. And I suppose the only people I think, you can challenge the Charity Commission, you can send them what you perceive to be breaches of this you can tell them about cases where this just hasn't happened um generally speaking you get a very stock answer that says thank you for your contact a little blurb about the regulator and what they do and we will keep your information on file but at this point in time the Charity [Commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1940s) I see no reason to investigate.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1943s)

It really needs a change of law it needs a further step and with uh when you finally get to change from your particularly lousy government in the UK, it does look like the Labour government does have a, take a dim view of the PBCC, so that could be very promising.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=1961s)

Yes, yes it could and I agree with you and the National Secular Society actually brought out a report two or three years back, so the charity law at the moment, as I said right at the beginning, if you set up a charity whose aims and objectives include furtherance of religion or you know the preaching of the gospel or whatever religion it is you are automatically as long as you can demonstrate public benefit now register as a charity.  
The National Secular Society did a full report asking about the relevance of this in the UK in today's you know today's society in that should a charity that's there for religion automatically get charitable status. Yeah. It was a report. It hasn't gone any further than that. But that's what you're saying, essentially, Richard, isn't it? But it's there is an argument with I think it was the last census showed that less than half of the UK population claimed to be Christian. Yes. So whatever your personal views are, society has changed since that charity laws set up.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2026s)

It's discrimination against persons who are non-religious as well, if they make a special provision for things that come under the heading of religion. I mean, the other thing that strikes me very strongly that could be looked at from a government point of view is the fact that the PBCC apparently only spend about 2% of their charitable income on external benefit. Now, if and that's extraordinary in the [sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2057s) that if you were to take that argument down to individuals, I could say if I gave 2% of my income to a charitable cause, then I shouldn't have to pay any income tax. I mean, that's effectively what the tiny, a tiny sprinkle of fairy dust on the top of this great big commercial empire, tiny sprinkle of charitable dust and the whole thing gets tax exempt. So why couldn't it be regulated in such a way that, [yes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2087s) they get tax relief on the 2% they spend for genuinely charitable purposes, and they can damn well pay their taxes on the rest. I mean, the government would be very happy and probably fund half the NHS if they did that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2101s)

It probably would, yeah. Yeah, it was. I mean, it's a really interesting one because if you read through some of the charity reports from the, you know, from the Brethren charities that are registered like the Grace Trust or so on, they do do that. They list all the charities they give to but as a percentage of their income it's not very high but equally they come out with very um I don't know what words to call them really statements for example that say things like um our [charity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2134s) money is used to help people with housing people in people in the community so the community which now somebody that doesn't understand how the brethren structure works would read a sentence that say x percent whatever percentage higher than two percent will help with um housing for people in the community and they think oh isn't that nice helping people whereas in essence what they're actually doing is helping brethren people [buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2164s) expensive houses in the UK yes because they need to be detached yes so it is helping people The right questions are not being asked.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2173s)

Yes, exactly. It's just crazy, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2177s)

It is, and it's about trying to, the government bodies joining up the dots and realising that this spin, this wording, it could be read if you don't understand the brethren and how they operate. It could be read one way but if you do understand the community when they say they're spending this money on the community only refers by and large to brethren community not the community of the UK or you know because I mean what what's going to happen?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2204s)

What's going to happen I hope is Labour have spoken about this they want to remove the charitable status of private schools yes that will wipe out because I mean probably probably 80 percent of the charitable tax receipts the Grace trust anywhere in the UK and I'm assuming the Grace Trust is a fairly good snapshot of what goes on globally probably 80% of it does go to their private schools doesn't it and then there's maybe 20% that's just surplus that's swilling around they don't know what to do [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2235s) yes so that's going to wipe out a big chunk of it yeah and then if they then if they look at the rest of it and they start asking well you know exactly what are you doing with this money in the community I mean I'm a bit suspicious I've never seen or heard of anyone actually in the Brethren receiving any kind of charitable help from any kind of Brethren trust I mean it may happen in a few cases but it must be very rare.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2259s)

I do know of one case.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2261s)

Right right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2262s)

I do know and it was exactly as I demonstrated it was a house move that I'll be careful what I say because it's I want to protect people who told me but it was a house move whereby the family wanted to move to a different area but couldn't afford it. So one of the Brethren charities made up the shortfall, which was substantial, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2292s) essentially that trust has a claim on the house.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2296s)

Oh yes, yes. Yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2300s)

So effectively they give them the capital, so they give them the grant of the capital. They don't, as I understand it, they don't exactly have to pay it back. But if they sold the house, they would have to pay it back.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2309s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2313s)

And if you think about it, there's probably nothing illegal about that because the trust is demonstrating they're investing in property that they would then have a claim on in the event of you know um think something happening so they can demonstrate that's a financial investment of the trust money the person people concerned get to move to an even more expensive house which is um...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2336s)

It's not exactly helping the homeless is it which is what you would imagine from reading their description of it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2340s)

Exactly it's what you would imagine from reading their description of it yes. Yeah exactly if you read the description you'd be thinking they are trying to find home you know yeah roofs over people's it's whereas it's not really it's on a different level so.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2354s)

So is the government, is the government in the UK is it, are they very much tied hand in hand with the PBCC too like they are in other places like are they very politically intertwined?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2366s)

 Richard probably answered that better than me I believe so but I don't think we have had as much exposure of it as they have say in Canada and in New Zealand and Australia.

I certainly know the Brethren are very friendly with MPs.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2390s)

Well, Damian Hastie did a very interesting series of Twitter posts, tweets, all of which were pictures of Conservative MPs taking tours of Brethren-owned businesses, and there were dozens and dozens of them. There were dozens of them. And given the proportion of businesses in the UK that are brethren, it's very clear to me, and I can be a little less tactful than Jacky, seeing as I'm out of the country, that yes, they are very much [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2420s) in the same bed with the Conservative Party in multiple ways at the Cabinet level and at the MP level. And of course, the whole VIP, private VIP lane to pandemic contracts is proof of that, because that's an extraordinary handout from a political party to a very unpleasant and actually numerically quite small cult in the country. And don't you try and tell me that there aren't [kickbacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2451s) and handbacks out of all that. I mean, it's already coming out, isn't it? I mean in some of the non-Brethren cases of VIP contracts there was that, what's her name, Baroness Mone or something. Yeah very appropriate name.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2464s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2465s)

I mean the money gets back to the political people who award the contract, allegedly.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2475s)

Yeah I would agree and I suppose my hesitation about the help in general elections and so on is because I am 99% certain it would go on because it has done in every country. And as we know, what one country does in the PBCC, another country does because it's usually a universal directive. But I have no evidence of that. It's the same guy running the whole thing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2499s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2499s)

In every country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's no shortage of proof for that, especially when you look at all the contracts that were given through COVID.

The other interesting thing about the law in the UK, we'll digress a little bit from the document but I'll come back to that, but the law in the UK, I think one state in Australia just passed it, but we have had the coercive control laws in place since 2015\.

And the coercive control laws they've been tried and tested now there have been quite a few cases where they've been proven and they were basically bought in in the UK as law to address cases of domestic abuse that weren't physical because physical abuse is relatively or probably more more readily provable if somebody presses charges than coercive abuse. The problem we have in the UK, which is something a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2563s) has come out to try and address, is these coercive control tactics are laid out in law. And if you read the tactics, I can't remember off the top of my head, that it's judged whether it is coercive control, it's things like telling people, somebody who they can and can't be friends with, telling them what to wear, having that level of control.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2584s)

Where they can go, where they live.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2586s)

That's it, where they live, where they can go and everything.

The PBCC do just about every one of them to their members. But the problem in law is at the moment in the UK, it says these can only be found proven, if found proven, in a close family relationship. So it could happen between partners, it could happen between husband and wife, it could even happen between parents and children and it has indeed there was one case where that did happen nothing related to the PBCC so if in the UK anyone were to try and bring a case against they could not bring a case against the PBCC for coercive control but they could bring a case against their family well nobody's going to want to do that are they you know you're not going to want to bring a case of that. So there is a big call to change it to coercive control can also be demonstrated in a group setting. In other words, a group can coercively control its members. If that became law, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2652s) there is a call for it to become law, then that would be a game changer.

Absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2659s)

And I think that's our key. That is that is our key in in solving any of this why I'm so fixated on this course of control law to get established anywhere right because if we can get it into one area then we just need to find a way to get it into the other countries. I actually had a lady reach out to me who is a PhD student. I actually can't remember where she reached out to me from but somewhere in Canada. I believe it was Canada and she actually wants to sit down and work with me on course of control and the ins and outs of it [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2689s) I messaged her back yesterday I'm like I'm all in like where do I sign up because I do know that that is I mean I would bypass everything I would stop everything if someone came to me and said okay Cheryl I need you to put your 24/7 time into the course of control that's where I would jump I would I would go straight into that because I know that that is what we need in order to be able to do what we need to do to help our families that are still inside.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2715s)

Yes yes because it makes what's if it became um I mean there was a report brought out earlier this year by the family survival trust um which was about coercive control and group and calling for a law change and so the family survival trust are a charity in the UK uh that help sort of not not just but cult leaders or people who have got involved with cults need help and um I've had some dealings with them and this report is calling for a change in law for group coercive control and if that [became](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2746s) law in any country it would basically make what the brethren do illegal.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2751s)

Yeah yeah and that's the long and short of it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2753s)

It would it would not not just make it unethical or immoral it would be illegal because what the report was saying with a group doing it what you have to focus on is the behavior and the outcome and the behavior of a group that's coercively controlling is identical to the coercive control of a controlling partner or a controlling parent that's not allowing their children the freedom they should have.

And the outcome is the same. The harm cause is the same. So you shouldn't be focusing what it's saying. You shouldn't be focusing on who's doing it. You should be focusing on the behavior and the outcome.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2792s)

That's very, very interesting because you've then got an interesting situation because you've already got a coercive control law which applies to family situations and so then if you also have one that applies to cult situations they can no longer pass responsibility down to the family I mean already you might say it's difficult for them to pass responsibility for the family because if this behavior and outcome is taking place if [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2822s) brethren say well it's the family then the family are already breaking the existing law. Yes. But of course, then the family can pass it back to the cult and then that's not illegal at the moment. No. But if you close both doors, then, you know, somewhere to go.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2838s)

Nowhere to go, yeah. There's nowhere to go.

So it's very slow, like anything legal, but I'd like to think it will happen. And I think if it happens in one country, as you say, Cheryl, that's a precedent then to the other. I mean, I think I can't remember which state it was in Australia, but they got it New South Wales that got. Yeah, New South Wales passed this year or last year. So there's yet another one. I think their laws are very similar to the one we the UK passed in 2015\.

Things just move slowly, but that would make very categorically make what the PBCC do illegal. In the meantime. And it would have very little...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2883s)

It would have very little effect on, on mainstream Christian churches because they don't.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2888s)

No, because your mainstream Christian church is just those churches that you're going to on Sunday that are given their, the regular preachings and testimony being read, right? It's not, it's not what, let's go, I mean, there's other religions. We've got Scientology, you've got Jehovah Witnesses, you've got Mormons, you've got PBCC we have a lot of these these big groups that all are suffering from the same part of shunning and the same part of excommunication and all the I mean there's it's not just the PBCC that are suffering from this there's a lot so the call is huge I mean I know I follow a lot of ex-Jehovah witnesses [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2926s) twitter and stuff and I mean they all are asking for the same course of control lots not just us ex-PBCC members that are asking for it there's so many that are asking for it I mean I guess it's just I always put it out there when we have this topic is like I I invite any and all anybody who has got knows how to get things going or knows how to help us get this going I invite it and that's how that email came to me was that I had on another podcast I'd asked for and she [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2956s) messaged me but it is it's like we we we invite everybody to come in and help us because helping us is also helping other people it's not just the PBCC.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2965s)

No I agree with you it's not just the PBCC that particular law and that's one very interesting point made in the family survival trust report they interviewed a lot of ex-cult members some of which were ex-brethren they anonymized all of them but they but they weren't all religious ex-cult members they were um you know sort of some buddhist monks ex-cult members so it was a cross-section of society but what came out of it loud and clear the behavior and the outcome is the same yeah and the leaving is as traumatic when [you've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=2995s) got a very insular environment that does not want you to leave the consequences of it are traumatic um so it is a very interesting report yeah and I think um I think sorry go on.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3009s)

No go ahead finish what you said.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3011s)

I was just going to say this is again says a little bit cynically but I I think in the UK it seems to be mass lobbying of the MPs works.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3020s)

And I do and I think that's a way we do need to we need to the PBCC have been doing right is the lobbying of the PMs and lobbying of government right I do think that is one of our ways it is that we haven't knocked on.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3031s)

Raising the awareness I think in whichever way we can which is why I have big respect for your podcasts all of you and for the work James DiFore is doing and anyone else in the past because it's just keeping on raising that awareness, keeping on putting the message out there. I mean I've spoken about this before but that's irrelevant really because you need to keep on speaking about it, you know.

It's reinforcing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3056s)

I say that the battle is lost or won on the Twitter search engine because any member of parliament or influential person that's approached by the PBCC, the first thing that person's going to do is Google PBCC. And at the moment, if you do that in Canada, you get a lot of very interesting headlines. And that's devastating. I mean, to anyone who has concern about their public image, they're not going [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3087s) want to be associated with this group. I mean, even if the stuff about them wasn't true, they wouldn't want to be associated because it's all about when you're a politician it's all about PR and the only way you get a high ranking on Google is by continuously generating new information Google search engine if you if you just copy and paste something was posted 10 years ago Google sees that and says this is not original content and it doesn't it gets very low on their [list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3117s) and it's really only effective if you get onto the first page. 

And so, as you say, Jacky, it's about continuously generating genuinely new information, and that keeps you on the front page. And it has a devastating, I tell you, it's a devastating effect on them. There was a very interesting article recently about the two brethren, the one schools, one one in USA, one in Canada that visited the, that visited of all places, the Human Rights Museum. And it's really hard to talk about it without falling off your chair laughing. But they had some of the exhibits censored. But the thing that was interesting is that the Brethren spent, I suspect, millions of dollars trying to keep the names of those schools out of the press. And they gave two reasons, one of which was very honest and one of which was very dishonest. The very dishonest reason they gave is that it would affect enrollment in their schools, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3177s) of course is complete bullshit. The very honest reason they gave is that it would make it very hard for them to enroll new staff and teachers. And it certainly would.

 And of course, they try and get the very best teachers. And again, as I said, you're approached by the PBCC, they want you to be a headmaster or teacher. The first thing you do is google it and you see something like that you're not going to want that on your cv if you've got a want to have a career in teaching and so I think it really really does [hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3207s) them in ways that we don't perhaps think about and and the other the other way it hurts them of course is all their existing teachers and existing staff of brethren owned companies and existing non-brethren UBT staff they all devour these podcasts and read them and they get more and more suspicious and more and more uncomfortable with what they're part of. And then one of two things happen. They either leave or they start leaking juicy little bits and pieces to us.

You might say we're just a collection of rather odd people in an odd place, sort of speaking in the wilderness, but it's not like that because put PBCC into Google, you'll see just how important it is what we're all doing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3256s)

Yeah, no, I agree with you. I agree with you. And one of the main reasons that, I mean, we talked about quite a lot, so it's been good, but I wanted this to, if there are people in the PBCC that listen to these podcasts, and I hope there are, I'm sure there are.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3273s)

Oh, there are.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3274s)

I would like, yeah, I'm certain there are. I would like them to actually go back and reread this document because the whole purpose of this is a document that the PBCC put forward as the way their faith work in practice and I would like members of the PBCC to read it and then ask themselves is this what I'm doing and actually if it isn't what they're doing this [document](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3305s) allows them to do it if they want to.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3308s)

Yes. It's on their website. It's on their website. It's actually on their website. It is. Funny thing is, when it was presented in the UK, it was read out. Everyone was given a copy. It was read out.

And then I can't remember, do you have to sign the copy or something? But then they collected all the copies back up again. You weren't allowed to keep a copy of it. But then eventually they put it on their website. And I'm sure the only reason that they did that, that was for the benefit of the Charity Commission. That wasn't for the benefit of their members, because it's kind of pretty well buried in there. It's very hard to find, but it is all.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3345s)

I'll attach a link. So the link will be in the description of this podcast.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3347s)

Thank you, Cheryl. Yeah, straight up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3349s)

Please do. Please do, because I think it's, you know, I'm certain there are people in the Brethren that have questions in their head. And I think there's certain statements about the reasonable steps to be taken to keeping family relationships going if that made one person in the PBCC read it and think you know what I [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3375s) to talk to my father I want to talk to my mother then it's been that document's been worthwhile if it made more than one so much the better because it's trying to get say what you'd like to get the message in there is actually you can contact your father mother son daughter grandfather whoever it is and you've made that personal choice and because of this document there's actually nothing they can do about it I know they can put you under a lot of psychological pressure and I understand all that uh and that's the difficult bit but actually you are legitimately allowed to do [so.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3415s)

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3416s)

And of course, if they did try and take some action as a result of that, you could just, you can point it out. Okay, it won't have any effect on them. But if you said to them, well, look, you know, I can take this to the Charity Commission if you keep pursuing me, then they will back off so fast that their shoes will be smoking.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3436s)

Yeah, I mean, I've been told. Go ahead.

No, I've been told anecdotally. I don't have evidence of this, that the one thing Bruce Hales is most scared of is losing his charitable state, that is the PBCC's charitable state. Incidentally in the UK the PBCC do not have charitable status, they are a limited company. What has charitable status is every individual Gospel Hall trust. So if you look at the PBCC itself it's not a registered charity [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3469s) that's just an aside point.

There have been a couple of occasions when this document has been used and the effect when somebody recently left has been trying to see members in and the suggestions being they use this document and it has worked, limited but worked. It does seem to be that if you can use it as a well look it's here and so on and so forth, that But they, within reason, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3503s) suppose I suspect they don't want their members to understand the nuances of this document in case it's used against them. And I do want their members to understand exactly how this document came about and how it can be used.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3522s)

It'd be very realistic to use it from the outside in. You could use it from the inside out. That would be more difficult. It would be, yeah. Both ways, yes. Both ways.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3532s)

But if enough members used it from inside out.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3535s)

That was the point I was going to make.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3537s)

Yes. That I think, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3538s)

That like we reiterate again, we're not trying to take anything down. We're not, we've got to fix the, that's why I've always asked Bruce, like, let's sit down and talk. I like, I have no issue to sit down and talk with him. I'm not, I'm not there to sit there and or whatever but let's sit down and fix the issues we have we have a high level of sexual abuse we have a high level of spousal abuse we have a high level of course of control we've got [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3568s) these things that are all fixable they are fixable but again I had someone point out to me that their their system's not broken he's made it exactly what it needs to be yes he's he's not a person him his system his system is created to do exactly what it is doing what's broken of it is those that are underneath the system that don't stand up and say something so when you have a document in your hand like this

 I mean from the amount of emails I get [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3599s) know that if you guys start standing up there's going to be people holding him I I can guarantee you guys that that if you just got to be able to stand up and have this courage and saying you know what no there needs to be change that happens here there needs to be change that happens here if you're seeing somebody who is, let's take for example somebody who went through a huge spousal abuse.

 I watch what I say here um if you if you've witnessed somebody go through huge spousal abuse and you see the [leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3631s) and the brothers that are in taking the lead or helping the leader go and put all their attention on the person that did the abusing and left the wife behind to fend for herself you should say something right? 

Like people have to start speaking up right you've just got to learn how to stand up things that are morally wrong right these are these are things that you can't you shouldn't just be turning a blind eye I mean the [amount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3661s) of emails that I get about people who have been sexually abused in there is absolutely atrocious. Like it's absolutely ridiculous. It makes me just sick to my stomach to have to go to bed at nighttime knowing that this is still happening. And yet six months later, nobody's called me. Nobody's called me to say, can you hear me, Cheryl? Let's sit down and talk. Let's talk about really what happened with Alan. 

And you know I'm going to come back and be like, you guys knew that this was happening. [He's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3691s) got a lot of history. And let's see if we can prevent it happening to anyone else. Right let's make sure that this is not happening I do have to make a correction and another podcast that I had said that um Alan was not allowed to go to meeting so he actually was it was someone corrected me yesterday and he so he was allowed to go to meeting he just wasn't allowed to partake in the meeting so he wasn't allowed to make a remark I just got to clear this up because this is even kind of funnier he was allowed to go to meeting he just wasn't allowed to make any [remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3721s) or comment in the meeting so I want to clear this up but he still is allowed to go but he wasn't allowed to partake in it he's allowed to partake now anyhow let's sit down and you know what what's piling up out here on our laps the longer you wait in there the more embarrassment you're going to have and the more things are going to be falling at your feet so we can bypass some this if you just sat down with us and we had [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3752s) conversation.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3752s)

Yeah there's a very interesting qu- sorry Carman you're going to say something?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3756s)

No no go ahead.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3758s)

There's a very interesting question that I've often asked myself and as I told you my husband is also ex-PBCC and we often say what is Bruce's end game? Yeah yeah and money yeah Richard just did it too yeah yeah I know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3774s)

Money.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3775s)

Okay okay so we all know he's got the money now what is his end game with that money we suspect his health isn't great you know if is he going to say into the sunset and say so long suckers is he going to what what is the end game or is it I don't know the answer to this it's just quite an interesting or is it there isn't an end game it's actually the pursuit of the money that is the end game. And I don't know. I'd love to. I...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3807s)

I can speak to that a bit because money is incredibly central to the whole motivation of all the higher echelons of the PBCC. In some ways, and I mean, don't misunderstand me when I say this, the sexual abuse and the spousal abuse is kind of like collateral damage. The Brethren don't want that to happen. No one in the Brethren thinks, yes, it's great to have sexual abuse and spousal abuse. It's [an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3837s) inevitable outcome of the kind of coercive paternalistic control, the exercise. But what is a deliberate and intended outcome of the coercive control is the accumulation of wealth at the top. And that's a whole big subject, which is that the coercive control which occurs in the brethren is largely directed towards making money. And the whole kind of separation thing, which is their kind of religious excuse [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3867s) this, is just to keep a captive consumer base. They don't want brethren to leave because they make money off the brethren. Every member contributes. And you'll find sometimes when brethren do get kicked out, it's probably largely because they represented a net drain on the system rather than anything they could make money out of. 

I mean, particularly in Jamaica, a large number of the poorer brethren there, and of course they were very poor by Western [standards,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3898s) have gone. And of course they were disposable because they were actually taking money out of the system rather than putting money into the system. And if you want proof of that you can look at all these clauses in all the business contracts which essentially make sure that even if individuals go the wealth and the business stays in rather than ownership and so there's a whole huge subject about using coercive control to get money out of people and it's very very blatant [it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3928s) straightforward high pressure salesmanship if you're inside there every week probably more frequently than every week.

There's a UBT initiative, you have to buy this, there's the high value headscarves, there's the this initiative, that initiative, insurance, your car, volunteer for the shop, buy all your groceries from the shop. And the list goes on and on and on. And then if you're a business owner, there's a whole raft of things that your business is supposed to subscribe [to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=3958s) You know, wonderfully valuable seminars of recycled YouTube videos from the, I was going to say from the 1960s, but YouTube didn't exist in the 1960s. It's all about money. And the coercive control is all directed to that end. Towards making money. And I think this is going to be their Achilles heel because they have long since stepped outside decent, upright business practice. They've long been in the shadows in terms of tax evasion. And now there's multiple cases of outright criminality.

And in terms of what Bruce's end game is, I think it's a dynasty, it's a dynastic system. And it's very inherent in human nature. And I mean, it's actually a good thing is that you look after your kids first. You look after your family. You like to think. And I mean, you see this all the time. I mean, the place I work, it's an Italian business. And there's a couple of old guys, brothers, and they work their guts out, although they're past retiring age, because it's a family business. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4028s) you think, look, you know, why don't you just retire and live off the benefit? Well, they're passing it on to their children. Yeah. And I think that's really what Bruce is all about. He's setting up his children to be extremely wealthy and successful leaders. And that's just human nature. 

And so, yeah, he's on his last legs and he's an alcoholic. And he's probably locked in the basement for 23 hours out of [24\.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4058s) But the end game is, and hopefully it doesn't get this, you know we'll probably live to see this happen Bruce will pop his clogs and then the next generation of extremely wealthy coercive crooked high-powered Haleses will take over the family business I mean the brethren the PBCC is the Haleses family business it's just like these other giant corporations with 55,000 employees yeah [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4089s) just directs the money to the top.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4091s)

I think you're probably right. I think you're probably right about the end game there Richard I I am yeah yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4097s)

I was kind of thinking as Jacky was talking if you look at 2014 and this whole document coming out that's kind of the point where Bruce Hales started to make himself less available you know you think back on his father and the previous leaders beforehand you could ring them up or you could talk to them whereas Bruce has pulled himself separate almost like there's a schism between him and all his people which may be playing into his dynasty his end game because he's made himself [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4127s) available. 

Like you literally cannot pick up a phone call a phone and call him and it makes me wonder with that document saying that anybody could make a choice to talk to people outside he's not involving himself he's keeping his name out of it so he can't be blamed therefore there's like insulation between him and the decisions that are being made you know he's protecting his dynasty at the top and protecting himself and making himself completely unavailable. And that should be a huge red flag to [anybody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4157s) that's inside there. Look at what he's done to himself. He's not available. No leader that's a true leader is not available to his people.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4168s)

That's a really good point, Carman. And I think going back to what we're saying, you know, pressure will come on the PBCC. It will come and go from external angles. The Charity Commission authority bodies and it will come and go and lawyers are very good at getting out of it yeah what will really change the PBCC is people inside asking the questions you've just cited Carman you know hang on a minute this document came out that basically shows [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4198s) lovely friendly caring compassionate face of the PBCC but are we actually demonstrating that and as you say Bruce Hales I think would not want to be at the end of that chain if that was challenged properly challenged it was due to go to the high court early January 2014 and they actually accepted this I think it was two or three days before they did not want it to go to the high court because the Charity Commission had the whole lot of the [evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4228s) of the public benefit and the harm and detriment would have all come out in a public court hearing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4235s)

And I think it's something that massive sorry gone Carman.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4238s)

There was something that Peter told us last on the last podcast that I think is really important to bring it back up and say to people really seriously think about this okay they were assigning blockers at the end of the aisles so that when Bruce walked out of the meeting room no one could approach him with an honest question and that might that might have been the last one that we did with um Ann Hamilton whatever the case they were assigning blockers so that the normal [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4269s) could not ask Bruce a question now the only reason you would do that is you're scared that Bruce is actually going to answer that question.

Right you know they don't want they don't want the normal people to get to Bruce because Bruce might answer that question and then if you quote Bruce's name on it well Bruce is not protected. No, you're not protecting your leader you're not protecting your dynasty if you let them interact with the normal people and I think people need to stop and really seriously think about that in the past you could always access your leaders yeah what you've got now is a dictatorship where the dictator's at the top and nobody on a normal level can actually access him why is that?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4311s)

That was in Ann's podcast. Okay. Yeah, it was Ann's podcast because she wanted to talk to him, right? I remember she had a gift for him that she had made that she was in a past him and that was her way of getting to talk to him.

And you guys might inside might be told, oh, well, we've got people who we can talk to that talk to Mr. Hales and get back to us. So it's not that. But it is that. It is that. You should be able to ring up Mr. Hales. Everybody should have. I mean I remember growing up at home you got the list beside the phone it had all everybody's numbers Mr. Hales should be up there you should be able to pick up that phone call and you should be able to just hey I I need to talk to you if that's not happening.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4353s)

And I think that Bruce learned a lesson at the very end of his father's life and Bruce was making judgments that his father didn't know about and because I personally rang up his father when Bruce was not in the house and Mrs. Hales told me Bruce is just left for work do you want to wait until Bruce gets here and I said no I'd like to speak to Mr. Hales and in this situation Mr. Hales said well I have not been told anything about this matter so Bruce learned a very important lesson [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4383s) the very end of his father's life and he's making sure that doesn't happen now. Yeah yeah. I think that's really important and people inside there should be waking up and going wait why is this yeah there's a reason there's a big reason and and it should make you stop and go wow if I if and I think back to grandpa Symington's time people would call and they would think by giving their whole situation to Chester and Chester was grandpa Symington's brother they would think well Chester's going to take the details of my case and he's going to go over to Mr. Symington [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4420s) he's going to get me an answer. Well, let me tell you what really happened. A lot of times Chester had a whole table full of visitors on the Lord's day and he sat and discussed the details of that whole case at the table with all his visitors. And there's plenty of people that can back me up. I'm not making that story up. So you got the answer. I hate to tell you, but you got the answer from the table full of visitors that were at Chester's house on Lord's day for dinner. And sometimes those questions did not even go to grandpa Simington. And second, second thing is what spin was put on it between what you said and what actually went to him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4458s)

Involved in between.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4461s)

He can't make a correct judgment on a case that has been spun around a table full of visitors on Sunday at dinner, you know, stop and think if you're not actually able to access and able to get a straightforward person-to-person answer why why absolutely everybody needs to say why.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4482s)

Yeah and I think that's the purpose I I think that's quite a lot that comes out in the podcast that you guys do um is the factual stuff and if it can just make people inside the brethren just sit down and think enough of them hang on a minute and and as Cheryl said many times and I totally agree with It is not being opposed to their faith. It is not being opposed even to their moral separation from evil. I think most of us try and practice that on one level or another. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4512s) mean, you know, it's not being opposed to that. It's not being opposed to going to meetings every day. It's not being opposed to what they want to do. It's about stopping the harm in all its forms. That doesn't have to be there, whether it's sexual abuse, whether it's stopping families seeing each other, stopping that. Because you could actually have a brethren meeting and keep morally separate but not cause the harm so yeah let's let's talk to Bruce Hales and the others.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4544s)

He's not gonna want to though.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4546s)

He's not talking to the people inside I'm pretty sure he's not gonna want to talk to us I mean my message to Bruce always is then you know what it's how this is all happening and how we're taking this down the more that we expose this are the more people that we're getting from inside contacting us the more teachers that are contacting us the more principals that are contacting us it's just it's going to come tumbling down sooner or later Bruce it will it will if there's there's no doubt in my mind that it's not going to but [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4578s) doesn't have to go down the way that you're asking it to go down because you're asking it to go down this way by not talking to us I mean.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4585s)

I I agree I I actually I don't give a monkeys that Bruce has got millions good luck to him you know oh my all right you know that's fine what you what I think most of us care about is the fallout from that the fallout of how those millions are acquired in whatever shape or form and that's what we are if we're called opposed us for doing that then yes I am opposed to sexual abuse and things that go on that are blatantly wrong and immoral so fine [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4616s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4616s)

It's just I think about my mom slaving away so all hours of the night making what she needs to make for bake sales and making for this and making for that when she's got such bad health issues that's who I fight for is she shouldn't have to be slaving away.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4632s)

It's so sickening to think of an old lady like that slaving away, making cakes, having bought the ingredients at her own expense, making cakes for bake sale, to send money to a multi-billionaire businessman in Australia who's got his own jet.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4649s)

I mean, they're told it's going to school. I mean, they're told it's going to school, but it's a bunch of... And you know, my mum is so caring. She's just so caring that for her she would do it to her knuckles blood right because that's just who she is and if that's the part that makes me so sad is that there's how many thousands of those types of women who have been bred for that reason and are slaving away with not wearing rose-colored glasses blinders on and they [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4679s) no idea what's pulling them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4682s)

Just the comment I agree with you they say they believe it's going to charity it's going to the schools but just to break that comment down for a moment who set the schools up and why the brethren did to keep their children separate because every other school in every other country is a wicked place where their children will fall into wicked terrible things now my children went to normal schools um I'm sure yours did Carman I'm sure yours did Cheryl and Richard I'm sure your your little baby [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4712s) due course will go to a normal school they don't it the brethren schools have been set up almost on a falsehood you know.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4723s)

I was just gonna say let's discuss why did they put why did they set up their schools they had to set up their schools because they had to protect their kids from finding out what the truth is yes it's just like the way they're setting up exactly Carl there's only one reason they're doing it they have to protect them for finding out the truth.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4735s)

Exactly.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4738s)

Exactly what we're saying.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4743s)

And and also giving an avenue for young children to leave because as you listen to people's stories and you hear of people that left when they're 16 or 17 and I'm talking about when we did go to mainstream school a lot of them would contact school friend yeah you know I I know so because they are somebody they've seen on a daily basis who's got a little bit of a clue and the kindly mother or father um yes and you've got to protect the children from that and that's said in inverted commas.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4772s)

Yeah it's it's very true and I I think most people outside the brethren who aren't familiar with the system assume that the brethren have their own schools because they use it for religious teaching and that's not the case they don't they don't they they tried doing bible studies for a few years and then they dropped it.

### [**Carma Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4793s)

Yes yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4794s)

Yeah they can't do that because they...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4796s)

Can't do bible studies because kids will think and they will actually find out what the truth behind the bible is so they can't allow them to do that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4805s)

You know I mean I used to teach bible studies and and some of it some of it was about the bible which was relatively interesting quite a lot of it was a whole series of articles or accounts written about what they call the great conflicts of the recovery which which are kind of made out in sort of fantastical warfare language to be this sort of great conflict between good and evil and these terrible rivals [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4835s) how our beloved brother triumphed.

But when you actually try and write it out and explain it to a bunch of school children what it actually looks remarkably like is two rather arrogant elderly white gentlemen having a big theological argument about who's actually going to run the place. And I think that's why they stopped it, because when you, you know, it's fine to talk in the meeting abstractly about these great conflicts. But when you actually put it in black and white, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4866s) all looks remarkably stupid and narrow minded and pig headed. You know, the eternal son question, was Jesus the son in eternity or not? They all split up about that and thousands and thousands of brethren went off and they fought and argued over that. Who knows the answer and who cares? You know? Yeah.

And the current generation of young people and the brethren are very irreligious, largely. I mean, they wouldn't have a clue about any of this stuff. They're very ill-taught in biblical subjects or the history of Christianity.

They're just little shiny polished businessmen with nice straight side partings.

It was shortly after I left in 92 in Maple Creek, I think it was that next fall or that following year when everybody was pulled out of the schools that that last group of us that left in Maple Creek um or were kicked out um went to homeschooling and then the new schools were built after that so I mean they they didn't they didn't do it for religious studies they did it to to save their kids in their eyes.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4949s)

If you think about it grandpa Symington said we should stay in the school because we were rubbing shoulders with the world. And then all of a sudden, yeah. And then all of a sudden here comes John Hales and he pulls all these kids out. Why? Because they were rubbing shoulders with the world and the world was, you know, teaching them a couple of things to actually, you know, normal things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4973s)

Yeah.

Wow.

Well, Jacky, we sure appreciate you coming on. Yeah was there anything was there anything more you wanted to comment on?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=4987s)

No it's it's it's been good um I as I say I particularly what I want to do is encourage I suppose the but the closing would be encourage anybody that's watching this podcast in the brethren to read that document yeah yeah just read it just read it yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5006s)

Yeah we'll put up links to it make sure it's accessible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5009s)

Start coming up for what you know is to be morally true right there's I think that's the biggest thing for everybody in there is you've got to start thinking for yourself and asking yourself is this my belief does this feel right in my heart because I know there's some really good christians in there right there's some very good compassionate faith-based christians in there and you just got to be able to separate yourself from all of the schisms that are [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5039s) you and start asking yourself does this feel right in my heart you know.

I know I know that my dad had been able to keep his coherence and keep his own mind to himself he was someone that really saw through things he really did compassion was always this thing that he preached on it was that's why he was such a threat to them is because he he his fall made him um a little bit he didn't have a filter on his mouth so [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5069s) just kind of said what he needed to say but a lot of what he came out of his mouth was truth it was just truth and I think that's what everybody needs to do you need to find your own truth right yeah it's it's in here it's not out here it's in your heart.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5085s)

And it's your personal conscience and I would say to people in don't be frightened to believe you've got a voice yeah I mean you said your dad could be outspoken good for him but people are frightened to speak out but even just those questions in your head ask them don't stop yourself asking them because that's the start of actually change whereas I think sometimes even those little niggling doubts your head I mean I call them the thought police will go to that question before you've even when you're in the brethren allow those questions to happen and then see if you can find the answers and as you say do what what's on your moral compass yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5126s)

And change is messy everybody needs to remember that change is messy and that's okay it is so So okay, when you go to re when you go to rebuild your house and you tear it down inside, right, it gets messy. That's what's happening. And that's okay, it is okay, but we're all here for each other.

We might not we don't really know what we're doing on these podcasts, we're winging it. We are not professionals, we've never proclaimed to be professional.

I know there's been a few comments in our presentation. And you know what, we do what we can do. We do.

We allow everybody on here to have their own voice. I am not going to turn into the PBCC and tell somebody else who's on here that they can't say what they need to say or believe what they want to believe. Everybody who comes in and out of here have been affected by the PBCC and everybody is always in a state of feeling. And what I guess I want to ask ex-members and other people who listen to that is have compassion for what we are trying to do, have compassion for the people that come on here and [bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5197s) their vulnerability. It is hard to do what we are doing. It's hard to be vulnerable. I second guess myself every single time we do one of these podcasts.

Please bear with us while we're trying to work out what we're trying to do. Because the first step is allowing us to open up a platform like this. The first step is allowing ourselves to have a voice, find that voice. Some of us are angry some of us are burdened in grief some of us have days that were really good some of us are fighting things that we don't even want to look at so I just think that everybody needs to make a note when they're watching our podcast is you need to have compassion [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5237s) need to allow us a a platform where we can just all be vulnerable and not judge one another I think that's my biggest plea from the last couple of days where that's really what I want to put out there is just this is us being vulnerable and not knowing what we're doing. We're just following our heart.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5258s)

I would totally second that. And what I would add to it, everybody on this podcast that's come through has the PBCC experience in one shape or form. We are also all individuals with different personalities. So how we've reacted to that experience will be different for each and every one of us. And that is okay. Yeah, that's all. That is okay.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOnt8i6tB8&t=5282s)

Couldn't have said it better, Jacky. Thank you so much for coming on. Thank you for having me. At any point in time, you've always got a seat here in this podcast and you have a way to share that beautiful voice of yours. Thank you so much. Thank you, everyone. Take care. Bye. Much love.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
