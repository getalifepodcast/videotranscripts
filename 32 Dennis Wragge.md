## Summary

Dennis Wragge shares his experiences with the so-called "great men" JTJr and JHS. His eyewitness accounts shatter the illusion of perfection that has so been cleverly contrived. You will be shocked by some of the devious and unchristian antics that Dennis is putting on public record for the very first time. We include, at the end of the podcast, an excerpt from JT JR's ministry on his ownership of the women.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=12s)

Hello everyone and welcome to today's episode of Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. Today we'll be talking to Dennis Wragge again. Dennis has been around for many years. He's met a lot of these so-called great men, and I think he has some very interesting memories to share with us. So over to you, Dennis. Tell us some of your experiences with these so-called great men.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=42s)

All right. Well, that's quite an introduction, Richard. But yes, I, well, I'll give you my background story first. I'm probably third or fourth generation brethren. And I can say I had a very, very good childhood. I was a little disadvantaged. My father had been withdrawn from when I was about three years old. And he came back into the meeting when I was about 18\. But that didn't hinder the fact that I enjoyed all the benefits of a young person back in the 50s and 60s. Um, and I would say generally it was a it was a fun time. Um, life centered around going to three-day meetings which if you felt like going you [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=94s) went. You didn't have to get special invitations or anything at all, you just went. 

And uh, as a teenager it was it was a time when you would go to, as a guy, you go there to meet the girls, yeah, and vice versa. And dating was allowed. I went out with lots of different girls, um, and generally was fun. Um, I  like cars. Um, so I had, and it was quite common in those days, um, sports cars. Yeah. I had an MG and then I had a Jaguar, good British cars. My cousin had a Corvette. Yeah. Cousin had a fancy uh, Pontiac convertible. And Bruce Hill had an Austin Healey. And Don Hardwick had an Austin Healey. And Bob Smith had an Austin Healey. And we just had fun. We just had fun. 

And anyway, and we were allowed to travel when we wanted. An interesting little story would be that I had two sisters that were older than I am. And my sister Grace, she went, she was very good, both sisters were good friends of Consuela Taylor. And my sister Grace went on what was common in those days to a [tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=194s) of the UK and in Europe. She and Consuela went off together and had their fun. My sister Grace met an older brother and she very quickly got married to him and moved to Scotland. Yeah. And uh, Consuela, she met a young Australian guy called Bruce Hales. (Bruce Hales Sr) Yes. On the same trip. So they both met older guys and Consuela went off to Australia and the rest is history. Interesting, yeah.

 So that was all interesting and it was just generally, um, an enjoyable time. I, I would say it was a, the brethren were a very good group. Uh, yeah, perhaps strict by some people's standards, but I look back at it [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=249s) a time of great fondness. And I married, don't hold me to figures because I'm terrible on dates. I'd have to get my wife in here and give me the proper dates. But I think I was probably 23 and I married Martha Pittman, George Pittman's daughter, and I think she was 17 when we got married. I think, as they say, don't hold me to dates because I'm bad. And we shortly started to have kids, had five kids and had a really, really happy family. And we threw ourselves wholeheartedly into just... we gave totally of our time, our money, our finances, our affections, our everything. We threw into the meeting in a genuine way. And as a result, the recompense was I got to go to the Levitical meetings. [Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=325s) Levitical meetings?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=327s)

Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=328s)

I, I, I don't know how many years I went consecutively to those and you know, so I was kind of, I wasn't a, I was nowhere near a big time brother, but I was a guy that was around.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=344s)

You had some access to the inner circle so, yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=348s)

Exactly, yes. Um, it was, uh, um, well, and in the course of it I met these great men. Yes. You know what I mean? Yeah. And I've heard that the brethren are supposed to be examining the lifestyle of these great men. Well, exactly. Yeah. I've seen a little bit of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=381s)

So I'm guessing that would start with James Taylor Jr., would it?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=386s)

Yes, it would. But actually, when I was a kid, when I was a kid, went to the big meetings in North America where the Rochester meetings. And as a kid, we were going to Rochester meetings and I was told, look out for Mr. Taylor. That was JT Senior. He was this little speck in the distance up in the platform. So all I can say is I've seen JT Senior. That's all. But I had a fair [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=416s) to do with JTJr. Yes. Um, and uh, um, he knew me, you know, by name. And uh, I had, I was in the same home as him dozens of times. I had meals with him maybe half a dozen times. And I was even in his house once. I was having a little meeting with him. So that's how I know JTJr.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=454s)

So I think you mentioned something about wiretapping. Is that a story about JTJr.?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=462s)

Yes, it is. Yeah. This pure man broke the law. Right. All right. The the story is, um, the brethren in Barbados were concerned about a young, uh, a young wife actually, um, who was causing them trouble, but they couldn't pin anything on her. Yeah. They, uh, so they went to Mr. Taylor and said, we think she's contacting people outside, which is a terrible sin, but we can't pin it on her and she denies it. Yeah. He said, well, stick a wire tap on the telephone line. This is long before, long before cell phones. This is, yeah. Yeah. And they said, well, Mr. Taylor, it's illegal. Yeah. He says, his response, I heard all this from Lyle Lepage. Yes. A local brother in Barbados. Yeah. And, um, they said, uh, well, that's illegal. He said, so what?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=530s)

I see, that goes back a long way. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=533s)

So it goes back a long way. And so he was, Lyle was telling me the story about, it was Ben Corbin, not Birtie, it was Ben Corbin, had to shinny up a telephone pole and he was at the top of the telephone pole, you know, snipping wires and connecting, I don't know how you wiretap, but he was doing it. And uh...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=556s)

I'll show you one day.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=560s)

Don't admit it. Anyway, it was, so uh, anyway, Lyle was at the bottom of the pole and he saw the uh, the van from the local telephone company coming up the street slowly, they're examining, you know, trying to look up the poles what's going on. So hollered up to Ben, get down quick. So Ben, you know, slid down the pole and he hid in the bushes while the uh, telephone truck went past. So they didn't get caught. But the the sister did get caught. She was in contact with somebody outside. So she got kicked out and that the end of that marriage and that was that was [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=609s). Wow. No problem breaking the law.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=612s)

Well, sadly I don't find it hard to believe. Um, you know, but yeah, it's surprising it went back that far. I mean, I thought it was a fairly recent thing, but.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=624s)

No, this would be, this would be back in the early 60s, 1960s, probably '62. Yeah. I, I was raised, and uh, because a couple of years later in Toronto, um, there was a struggle between, um, two brothers, political struggle for who's going to be the top weenie in the city. Yeah. And uh, it was between, um, Roy Devenish [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=655s) uh, Jack Hay. Yep. Anyway, um, somebody got the goods. Jack Heggie was being crooked, doing, doing something bad in his business. Yeah. So, uh, um, on the Saturday morning, Jack Heggie was kicked out for corrupt business practice, but it was a little bit tenuous. 

So it was decided right then and there, um, among, by this time it's a little bit of a, a little bit of a weenie, and uh, about six or seven of us pooled our money to, um, hire a [private](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=699s) detective on Jack Heggie to find something more substantial to nail on him. Yeah, yeah. So it was a waste of money. I think the guy was a bit slippery, but so be it. The detective came back and had nothing against him. He wasn't having an affair. He wasn't fooling around. He wasn't doing anything bad. So it was money down the drain. And uh, anyway, that was just another time I felt okay to give money to it because I knew uh, the great man had approved of it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=743s)

Yes. Yeah. So it was a case of uh, withdraw from him first and then find a reason to later, more or less.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=749s)

Yes. Yeah. It was. And and it's a system where if the great man says it's okay, you don't have to have a moral conscience about anything.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=763s)

Oh, exactly. Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=766s)

You deal with impunity. Yeah. So anyway, have you ever heard of the vindictive line?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=776s)

Rhyme? No.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=778s)

Line.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=779s)

Oh, yeah, the line. Yeah, about the, about the Hales brothers.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=782s)

Well, yeah, what actually happened was, um, in uh, you know, the end of 1965, about October, JTJr. came down really hard on that whole system. And, um, he, he just, he called it the commercial line. He called it the hard line. And he was really, really, really tough on it. And he encouraged every [local](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=813s) meeting to purge out the bad stuff. Yes. Now, John Hales, Bruce Hales and uh, Alan Gadsden in Australia were all kicked out. In North America, Roy Devenish, the guy I just mentioned, and a guy I think out in Vancouver also got booted out. I'm not sure about England. I, I think there were maybe a few of them too. But they were all booted out. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=843s) then the underlings then had to every Tuesday night confess their sins. Yeah. Their involvement. And somebody of this little group that had contributed to the detective thing, where somebody squealed. 

And we had to go out on the Tuesday night and humbly confess that we had contributed to this wicked, wicked wickedness of hiring a detective. It was brutal. And we had little kids at the time and my wife was out that night on the Tuesday night and I was still at home. So she came home, says, whoa, you got a big, you know, you're in a pretty deep crap, guy, here ... And uh, um, it was, it was brutal. It was, it was the closest I came to really getting booted out because people were so [irate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=909s) around Toronto that such a thing had been done.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=913s)

Yes. Yeah. But of course you couldn't say, well, actually, we were told to do it by the next layer up, because then you'd have been in even worse trouble.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=924s)

Well, actually it wasn't even passed by JTJr. I want to be, I don't want to pin that on him. It was just done. And I was free to participate because like the guys in the Nuremberg trials, if Himmler said yeah, you're free. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't have to worry about your conscience.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=947s)

Yes, yes.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=947s)

And it's exactly the same philosophy of any dictatorial system. It was, you know, it was, it was bad.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=957s)

The leaders were the example. So if you were doing what they were doing, then that was fine. That was the only moral standard you had.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=964s)

Exactly.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=966s)

Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=967s)

Then that was 1965\. And um, I don't know how, I understand nowadays they're trying to overthrow the fact that JTJr. was so against it, but I can tell you he was big time. Yes. Then skip on to 1970\. You want to hear my experience of '70?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=992s)

Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=996s)

Well, there was Mr. Jim. I, I, I, I was totally in love with Mr. Jim, okay? I, I'm saying that. And, um, uh, he was very, very charismatic and yet you, I was in awe of the man too. It was combined with fear. Anyway, um, I got a phone call saying that he, Stanley McCallum had turned [against](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1026s) our beloved. Yes. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. And uh, anyway, so I, I immediately, I phoned up Garth McCallum. Yeah. That's his, Stanley's son, that I was very, I was, Garth and I were good friends. I was his best man at his wedding. Yeah. I said, Garth, has your dad turned against Mr. Jim? And he said, no. And I said, well, I heard this, but I didn't want to say anything because I might spread a terrible rumor. Anyway, Garth called me back probably 30 minutes later in tears and say, I'm afraid it's true. And it was, it was turmoil. Like it was totally throwing our, our life upside down. It was, it was an awful experience. 

And then my older sister, not the one that went with Consuela on the trip, but the older sister, I have two sisters, she had married Roger Parker. Yes. The son of Buffton Parker, who was probably the number two man in New York City. Yes. And anyway, Roger phoned me up one night, I don't know when it was, and said, Mr. Taylor had phoned up his, Buffton Parker, and had withdrawn from him over the telephone. Yes. Like that, cut them off. And Roger was upset, of course, but at that point I was totally supportive of Mr. Jim and saying, you know, I, I tried to calm Roger down. Yeah. And then a couple of weeks later, um, somehow we got it, I, I don't know why it happened, it just happened, got in our heads to uh, put the kids in the car and my wife and I, we drove to New York City. 

Yeah. And to stay with Roger and Audrey. And, um, went out to the meeting on Saturday morning and it just at Nostrand Avenue. And as the meeting started, Billy Peterson picked up the microphone, said, there's new, something, new information has come to light about Mr. Taylor. Yes. Mr. Taylor just turned and said, uh, you're a wicked man, Billy, I withdraw from you. And you know, and it just, it was just an uproar. It was chaos. And Mr. Taylor got up out of his chair and said, uh, those that withdraw from iniquity, follow me. So [anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1215s), I, I, I, I and, you know, quite a few others got up and we went to the back of the Nostrand Avenue meeting room. And uh, they were just yelling and screaming and hollering and crying. And it was awful. It was, you've been there, you know, it was awful. Yeah. Yeah. Remember standing around the back and then, um, girls then stayed, stayed inside with Billy and [uh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1245s) I gather somebody went and turned the lights out. So the room was pitch black. And then somebody else yelling out, we've got the light here, we don't need those. It was, it was crazy. It was, it was crazy.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1260s)

Wow.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1260s)

It was just crazy. That's all. As Mr. Taylor had gone home, I think, I think Pete McGregor drove him home. Yes. Uh, the rest of us milled around and to me, it's been a daze. I can't remember all of it. Uh, and, um, anyway, on the Monday, I don't know where I got the balls to do it, I phoned up Mr. Taylor, said, can I come to visit you? Yeah. So Martha and I drove over to his house and uh, we spent a morning with just Mr. and Mrs. Taylor and Martha and I. Yes. Yeah. Which was, it was quite an honor in some ways. You know, I'm talking in brethren talk. Yeah. And uh, we sat there. Um, he ordered Renee, his wife, to go get these guys a drink. And, and we all had a drink of scotch. And he rambled on about everything. Yeah. It was, he just rambled on. And I say, I've been at meals with him. He was the most entertaining guy to have a meal with. He would just ramble on. His wit was unbelievably, he was super funny. And he was that kind of a person, just entertaining to be around. 

Anyway, this morning he just talked about people, um, here, there and everywhere. Um, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1371s) uh, made observations that were in my opinion quite insightful about people. And then he freely admitted to having fondled women. He, there was the one that kind of brought it to a head was uh, I think her name was Judy Walker, local in New York City, who had married a guy and moved to South Africa. Yeah. And she had big boobs. Okay. She was, she was very well endowed. 

And is, I, I, the story I heard, I wasn't there, but there was a bunch of brethren sitting around in the living room of somebody's house and he had her sitting beside him or on his knee or something. And he was just rubbing these big boobs and quite enjoying themselves. Wow. Yeah. And uh, my sister, she [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1445s) already told us that uh, after one meeting, he had been talking with her and he had done the same with her. Um, and uh, his explanation was, all these people are making a fuss of me just showing affection to my, you know, a sister I love. That was his reasoning, that it was okay for him to do it because he loved these ladies.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1476s)

Wow. So he was doing this quite publicly. This wasn't done behind closed doors.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1481s)

It wasn't done publicly. It wasn't done privately. No, it was done publicly. And I remember driving over there with Martha and the two of us say, what do we do if he does it to you? And I, I don't think we came to a conclusion. We'll just, we'll play it by ear. But yeah, it wasn't right. Yeah. But he was a man of God. And is the Lord telling [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1511s) to feel my wife up? It was a dilemma.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1517s)

Wow. I think it's what they call cognitive dissonance, where you, where you have to simultaneously believe two things that are contradictory. And uh, you know, that that almost sums up the brethren, is that you have to believe things that you simultaneously know not to be true. So, but uh, you know...

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1539s)

You have to suppress, you have to suppress it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1542s)

Yeah, and you're trained to suppress it.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1545s)

Yeah, exactly. Now he, he uh, he made no advances on, uh, and actually we walked into the living room and up to that point, um, since some meetings in Rochester I was at, uh, the brother and the brothers used to have to kiss each other. So whenever we had, brothers used to have to kiss, yeah. So we walked in the room and went over to give him a kiss. This is just a little anecdote thing. Yeah. [He](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1575s) just put his hand up like this, says, pow, like an Indian. He says, no more of that stuff. I say, that was, that was the end of the kissing thing.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1585s)

I see. I guess you weren't too sorry.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1588s)

Well, it was, it just had become so, you know, when I came back to Toronto, the first meeting I went to, people were coming up to me and, you know, to give me the great big hug and the kiss. And I just had to talk with a great man. So that was, that was what I saw. That's fascinating. And uh, it started at some meetings I was at in Rochester, used to have them in uh, one of the old-fashioned meeting rooms with a platform and you know, so on. And he got a, he got a black brother there, I think from Boston, called him up to the front. And he, he could just, he had a special way of talking. And he got some guy from, I think he was from Cincinnati, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1643s) which is kind of getting close to the, well, it's below the Mason-Dixon line. Yeah, yeah. I guess he, like, he knew the brother, and he got this old guy up there and says, come, come on up here. And he got the two of them had to kiss each other. 

Yeah. Which, yeah, anyway, that's a little silly story. But, um, that all that splitting stuff was chaotic. And uh, uh, Bill Peterson was, he's a lot older than I was, but he was a good friend. And uh, I mean, others would know better than I would about Mr. Jim as far as personal, like Margaret Peterson, Margaret Wilson, I guess now, lives in England.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1697s)

Yes, Guy Wilson's wife. Yes.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1699s)

That's right. Anyway, Bill used to always come and stay at our house and doing business whenever he's in Toronto. And, um, anyway, after Aberdeen, he started phoning me two, three times a day. Often, just, it got to be, at first it was exciting to be on the in. Yeah. He was like a scorekeeper command center. Yeah. He would come [up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1729s) and say, uh, oh, uh, Percy Maran is holding uh, Indianapolis is strong. But Dean Mills out in Los Angeles, he's wavering, he's weak. We're going to lose Los Angeles. It was amazing. But Alan Price, he's holding the UK together. Joe Pollock in Montreal, it's rock solid. And Billy was going on and on and on like every day.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1755s)

Sort of like election night on the television.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1757s)

Totally. And then it was kind of, at the beginning it was fun, but after a while it got a little bit like, come on. But then he was the one that finally turned on his uncle Jim and said, we found out more stuff about him and we got to deal with it. So, anyway, those are silly little stories about these great men.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1787s)

Yes. You mentioned something about, um, smear campaign against Stanley McCallum.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1794s)

Oh, that was nasty. That was, that was, that was downright... anyway, um, after Aberdeen, suddenly out of the blue, um, um, Stanley was a pedophile. And I knew Mr. McCallum. I'd stayed in their house many, many times and been on trips with him. And I mean, I can't say something is categorically false, but all I can say is he certainly never made a pass at me and he's always very fatherly and a nice guy. And [supposedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1844s) he did something inappropriate with two Brown boys on the way to fellowship meetings in Montreal. And uh, the evil offense took place in Ontario, you know, going from Detroit to Montreal, and you have to go through Ontario. Yeah. And um, so anyway, I got a call from John McCallum, who had been out of the fellowship for many years. Um, be Garth's little bit older brother. And uh, and John McCallum had left the meeting when he's a teenager. And he and his father, I mean, that was the end of it. Anyway, after all this smear campaign about Stanley, John, who had now become a lawyer and worked in Washington for the government, he came up to Windsor, Ontario, and he went to the provincial police and asked what they had on his father. 

And this is hearsay on my part, but John told [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1924s) that the police told him that they had nothing. They had investigated it thoroughly and they had nothing against Stanley McCallum. And then they had finally put an end to it when they told the brethren from Detroit who kept pestering them to prosecute, prosecute, uh, that they would charge them with wrongful prosecution. That uh, according to John, that was the only way they could get the brethren in Detroit to stop pestering the police.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1961s)

Wow, that's very interesting because it sounds very like what happened to Lance Christie where the Brethren managed to get 40 or 50 police officers involved and managed to get Lance, you know, they actually got him into court, accused him of harassment and when it gets to court the judge just throws it all out. He says it's utterly ridiculous, this is two emails, you didn't even need to open them. But the Brethren have put so much pressure on the police that [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1991s) police kind of just put it through to get a little peace I suppose. But yes, the same tactic.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=1997s)

Well, it's terrible. And uh, Stanley McCallum died a broken man. He, he had been the number two guy in the world and a very, very affable guy. I could see him. He took a real big interest in young people.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2029s)

That's okay. I'm just going to show a picture of how close Stanley McCallum and um, JT Jr. were.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2037s)

Yeah, yeah, there he is. Sure. He was a neat guy. That's Bruce Hales as well, I think. This is, I guess Bruce Hales.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2047s)

Bruce Hales Senior, yeah. Yeah, I think it is, yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2050s)

Yeah. And and uh, No, that's, yeah, that's, I know him really well. Yeah. And, okay, that was neat, Cheryl. Wow, you're a bit computer literate. I know. That was bad luck that time. Yeah. Wow. Anyway, that's a story with him. And he's gone, and I would, until somebody proves otherwise, I would hold him in high esteem. He was very, very kind to me.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2094s)

We heard a very interesting story about him that will be, that will actually be on our Aberdeen podcast, which I think will come out before this one. And that is that Garth McCallum got a phone call from John Hales when they were revising the hymn book. And John Hales was talking about putting some of Stanley McCallum's hymns back in the hymn book. Now that, they didn't actually do that, but that suggested that John Hales knew that he was innocent because he certainly wouldn't have proposed putting his hymns back in the book if it hadn't been so. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2133s)

Yeah, Bradley told me that.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2135s)

Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2136s)

Yeah, that's, that's amazing. That's amazing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2139s)

So have you ever met Mr. Symington?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2144s)

Oh, yeah. Okay, Carman, sorry about this. Yeah, I first met JHS... well, Garth McCallum and I went out on a trip looking at the girls out west. And uh, we ended up in Neche and Garth met Dorothy, his wife was from St. Vincent. But anyway, on the trip, um, I think we stayed, Carmen, it was your great-great-grandfather, Lyle? Yep. Lyle and Ida? Yes, okay. Yeah. Well, Garth and I stayed at their house and he was quite a character. Yeah. And we went out to the farm and we saw, you know, JHS harvesting. It must have been in August. And he, everybody else had these self-driving combines. His combine was pulled behind a tractor, which is, and I [remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2212s) being there and this stupid thing kept jamming up on him. And I've got a picture of him with his head buried up, you know, trying to free this stupid combine. You know, I don't remember him saying a bad word, but I sure would have. And it was blistering hot. And the women brought the food out. We sat in the shade of the truck and and had our meal. And he's a very soft-spoken, he is a really, [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2243s) attractive man. And then I think I was at Neche the following year and went around to the farm again. And he was showing me around the farm and he had, what do you call it, a herd of pigs? A herd, are they called herds?

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2266s)

I think they're called a congregation. Well, okay, whatever.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2270s)

I felt some meaning of herds, of pigs. Anyway, and we were standing there looking at this pig pen with, I don't know, 50 or 80 little pigs in the pen. And all of them had their snouts came out, and then they took a right-angle turn. Apparently, it was some kind of a contagious disease that pigs get.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2298s)

Yep. It's called rhinitis. Okay.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2301s)

Look, his pigs had it.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2303s)

Mine's a bit like that.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2308s)

Well, and apparently the only way to get rid of it in those days was you had to put them all down because they couldn't eat and they were all little runts and they were kind of useless.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2318s)

Yeah, and you had to literally burn the, the manure and everything to get it, um, sterile to bring in new pigs. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2326s)

Really? Now, does the government cover the cost of that? I don't know. I don't know. I got the impression, he didn't say much, but I got the impression that that this was financially devastating and he wasn't in the best shape financially compared to some of the other farmers out there. Yeah. I, I don't, I don't, I, I just, that's my observation that things were tough. Yeah. And he had, you know, five boys and, uh, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2363s) know, and a lovely wife, by the way. Oh, she is the most, Trissie's most lovely, lovely lady. Yeah. Anyway, that's kind of just, you know, a little anecdote about these great men. Yeah. Skip on to many years later, and I used to charter airplanes to go to all these fellowship meetings internationally, nationally. And every month they used to charter planes to go to Neche. And part of my job was to make sure everybody was on the bus to go back to Winnipeg. So the farmhouse, the Symingtons' house was right next door to the meeting room. And so I used to, as time was getting late and the buses were still waiting, I would go in there to stand in the back stairs to see if anybody from our group was still [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2434s) consulting with Mr. Symington. And he was a very different man once he was a big leader.

Like, I would hear him in the, I was in the back stairs, but he'd be in the living room and just yelling at people, belittling them. I mean, making snap judgments of kicking people out with no regard whatsoever the [consequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2464s) of what would do to their family, their business, their life, their everything. He would just pronounce, get rid of them. And I can still hear just yelling at people. And I'd see these brothers coming out, just sometimes crying because he had been so nasty and hard on them. It was, he used to break my heart. It was awful. And [compared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2494s) to some of the things I've seen about the Hales’.

 I, Carmen, you should describe the house. You can do it better than I can. But I, I know in the kitchen it was just that old-fashioned linoleum and, uh, there's a just a crappy little kitchen table and he used to sit in a, uh, an office chair on coasters at the kitchen table. And the linoleum floor was all worn away and it was pretty, [pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2525s) minimal as compared to the ostentatious crap today. Yeah. And in his, uh, in the living room, he had this kind of lounge, lazy boy chair. And he had a couch. I remember the couch was, one of the legs was broken on the couch and he had a couple of magazines or books or something holding up the couch at one end because the leg was broken. Is that right?

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2552s)

A couple chunks of two-by-four.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2554s)

Oh, yeah. That's what it was, yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2556s)

Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2558s)

I mean, he was great in the sense of he sure wasn't into that, the kind of crap that's out there today. Yeah. And uh, I can say about, you know, Mr. Jim's house too, it was, it was a beautiful, like great huge old house, but uh, on the, on the man, I don't know if it was on the mantel on the piano or what it was, the little statue saying, “Sue the bastards.”

 It's a kind of a [famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2588s) little statuette that was. Anyway, but, you know, Mr. Symington was pretty, uh, simple in the way he lived. Yeah. And uh, but oh, he was tough. He, he could, he could make pronouncements based on one witness, because there wouldn't be two guys there giving witness, which is against scriptural, scripture. But he would, he would pronounce these devastating judgments on people, just like, and just hollering at people and, yeah, it didn't seem very Christ-like to me. No.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2630s)

Yeah, I can totally, totally back you, give you a second, um, that's, that's exactly what I remember too. Okay. You could prove that something was wrong. Like he got information from Jim Bob and he would find out that it was wrong, but he would always go back to the same guys again, even though they had given him wrong information the first time. It was like he had certain people that he always talked to and it just got him in trouble.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2660s)

Oh, and it was, it was, well, it wasn't, it wasn't biblical. Yeah. Like, I mean, who am I to say? I'm no scholar, but it just wasn't right. Yeah. And and the devastation that it was causing, it wasn't just like a slap on the wrist. It was people's lives were destroyed. Yeah. On, on the basis of one guy. And let's face it, it's a very, very political system. So if you can, you know, say something bad about somebody else and he'll believe you, you're, the other guy's screwed. He's out. Yeah. And uh, it was awful.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2702s)

Yeah. And I don't remember hearing very many cases where he ever accepted the second side of a story.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2709s)

No, you didn't. You didn't dare. No. And, um, another... well, and, and, you know, to, if I'm trying to pin, uh, am I frozen again? Oh, no, you're good. No, you're good. Okay. Cheryl's just looking at me like she's frozen. Like a little thing, this is this, I'm not making a big deal of it. But there's one time that he was passing through Toronto airport, which he did a lot. And he sat in the middle of the concourse with, you know, thousands of people walking, spilling around him. And he, I'm looking for something here on my desk. He had, do you see that? He had somebody poured him a glass of scotch, probably that much. And he sat there drinking it in public. Wow. Yeah. Like, I'm not, it's not a big deal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2782s)

It is, though, because I mean, alcoholism is so huge in there. And this just shows you that they just didn't care where they did it.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2790s)

Yeah. Yeah. It just wasn't right. Like, it's, it, you're not supposed to drink in public. You know, have I done it? Yeah, a few others on this, but not like that. And then that was, that was like, I've done it in, uh, I'm at a parent or something, but so I'm not pure either. And I don't want to make anything but...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2813s)

Yeah, but you're also not sitting in the elective vessel, Man of God throne.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2819s)

No, I'm not. I'm not. Anyway, I was going to say, oh, well, okay, another little nasty thing. This is really to my shame, but this is early on, back probably just when he was starting to take over as being the the universal leader. I was involved in a case of a husband had been withdrawn from and I was, you know, helping the wife a little bit. And back in Mr. Taylor's time, it was always, we're just drummed into us, we don't tell women what to do. In other words, we don't tell them to leave their husbands. Right. Which was, and everybody knew it. And so anyway, I had a little private session with JHS and I told him I, I had a problem with being so blatant, lying. And uh, he looked at me with those eyes. Carmen, do you know those eyes?

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2903s)

Yeah, yeah, I know exactly.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2906s)

He looked at me and says, what would you suggest? You know, put me on the spot. Yeah. And I said, rather than saying we don't tell women what to do, maybe it's a better way to say that the husband and wife had a happy life in the brethren, and he's the guy that left. It's not, she hasn't left him. He's left her. He's left the way of life. He's the one that's turned his back on the life that they enjoyed. And unfortunately, that has become the way the brethren operate, is to, when the husband leaves, they start up a smear campaign that the husband is the... and they say the wicked, lying, nasty. I mean, I'm, yeah, I'm the product of what I kind of suggested. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2964s)

Wow. You don't realize when you're in there what you're under and the influence that you're under and why you say what you say, right? It's, it's not until you get out and you get your head above the clouds and look back on it where you realize, wow, I can't believe I was in that and doing that.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2981s)

Exactly. Like it took me, it took me years, Cheryl, like it took me years and years and years and years, and I'm still seeing that. And but it took me years to see that that's not Christianity.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=2998s)

You know, it's funny, I got a message today, I'm going to read part of it. It fits right into here. It's part of Bruce's new ministry and what he's been teaching. I just have to find it here.

 Okay. So I'm just going to read this. The first one was said, so there's two new things that are new ministry and not sure if this person wasn't sure if they're in print or not. But anyhow, the first one was said by Bruce, BDH, privately in the house at levitical meetings in 2020 was shortly before I left and I was told by someone who was in the house with him at the time. He said there are three levels in hell. The first level is your average sinner and unbeliever. The second level is [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3045s) the really evil people, example are Hitler, serial killers, etc. Finally, the third deepest and worst level is reserved for opposers of the testimony.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3056s)

Are you, oh my goodness, that's so juvenile.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3063s)

We're now categorizing this, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3065s)

That's fine. Oh, wow. So when we're, when when we get there, we'll have to be careful not to walk around late at night or we might wake him up down below, might we? We're in level four. You'll hear him thumping on the ceiling, keep one up there, from asleep.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3087s)

Yeah. Wow. That's childish. I think it's just...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3094s)

Insane. It's just insane, the levels that he goes to. It's just, yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3098s)

Extreme. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3101s)

Yeah. What a goof. Anyway, I, I did meet him once. I, uh, I met him at Bristol one year and I was standing there. I didn't know who the goof was, but we were standing there talking and a bunch of these…on Sunday, they used to have all the girls that had been helping out in the house would come on the Sunday. And there were all these girls running around. Actually, my recollection is he's a fairly good-looking guy, but I don't know, um, I, you know, this is years, you know, umpteen years ago, but he's put on a lot of weight. Yeah. And anyway, these silly little girls all came up and, you know, what's your name? And uh, I said my name and they couldn't care less. And then, uh, what's your name? Bruce Hales. And in those days, Bruce Hales was W.B.H.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3163s)

Oh, you're talking Bruce Hales senior, right? Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. Got you. Yeah. And so these girls all, ha ha ha, they thought it was funny and says, yeah, and told me, uh, you know, I, I, because he had an Australian accent and they thought the girls thought he was pulling their leg. Yeah. Yeah. He told me he was Percy Lion. That's the only time I ever met him. Wow. Yeah. And uh, anyway, that's it. But that's, that's my recollection of these great men. Yeah. It's maybe a little different than what...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3204s)

What was been presented at the Sydney seminar this year, I think. Yeah, your account was very different than what was...

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3212s)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, uh, it took me years and, you know, my impression of JT Jr., he was a great guy. I loved him. But, uh, something happened. I certainly can't condone his behavior, uh, that I saw. And, um, all this stuff in Aberdeen, it's stretching the limits to think that Jesus or Paul or anybody would behave like an idiot. Uh, I think he was probably, you know, something that popped in his brain. I, I, I certainly wouldn't want to, I'm an old guy myself now and I wouldn't, I don't want to emulate that. That's all I can say. I don't want to emulate it. It's not, this is my standard.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3265s)

I've heard some people describe it that there were kind of two different Mr. Taylors. He could quite suddenly flip into a different mode and say very nasty things and behave badly, and at other times he would be very charming. Even reading through his book of letters, you get a lot of letters that are very grammatical and well written, and then you'll suddenly get these letters that are almost nonsensical and abusive. I just wonder whether it was simply the difference between whether he was sober and whether he wasn't.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3301s)

I'd like to read you a letter. Okay. I'll give you the background first. Okay. There was, um, a guy in Toronto who's, without being insulting, but he was a simple guy. He worked in a factory and, uh, um, they, you know, they had four kids and they, they had their struggles, but they, they got through. But he was known to be, uh, say silly things at times. Anyway, he, uh, they owned a house and, you know, he provided in a decent way. Anyway, um, he came to, he, he nursed his wife while she had cancer. And I don't know if the details I'm giving are exactly accurate, but she died. And then he got kicked out.

 Okay. So here's a letter here I got. It just shows the spirit of things. It's written by a lawyer to this poor fellow, and it scared the crap out of him. So that's why he came to me. 

And I act on behalf of your son, blank, blank, blank. I enclose here with a copy of your wife's will for your reference. I'm informed that you have left the fellowship and therefore you are no longer qualified to be the executor based on the conditions imposed in your wife's will. As the alternate executor is so-and-so, that's the son, for this purpose, he requires all information that you may have with respect to the assets owned by your wife. Would you please provide this information to me as soon as conveniently possible? 

They were going to be taking this guy's house that he had worked all his life to get. And they're going to try and take that and all his odds as all other assets or something like that. Yeah. All the assets owned by your wife. That's crazy. Isn't that wicked? Yeah. 

**Carman Drever**

Like, I don't know where they get the idea that that's righteous.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3465s)

Oh and I've got a copy of the wife's will and it says there as long as you're in fellowship with, you know, Symington, Hales and I don't know how many, how far, but it just, that kind of stuff is awful. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why that's, I'd like to come in this podcast just to expose the the awfulness of what good people are doing because I know the son really well. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3496s) he's a decent guy. I mean, totally decent guy, but he had to go to a lawyer to get, write this letter that they say scared the crap out of the old man.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3511s)

Not only destroyed the guy's family, but then want to take everything that he had too. Yeah. You know, it's not enough that you took his whole life.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3522s)

Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3525s)

Yeah. They've got to have no fear of God to do stuff like that.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3530s)

Well, it's getting to that point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think Carmen is getting to that point.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3537s)

Yeah. And yet they, you're forgetting that that's who they meet in the end. Yeah. You know, if they leave all this stuff un, unconfessed and unfixed and and in an unrighteous state, somebody's going to answer for it.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3554s)

All these deeds will have to go accountable for it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I think personally, I think one of the big things that took us off the rails was when, um, when babies became, like, there was babies were automatically in fellowship. And we then wasn't a big step to say that as long as you're in fellowship, you're saved and you have, you don't have to have a connection with the Lord Jesus. Yeah. I think that's, that was a huge thing off the rails.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3596s)

Yeah, and that was what, 1961 or something?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3600s)

I was, it was about '64. I don't think, I, I, I'm just going by the age of my kids. Yeah. Yeah. And at the time it bothered me because I had that...

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3615s)

That one has been used, that one's been weaponized to the point where it's made people think that they have to stay in fellowship in order to be saved.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3624s)

Yes.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3626s)

And that's not right. That's not right teaching. That's not, that's not what is meant.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3631s)

No. Okay. So this takes me to, this takes me to the second part of this this message that I got today. The second thing is something I've been told a few times by my family since I left. I have asked a few others about it. It seems to be new teaching because nobody seems to have heard about it before, apparently. So I have been told, even if I manage to be saved, I will not be in the same heaven as them because the brethren will have their own special heaven. 

This has caused a lot of distress in our house [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3662s) my sister told my daughter that even if your mother is saved, if she died tomorrow, you would never see her again. And in this case, the daughter is underage, so she's not shut up, right? Like it's like this is, they're telling this to little kids. That is like... it's just so, it's so corrupt in there, so corrupt in there. It's, I, I this week has just been, as this last whatever how many days, I know I say that every podcast, but every week is just gets more intense. I'm like, it's so evil in there. It is so evil in there, what they're doing and what they're brainwashing people with now. It's just, it's absolutely absurd.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3706s)

Well, Cheryl, I, I can back up that scene. I, I had an absolutely miraculous time. We, we used to have a motor home and we're heading out to, uh, Stewart and Rose Symington's to get a little bit of a paint job done on the motor home and it broke down inside Neche. To make a long story short, we got stuck in Neche for about three weeks. And uh, while we were there, um, [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3737s) was fellowship meetings going on. So we had taken behind the motorhome, I had a trailer with a motorcycle in it. So Marion and I took the motorcycle up to Neche and I drove around Neche on the motorcycle. I saw all these cars from out of state. And my daughter, Sarah, had married a Hughes from Neche, but now they lived in Gothenburg, Nebraska. So I pulled up beside it far from Nebraska and I said, is Mike and Sarah [Hughes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3773s) in town? Oh yeah, they're staying over at Stanley Hughes. Do you remember these names? Okay, so I went over to Stanley Hughes' house, rapped on the side door, and Lois came to the door. And I said, hi, Lois. And she had a big smile on her face. Hello. And I said, I'm Dennis Wragge. And she's... and I said, from here, I see, I looked in, see Sarah.

 Oh, she'll know not to speak to you. You're out. I said, well, no. I, I still would like to hear that from, anyway, uh, the upshot of it was, um, Sarah came to the door and she said, hi dad. And uh, she said, this is amazing, that my oldest daughter Kathy, who lives in Barbados, was there for supper that night. Wow. From Barbados. So that Kathy and her husband and Kathy's two daughters and Sarah and her family were all there. So they all came out in the side yard and some other people were staying there. I don't know who they were. So there's about 25 or so people all in a semicircle around. And Stanley Hughes, do you remember Stanley? Yeah. That, okay. Well, yeah, of course, Carmen, you would anyway. 

Stanley was there and he very solemnly, um, said, Dennis, we'd love to see you recovered. And uh, you, you've got to realize that there's a special place for you among the saints, uh, at the rapture. And he kept going on about this special place if I was happened to be recovered in [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3900s) before the rapture. And I, I, I just turned to Stan, I said, Stanley, I'm here to see my daughters and their family, but I just can't let that stand. That is not doctrinally right. You've got all these young people here. That is not the truth of scripture. It's by grace you're saved and that not of yourself. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3931s) by grace alone. And you know that no one can boast. It's not a matter of position. It's who you believe in, who you trust. Oh, no. And anyway, he was strong on it that there was a special place for me if I was in the brethren, who have a special place in heaven. And I, I was talking to Jimmy DeSeyn afterwards, who used to do three-day meetings, I understand. Yeah, yeah. Jimmy said, yeah, he used to teach that in the brethren. That's their teaching. Like this is...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3970s)

Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3972s)

It's, it's as if heaven isn't good enough for them. They have to invent a special place in heaven just to make it even better, you know.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3981s)

Yeah, talk about...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3983s)

...icing on the cake.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=3984s)

It's so evil though. I mean, yeah, it's, it's one thing what, you know, what happened to all of us in, in the sense of the hurt of split families, which is terrible. But it's a doctrine that is being shoved into these young people. It is, is, is, it's just not the grace of the gospel.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4007s)

Absolutely not.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4009s)

Yeah.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4009s)

Yeah. Yeah. That's what leads me to believe, I just wonder, do they have no fear? Because everyone that preaches that doctrine, that preaches it knowing it's not true, will be held accountable for every soul they've misled with that doctrine.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4027s)

It's better a millstone they put around their head. Isn't that what it says? Yep.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4031s)

Yep. And a millstone, for anybody who wants to know, is a 3,000 pound stone that has a little hole in the middle. And if it's hung around your neck, you ain't coming back up. I promise.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4043s)

Yeah. It's very graphic, but it's true.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4049s)

It's true.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4050s)

And that's what...

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4052s)

He said if you mislead one…and some of these guys that have gotten up and preached this and misled, you know, a group of 500 people, I mean, how many young people in that could they have misled? And if that's what he says is going to happen for one, imagine where that leaves some of these guys. They have to be not thinking.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4077s)

I think Bruce's head is too big to fit through the hole though.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4083s)

It doesn't need to. We can put a string through it. I promise there's a way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4088s)

We'll find a way.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4089s)

Yeah. God will find a way.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4091s)

God will find a way. Well, if you can get a camel through the eye of a needle, you can get Bruce's head through a millstone, I reckon.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4097s)

Amen. It's God we have to deal with. I mean, yeah, we're all imperfect people and these great men were imperfect people. They had their, you know, okay sides and there they had their nasty, nasty sides and, yeah, just be honest and let's admit it. Yeah. Yeah. That's all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4122s)

You know, I want to dive into some stuff that I know you have some information on with, you've got some happenings with Chipeur a little bit. You've got some inside information withChipeur, don't you? Can you go into that today or no?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4135s)

I, I can, I can do it. Yeah. Uh, Chipeur, the, uh, the big time lawyer in Calgary.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4143s)

Yeah. So Gerald Chipeur is the PBCC's lawyer. Obviously through the Klondike papers, we've heard a lot of Gerald Chipeur and, um, his dealings with the brethren. And I know you've, and I, sorry to put you on the spot, but I, I do. I think it's really important that we bring it forward and kind of, you know, show how the brethren use him.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4169s)

Well, all I can, some of it is hearsay, but I think it's pretty close to the source. There was a case I was involved in and somebody probably in his office, I'm assuming, were pissed off with the evilness of what was going on, and they leaked a whole pile of papers in which I got, I received copies of the leak, um, within probably 30 minutes of them, you know, being released. And uh, I, I'm assuming, and I don't even know this for a fact, but I'm assuming that, um, there was a an [NDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4222s), non-disclosure agreement with the person that they ended up with. Yeah. That was signed a long time after I had seen them. So I don't, I didn't sign you, I didn't see, see and then I didn't sign an NDA. 

And uh, the person that signed it in good faith, you know, whether he... anyway, um, and in these papers, one of the things was fighting over children. And there's scheming involved. And in the document, it talks about Chipeur being in contact with Sydney. Yeah. I don't say who, just says Sydney, um, to scheme to get the children. It was a custody case. Get the children out of this country into another country so they're out of reach of the father.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4276s)

Wow. And this would have been in what sort of year roughly? Would this have been after 2000?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4285s)

Yeah, this would be probably 10 years ago.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4287s)

Okay, so this is in Bruce Hales' time.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4290s)

Oh yes, yeah, definitely. I would say at the most 10 years. And what has happened is, um, there was a huge lot of court battles and, um, I had, I had, well, it was a father that I was in contact with. I'll go that far. I don't want to say much more, but it was a father. And I said, this will never go to court. The brethren rarely go to court because they'll lose in court. But what they do is they bleed you dry as much as they can. I had a court case with them and in one day, I had five different, um, [motions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4339s) they called. You submit papers and then they file a motion objecting to a word in the papers I filed. And they might then file another motion the next day. And every time there's a motion is, you know, five thousand dollars. 

Yes. And it was just motion after motion after motion after motion after motion. And fortunately in my case, the, um, the judge saw what was going on. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4372s) uh, he assigned both parties to go into judge's chambers, got another judge to do it, who tried to mediate the settlement. And we came to the settlement and uh, in the judge's chambers, and they were all day fighting back and forth with like, there's two lawyers and Martha and myself. And, um, we came to an agreement. And then the next morning we're there to sign the papers in front of the judge and Martha said, I can't sign it. She'd obviously got counsel.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4414s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4416s)

You know, that's the word they use. And I'll tell you, the judge literally exploded. Literally exploded. So they did sign the papers agreeing that I had one boy with me and one boy was with Martha and that the boys would alternate back and forth. What they did, they stalled and stalled and then they used that time to totally poison Neil. Yeah. And, um, so he would send me, rather than him showing up at my house, another brother would show up at my house with a note from Neil written on toilet paper saying, uh, with a little drawing, you're a pig, your house stinks, you're wicked, you're evil, I'm not coming. And if you saw the podcast, you heard me on the podcast being just awful for their...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4483s)

For viewers and listeners, Neil's your son, right?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4485s)

Neil is my youngest son.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4487s)

Yeah. And so there's a, there's a documentary out called Breaking Brethren. I'll attach the link to it underneath this podcast for those that are wanting to know more about Dennis's, um, story, personal story. I will attach it to the, this is the description of the podcast.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4504s)

Yeah, okay. Anyway, there's, there's a tape in there, um, of Neil just being super rude and nasty. But he and I are like... he, he's had a rough, rough life, but he's, he's, he's, I'm so proud of him. He's, he's a great guy now. He came...

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4525s)

He came back to you in the end.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4526s)

Oh, he ran away from the group. And, um, he's, anyway, I'm very proud of my boy. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, so anyway, um, that's where I, I got paper and I'm sorry, that's what, that's what we do here. Okay. I ran along, but those are, those are things that I've witnessed in my life. These guys are not great men. They're just men. They're flawed the same as every [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4557s) person is. And uh, unfortunately they've misled many, many people and it's not the gospel that they're preaching. And the longer it goes on, I think the more evil I'm hearing about. Yeah. If I need to say something too, if I'm not going on too long.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4578s)

No, no, no.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4580s)

Not at all. I hear Bruce is trying to skim a whole lot of money out of people and uh, put it into some deal where they're going to make 20% per annum in, in uh, forever. Yep. And if anybody, anybody here is tempted, and I mean the wider audience is tempted to give money, based on what I've heard [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4610s) it, it is total bullshit, pardon me. It is. I have been lending money for decades, so I'm familiar with, you know, that side of things. And to promise people that you're going to get a 20% return forever is absolutely, you know the word, all right? I've been in the business probably for 30 years. I dabbled in it and then I got serious in it about 10 years ago. But I have sometimes, by making terribly risky loans, I have made 20%. But to think that you're going to be able to put out half a billion dollars at 20% is absolutely [ridiculous.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4676s) There's no such thing in this big wide world. And I just know that because I put in a piddly little amount and it's a full-time job putting out a piddly little amount. To keep track of putting out 500 million is would be horrendous. You need an army of staff to run it. And then to net out that 20% is impossible.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4703s)

Yeah, it just shows how delusional they get, right? Like they, their ideas become just more delusional, more delusional to the point where it's just, they're not even thinking straight.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4714s)

And to, for a company to pay 20%, that company is in very, very risky, shaky ground. So, um, you're going to lose big time if you loan your money to shaky businesses. So I thought about it a bit. The only way you're going to do it is maybe you're going to loan out, it's a non-arm's length transaction. You're going to lend it out to a company that is profitable and can afford to pay the 20%. And it's a way of getting around paying taxes. And it's a totally crooked, illegal scam. Um, wow. In other words, uh, Richard, I'll loan you a million dollars. Thank you. Yeah. You pay me back a hundred thousand, but you deduct that because it's a charity, right? And then we, we're avoiding taxes and you get the write-off because you are now, uh, it's a legitimate business expense that you're paying the money. And it is a total scam.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4791s)

It's very interesting because they specifically said, firstly, they actually got Bruce Hales in person. They played a whole long recording of him saying how wonderful this scheme was. I mean, that's pretty heavy stuff to get Bruce Hales personally to promote this thing. And then they specifically said they're going to be investing it in the kind of very best brethren businesses. So it's automatically not at arm's length because all the [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4821s) businesses are controlled by the UBT, which is controlled by Bruce Hales. So it's very incestuous. It can't possibly be at arm's length.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4830s)

No, he'll, he'll get, he'll get the money. And uh, you little Canadian schmuck that you are, you're going to be left holding the bag because CRA won't allow it. You'll be left paying the taxes that you evaded in the way of back taxes. That's what I wondered. You'll be left holding the bag. His money, he's already got the money offshore. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4858s)

Yeah. I mean, people, they're offering tax receipts, charitable tax receipts. But my feeling is that when it comes unraveled, then CRA is going to be coming after all the donors to pay the taxes because they shouldn't have, they can't issue a receipt for sending money overseas to that type of investment as far as I can make out.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4880s)

No, you know, no. It's a total scam and anybody gets involved in it is an absolute fool. And that's all I can say from a businessman's standpoint, you're a fool. Thank you. Thank you. And you don't have some... money, money and a fool are soon parted. Yep. This is our new...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4900s)

Charity expert.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4901s)

Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, it's, it's a scam. It is a total scam. And and I think anybody...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4910s)

That outside of it can see it. I mean, I know there's insiders that I talk to that have challenged other people about it, right? Yeah. Um, and yeah, people are still gobbling it up inside there.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4927s)

Yeah. Well, it's, it's anyway, that, that's, that's like, I don't know. I've only heard just from what you guys have told me about what the whole deal is, but it's, it's crazy.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4941s)

It stinks, doesn't it?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4942s)

Oh, it's, it's, and the poor sucker that's left holding the bag...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4948s)

Yeah. It's got the same disease that Mr. Symington's hogs had.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4955s)

Needs to be flushed and burnt. What was that, Carmen? What's the name of it again?

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4961s)

Called rhinitis.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4966s)

It's, it's anyway, it's nasty. Yeah. So anyway...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4971s)

Well, thank you very much, Dennis. We appreciate you coming on and you know, it was...

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4976s)

Well, it's uh, it's kind of fun.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=4981s)

It's nice to get a lot of people's, it's, you know, you're the older generation that have had these one-on-one interactions with these so-called, quote-unquote, great men. And it's good. It's good to be able to give the other half of the story for the insiders that had to watch and sit through the Sydney seminar that can now get the other part of the story. And then they can kind of come to a conclusion on their own after seeing both sides of the story.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5010s)

Exactly. And I would love so many peeps to see this. I would just like to say I have a wonderful life. I went through hell. I didn't go into much of the breakup of our family. It was hell. It was an absolute hell. But Richard has met Marion and he better say she's a nice lady.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5039s)

She's wonderful. She's a great cook as well.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5043s)

She's everything. She's ever done. And uh, you know, life, life is good. Uh, yeah, I, uh, you know, I, they wanted, I think they wanted all of us to end up in the gutter. Well, no. And well, Bruce Hales...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5059s)

Is, he's, he's actually preaching right now. He did this just recently. I mean, I know this podcast is going to come out in a couple of weeks. It's not, it's not going to air right away, but he has recently preached about how fast you deteriorate after you leave and those that have left, how we're deteriorating. And I, I just want to reiterate to Bruce that we are nowhere near deteriorating. I do not need no heart surgery. I'm like, to me, I like, by hearing what you're going through, sounds like you are [deteriorating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5089s) in the hell that you've got going on inside there. We're all doing quite fine and we're loving our life. We're just doing this to be accountable.

Well, you know, I, I just moved and I came across a whole lot of stuff. Do you want to see a picture of Marion? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really beautiful. You better believe it. Yeah. Yeah, she is. Here's, here's a car that I used to have when I was uh... oh, I love it. Oh, very, very fun.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5132s)

Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5134s)

The best of British thought.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5136s)

So what would you, we always, we ask this question when we can. What would you say to your, because you still have children left in there and you've probably got grandchildren, what would you say to them if, if they were to watch this? What would you want to say to them?

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5148s)

Oh, my goodness. Well, you know, I really, I, I like, I love them and all that. But I would love to just be able to speak with them and let them have half an hour of looking at my life and how I think God has blessed us. Not just materially, but we go, we're very, very involved in a a large church. It's our life. We have super [wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5182s) friends. Um, we go on holiday with them. We, we just have an abundant life. And that's what God wants us. That was an abundant life, not just materially, but spiritually. Yeah. I, I don't know. You put me on the spot, Cheryl.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5202s)

That's a beautiful, you know what, that was a beautiful answer. I think that's perfect.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5206s)

Well, okay. And I imagine all three of us could say the same bit.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5211s)

Absolutely. Yeah.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5213s)

Yeah. It's so full. It's so full.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5217s)

You do know we have a peace that we can't describe.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5220s)

Yeah. Like you don't deteriorate after you leave. I want to let everybody know inside there that is the farthest thing from the truth. Truth. Like if anything else, you gain your life back. You've come to life.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5233s)

Yeah, absolutely. And it took me probably nine, ten years. Well, I it's an, I won't go into my life story because it takes too long. But you know, the, I went for years and years, I, I was afraid to go into a church. I literally thought the chandelier would fall on my head. That was a kind of Christianity I had. And uh, you relate to that.

### [**Carmen Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5260s)

I can relate. I thought there would be thunder and lightning for sure. Thunder and lightning.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5265s)

Yeah, okay, all right. Yeah, that's exactly it. You, I'm just afraid the chandelier hit me in the head. And uh, so far it's, it's always missed. I love it. Yeah. Anyway, any chandelier that's dropped, it's not good. He's missed my head anyway. Yeah. And we have a wonderful, we really have a very full life. And we're off to Arizona next week. That's good.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5296s)

And you know, we're not saying that we don't go through heartache. The heartache comes from the separation, right? That's where the heartache lays. The grief lays in the rules that are still being held into play within the PBCC. But our lives are very fruitful. We are blessed beyond blessed. There is, I can't complain. I have a very simple life. And I love it. You know, it's just the grief and the [heartache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5327s) comes from the separation that we have to keep.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5329s)

Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And, and, you know, that's a pain that is always there. Yeah. You referred to a lot about your, your parents. Yeah. What can you say? It's a God given thing that we have family connections.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5346s)

Okay. Well, we should probably wrap this up. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much, Dennis. You're welcome on anytime. You know that you have a seat at our table whenever you want.

### [**Richard Marsh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5356s)

Thank you, Dennis.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5357s)

This, we know you have loads of stories in that.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5361s)

Oh, yeah. And unfortunately, I'm, that's what old boys do, you know, they just yap around about the past. But anyway...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5369s)

...though, because that's what you're passing down to our generation right now. I miss elders. I miss grandparents. I miss people telling stories. I love that part. I really, really enjoyed that part.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5378s)

I mean, someday we'll meet. You ever come east?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5382s)

Sure. You can sit and talk me, you're…

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5386s)

Would you ever come this way?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5388s)

I haven't, no, but Niagara Falls is on my bucket list.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5392s)

Yeah. Oh, that's just around the corner.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5394s)

Exactly.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5395s)

No, for any, but well, Richard knows, he knows the way. But uh, yep. You know, anyway, any of you guys, we'd love to see you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5403s)

Thank you so much. Okay.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5405s)

Take care.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5406s)

Okay. Until next time, everyone, take care. Much love to everybody.

### [**Dennis Wragge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6la61PHVjes&t=5412s)

That's great. Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
