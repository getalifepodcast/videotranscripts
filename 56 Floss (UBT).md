## Summary

Trigger warning- Discussions on suicide
A drastic look from an outsiders perspective while working at UBT, Floss learned very fast where she was on the PBCC hierachial system. In her year working there, she could not understand how awful this "Christian" group was to humans. She met with Bruce Hales a few times and he referred to her as a whore to her face. Forced to wear long skirts and stockings, Floss describes the UBT workplace as a culture dominated by bullies that have little or no respect for women. Listen in as she details the alcohol abuse, homophobia, misogyny, hypocrisy and bullying she endured that took 2 months to even stand back up from. This podcast is absolutely full of shocking information-shared from an outsider, who was kind enough to share her experience in the hopes of educating others to avoid being exposed to this workplace environment.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=0s)

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=21s)

Hi everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. I know it's been kind of a slow month for podcasts, that's because over on our side of the world we have summer and it's like plus 30 here. Where I live it's nine months of winter, eight months of winter, so we're soaking that up. So bear with us as we enjoy our summer on this side of the world.

Today we are joined with Carman and guests Ben [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=52s) Floss. So Floss is from Australia and she is going to tell us about her experience working for UBT, and I think it is absolutely phenomenal that someone came forward like this to really relay their experiences that a lot of people who are not a part of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have.

I think it's important. I think it's really important. So thank you so much Floss for joining us. Maybe do you want to start off by letting the viewers and listeners know where you were working and who your bosses [were?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=94s)

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=94s)

Yeah, sure. Well, firstly, thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to be sharing my story and my experience with working for the Brethren. So I was hired by UBT about six or seven years ago and I worked there for about a year and a half.

And so for those of you that don't know, UBT is basically like the head office. And so there's different parts of the business. They look after OneSchool Global, so the brethren schooling, and they also look after changing all of the phones, the laptops and the cars to be brethren appropriate. So you know, making sure that the internet is the way that it should be and you can't search anything that is not appropriate.

They also looked after all of the finances, they kind of did just about everything and we also organised all of the large events that the brethren had, including I believe one each year that had all the members from around the world, so that UBT was in charge of organising that as well. And my boss's boss was Bruce Hales, so I did have some contact with him a couple of times. 

[Wow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=189s) What was he like?

I personally wasn't a big fan. He was very clearly well respected. And when we knew that Bruce was going to be in the office, it was a really big deal. So of course, everyone that was part of the community was making sure they were perfectly dressed, the haircuts done, and the women had their hair done [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=223s) their bows, their headbands on at the time, making sure that everything was perfect.

For me and other people who were not part of the Brethren community, we would typically kind of stay in the background a little bit. We were not really anyone who he was interested in seeing. But I did have some contact [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=253s) him at one of the events, which was a business event. It was really teaching brethren business owners how to make more money and how to capitalise on the worldly people and their bank accounts.

I was standing with him and my boss [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=283s) day during this event and some of the women were starting to arrive. They were having a conversation between each other about the Brethren women being, you know, so beautiful and so pure, and I asked the question, "What do you mean pure? Like what does that mean?"

They very kindly told me that all brethren women are pure [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=314s) beautiful because they follow in the words so eloquently and so beautifully, unlike worldly women who are whores. So like myself, I was a whore because I didn't believe it and I was found to be unattractive and whorish in their eyes and in God's eyes. I literally just stood there and was like, [oh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=345s)

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=345s)

Can I just ask, what's wrong with that? Like is there a problem with being a whore? I mean no.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=353s)

But don't speak to me as an insult. What a word to use though. Like where I come from over here, if someone had said that, that would have been, we would take great offense to that. Right. Yeah. Like I can't believe someone. So did Bruce Hales himself say this?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=373s)

Yes. So both him and my boss. I was called a whore multiple times at work. That was the one real experience that I had with Bruce, and I was just like, okay, and kind of just walked away. I was so shocked because one, I'm not easily offended, you can say pretty much anything to me and I'm not going to care. But in this particular setting and especially based on the [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=403s) as a whole that I had at UBT and with the brethren community, it was just like another thing that made me feel not human.

I was so small, and I was already small because I was a woman, I was not part of the community, and they also made mention of the fact a couple of times that I was living with my partner out of [wedlock,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=434s) he had two children from a previous relationship out of wedlock, and I'm covered in tattoos. So I was just the bottom of the barrel.

And so I knew that when they were saying things like, you're a whore because you don't do this and you don't follow this, that it was really just like the biggest insult that they could give me. And so I took offense to it because one, we're in a workplace and you probably shouldn't [speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=464s) like that in a workplace, absolutely not.

And two, you're also making it known that I'm well below you and that you see me as absolutely nothing on this earth. And that's what I found was hurtful about it, because we're all human, we're all having a human experience. And what you're doing and the way that you see things and believe things is that you sit on a pedestal [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=495s) the rest of us are down in the swamps and are nothing and will then don't matter.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=503s)

The complete opposite of what you would think a Christian, mainstream Christian group would be, right? Like it's just the opposite.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=512s)

Yeah, that is so bizarre and it's so, like I'm not shocked. I mean I am, but I'm not. Like I thought you wouldn't be that stupid to do it to somebody outside. I mean, I've heard of him losing it with people inside, but it just shows how comfortable he is with his own behavior, which is really, really, really sad actually.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=535s)

Yeah, well the thing is that what he's then teaching the rest of the community is it's not only okay to think like that, but it's okay to speak that way and to treat people that way because what Bruce says goes. And if it's okay for him, it's okay, you know, from a brethren point of view, if it's okay for him, it's okay for me.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=566s) on the same token, I find it really hard to get angry and upset with people sitting within the brethren community because they don't know any different. What they're looking at and what they're basing their life and their life model on is a certain family and a certain belief that they don't know any different from. That's what they know.

It's not as if I was to say, "Oh, well I'm actually really interested in joining this community and I know a whole different life," and then I go in there and then I change my behavior to become like that, because then I would know better. But they simply don't. And I find that really sad because the world is a great place, people are beautiful [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=627s) kind and loving and helpful and supportive, but they don't see the world that way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=634s)

And that's why we do these podcasts, is for education, right? It's educating the public. It's also, there has to be, I think the time has come where accountability needs to be taken. And that's why we're educating the way we're educating, is because there should be no way that a leader of what they call themselves as a mainstream Christian church should be speaking that way. Or his 55,000 plus members that he has, [letting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=664s) them know that it is okay to be that way. Right? No matter what their life is inside, that is not okay to treat another human being like that. And that's where the accountability has to happen.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=676s)

Yeah, and it kind of gives validation to all of our stories because you have moments of being like, "Is it just us?" It really gives validation to our stories, saying, "Okay, so we're right in saying that this culture is bad." Yes, we've said over and over, it's not the individual people. Like my mom, I think is innocent and there are other innocent people in there. But unfortunately the majority are like this. And like it was your boss and your boss's boss. It's people like that that enjoy this system, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=707s) thrive in it. And their behavior is so omnipresent because it is a system where it caters for it and the leader is the main influence, and so is his family. So everybody sort of follows suit and that behavior is like normal.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=722s)

I think that's the most shocking part of it. Like we all knew this was a problem inside, but I don't ever remember hearing a report coming back that one of the leaders, I don't remember hearing this about John Hales. I know I never saw my grandfather act this way towards people that were not members of our community. So I just find it so shocking he would be so out there and actually treat people [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=752s) are not part of the community in this manner. You know, it's one thing for him to do it inside where he's trying to bring about that brainwashing, but to go outside of the community and do that is just, it's really shocking to me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=769s)

It's very sad. Yeah, it shows how comfortable he is with his behavior, like it's normal. And it makes me think sometimes maybe he does believe his own lies.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=779s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=780s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=781s)

Like I remember watching my grandpa, you know, with home care nurses or just people in the community, and he never, I don't ever remember him acting his meeting behavior out on people from the outside community.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=800s)

And we should just let our viewers and listeners know that the grandfather that Carman's talking about is Mr. Symonton, who was also the man of God at one point. So when she refers to her grandfather, he was the “Bruce Hales” at one point in time.

So how long did you work for them for?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=821s)

It was just over a year and honestly it was pretty much a miracle that I lasted that long.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=831s)

I would say so, yeah.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=833s)

Yeah, so when I got the job I didn't know anything about the Brethren community. I was just told by a recruiter, "You've got really good experience for this role. Are you happy working for a company that are predominantly, how did she put it, like conservative Christian?" And I thought, "Yep, doesn't bother me, I'm just going to go and do my job."

And so I went to the interview with my future boss at that point. And I asked the question, "You know, I've been told by the recruiter that you're a conservative Christian group. Do I have to be Christian? Do I have to be part of the group?" And he said, "Oh no no no, it's just us." And he said, "I'm just letting you know we are not a cult." And I was like, "Okay." So in my head I'm like, "Okay so you're definitely a cult if you have to tell me that you're not one." [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=908s) right.

And so, that should have been the first red flag, but I just thought, okay, cool. And so I was offered the job and then I was given the instructions on how I was to dress and how I was to behave. My understanding was if I'm not part of your religious group, you dress how you want to dress and I'll dress how I want to dress. It was quite formal so I certainly wasn't going to show up at work in short shorts and a boob tube.

But I was told, you know, have to wear long skirts, have to wear stockings, and because I had tattoos, long sleeve at all times, minimal makeup, and kind of dull colors. At the time I had a lot of bright clothing and I loved wearing, I wore quite heavy makeup and was like a red lipstick or like almost like a black lipstick every day. I was big on the lipstick at the time and I thought, okay, I can change that for work, that's fine.

And then on my first day I was pulled aside and told that my shirt, so I was wearing a long sleeve orange t-shirt, it was too loud. It was bringing too [much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=997s) attention to me and I was just like, "Oh, uh, okay." I was like, "I will not wear this again." And I never did. I never put it back on. So it was very muted. And I was also told I couldn't say "hi" or "hey," I had to say "hello."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1017s)

Oh my god, I forgot about this. I remember that. I used to work for the leader's son-in-law, so for another brethren business that had influence, and I remember being pulled up all the time for saying "hi" or "hey" or "hey are you going to say it" in my emails as well. And they're like, "You have to say hello."

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1038s)

Yes, we had to say hello also, otherwise you definitely get pulled up with, "You shouldn't have said that in your email." And I'm looking at the email thinking, "What do you mean? It just says 'hi, please find attached'." Like, "No, you can't say hi." I'm like, "Okay, all right, I won't say that again."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1060s)

I wish we had pictures of the photo books right now, how loud the clothing is that they wear, right? I might add it in here if you see something. I'll find some pictures and I'll give some examples of how loud the clothing is that people wear.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1076s)

And so they made you wear stockings too? Yeah, so we had to wear stockings. And I tell you what, on my last day I got in my car and I physically ripped them off my legs. I was like, "No, I'm not doing this again." And when I got home, I walked in the door and of course there's little bits of stocking still hanging off my legs. My husband just looked at me and he's like, "Are you okay?" And I'm like, "It's done. It's over. I'm out." And he was just like, "Okay, cool."

Did [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1125s) give you a biblical reason they were asking for this? Like what is their belief that requires stockings? All I was told was the reason is that you just have to be covered up. And I thought, "Okay, well I can be covered up, but I mean my ankles aren't really that sexy, but I can cover them with stockings if you want." But I didn't understand, [nor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1155s) was it really properly explained to me. It was just, "You need to be covered up."

So everything was high neck, long sleeve. And I remember they were so strict on that that before we moved into the new office, it was a 40 degree day and the air conditioning had died. So it was incredibly hot in the office and of course because I have tattoos down both my arms, I was in long sleeves and I was absolutely sweating. All I wanted to do was just roll my sleeves up.

I [went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1185s) to, and they were like, "No." And so down it went. So I was walking back and forth to the bathroom and literally just splashing water underneath my top to cool down. And then I would go back out and then at one point I almost fainted and I just said, "I'm really sorry, I have to go. I can't stay here for the day." And they're like, "Yep, okay, no worries." So I just walked out and got in the car and was just ripping clothes off. I was like, "How can you not even let me roll my sleeves up? [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1215s) my tattoos aren't going to jump off my skin and onto yours. It's fine. I'm just really hot right now."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1226s)

Maybe they thought they were contagious.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1226s)

Yeah, I mean, maybe. I mean the worst mentality.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1236s)

Oh my, I'm just, yeah, for the first time I'm speechless. I don't even know what to ask you next.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1245s)

Just keep going Floss, this is so interesting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1250s)

I want to cry for you. At the same time I'm needing to pick my mouth up off the ground.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1257s)

Yeah, I mean I was pretty much like that every day. I think the more that I learned, at first I was finding it quite funny because I was like, "Oh, this is so weird, like this is such a weird way of living." But people kind of seem nice enough. Everything was sunshine and rainbows when I first started. It was a bit strange, but everyone was really lovely.

But the longer that I was there [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1288s) the more that I was actually paying attention to what was going on around me, the more that I was like, "Oh, this is really not normal." It's a really strange way to live. And then I started to see nasty behavior, not only towards me and other people that were outside of the community, but inside as well. They were quite nasty to each other.

But it was all like muttered comments. It was all under your breath. It was never really a direct thing. So if anyone had an issue with another person, instead of just saying, "Hey, I've got an issue, can we talk it out?" it was just nasty whispers that would kind of go around. And we would all know about it. We would all know what was happening.

It was like this bullying behavior that I really didn't like and I didn't agree with because it was worse than high school. Because at high school you're dealing with 12 year olds, not grown men and women [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1371s) a business setting who all spend every day at work together and then every day at church together. So I can only imagine how much more was being said in the wider community based on what I was just seeing within the office space.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1391s)

So my heart is with you on having to wear those stockings because they were the bane of most women's existence. And you know, they were just awful to wear. Besides the stockings, what other crazy rules did they have in there regarding your attire?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1408s)

So brethren women have to wear a covering on their head, so they usually had bows or headbands. We were not allowed to, being outside of the community, we were not allowed to wear anything on our head. So we could have a hair tie, but no ribbons, no bows, no headbands. Nothing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1434s)

That's ridiculous. Floss, did you understand that the women wear it so they get extra protection from angels?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1440s)

No, I was not given a reason as to why they had head coverings. I kind of put an assumption myself that, you know, in biblical times, women would wear headscarves and I just assumed it was the same kind of principle, but more modern. Because we can't be wearing a headscarf. Well, I can't, but they couldn't be wearing headscarves. So they would go, you know, it's a bit more fashionable if you're wearing a headband or a bow. But I couldn't wear [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1481s) now anyway. I would feel a little bit too brethren-like if I was to put a headband or a big bow in my hair.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1489s)

The whole hypocrisy on that is their understanding and why their women wear them. And then to deny another woman that right. Maybe you wanted to be like, "Hey, I want that kind of protection," if you had known what it was for. The hypocrisy, that's what I was getting at, right? To deny another woman that right, it blows my mind.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1512s)

But it also ties back to what you're saying the leader was saying in the beginning of this, was that when the brethren women are so pure, the outsiders are just whores.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1524s)

Yeah, and you know what, it's just sad. It's sad because how many women are in there that have been sexually abused and yet it's covered up. They're made to either marry that person that abused them, or in that kind of a situation for the same age. There's just so many layers to how they mistreat women when it comes to their purity.

I think it's sad that they don't look at pedophilia in there. If they were so concerned about a woman's purity, I'm taking myself for example, right? Like how young it was that person took that from me and I never had a say in that, but yet he's still in there and I'm out. It just doesn't make sense.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1571s)

And then I started to get really, I found it quite upsetting to see that women in the Brethren community were basically nothing. They were there to work until they were married. They would leave on a random Tuesday at two o'clock to go to a wedding and then come back [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1602s) few hours later, which I thought was wild because it's your wedding day. It should probably be more than a couple of hours in the middle of a work day, but you do you.

But once they were married, that was it. We wouldn't see them again. They were gone to have babies and clean the house and keep the households clean and tidy and food on the table. It was just really strange to kind of see that. And I could see the pressure on some of the younger girls.

Even though they weren't allowed to be friends with me, I was actually friends with a couple of them. We only ever spoke at work because of course they had no social media. I remember talking to them and they were upset because they were kind of aware or had been made aware that they probably weren't pretty enough to be with someone and that they were probably not going to get married.

And if they did, it probably wouldn't be for a very long time. I remember having this conversation with them where they were getting, like, "Oh no, we're just going to be single forever." At first I kind of made a joke like, "Oh but you kind of all get married off, that seems to be the thing that happens here." And they were just like, "No, some of us just don't because we're not good looking enough and there are prettier girls."

And I was like, "Well that's really stupid." And so I made a joke to come to the dark side. I said, "Oh if you come over to the dark side, I mean I know a single guy so I can introduce you." And I remember the look on their faces where they're like, "Oh, okay." And I was just like, "Oh no no, I won't do that. I'll get in so much trouble and you'll get in so much trouble."

But as we were talking, as soon as I said [that,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1730s) our relationship changed in that they felt they could talk to me a bit more and I was understanding. They would quite often, if I was going into a meeting, take my phone and scroll through my Instagram and my Facebook and go on Google and all the things that they absolutely weren't allowed to do. You could see them light up and just see that there was something else outside of the confines of the beliefs that they have grown up with and the views on the outside world, on the dark side, which is not so dark.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1775s)

I would say it's much darker in there than out here.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1778s)

Absolutely. Funny, the irony of all that is they tell you all your life, you know, those that have left, how great the darkness is, they've lost all the light. I'm like, "No, it's actually the complete opposite. I've never been more illuminated with my life than ever."

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1790s)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1796s)

Did you notice about the computers and the phones? Like you talked about preparing them so that certain things couldn't be searched. Is it like set programs?

### [**Floss**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6TAMQtQdT7w%26t%3D1808s)

Yeah, so the computers that we were issued as well were completely blocked to everything. So quite often what would happen is if we were looking up a business, literally even trying to look up like a [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1826s) business, sometimes there would be either a certain keyword or phrase that would be picked up in that search and you basically were blocked off. It would come up with the sign to say that you can't go in because it's not appropriate and that was it.

So then you kind of have to get around it. A lot of the time I was actually using my phone just to be able to look up a phone number of a business. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1857s) yeah, so it was kind of shut off. I couldn't look at the news, any website that had a video, which is most websites, you couldn't see. You couldn't look up, of course, there was no social media. There was absolutely nothing. It was really, really limited in what you could see.

I remember having a conversation with my boss at one point and I said, "I'm really struggling to do my [job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1887s) because I can't look up anything." I said, "Is this the same on all the laptops?" And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah." And so he was kind of explaining, "We can't really see anything that is not approved and we don't want to see anything bad." And I just said, "Okay, fair enough." Like if you don't want to see anything bad, but if you want to see something bad you really have to purposely look for it. It's not [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1917s) going to pop up on your screen.

I was asking about, "Is it the same on your phones?" And he said, "Yes, so it's blocked off, like we can't download particular apps, it won't come up." And I was like, "Okay." And then he said the same thing about cars. He said, "You know, they removed the radio and so we can only kind of listen to particular music." Which I later learned was, because they had like a heap of TV [screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1947s) around the office and they had a, I can't remember the name of the band, but it was their band with I think there was like 15 kids on there that were dancing and singing and they all had their outfits and they were songs that I'd never seen or heard of before.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1966s)

It was not, it was northern something. There was something, okay. I think they have their own music app. It's called the Trove app or something. It's Trove.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1979s)

Yeah, this was seven years ago Carman, they wouldn't have had it then.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1985s)

Oh, okay, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=1986s)

Yeah, it would have been like the BA Choir because I left seven years ago so it would have been about that time when BA Choir or some other group did something and they listened to it. You wouldn't have heard the song because there were some hymns or from the dinosaur era.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2005s)

Yeah, I heard. So they were playing it, it was on a loop with the music videos, and we would always see it and hear it when we went upstairs. Yeah, so they had a dining hall and like a chef. So, of course, we didn't sit with each other. Everyone was quite segregated, as were the rules. But yeah, that's all the music that you could hear playing on a loop.

And then you would walk past [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2035s) they had little music clips to go with it. And everyone was in matching, colourful outfits. And I was like, "Oh this is pumping, like great music. Do you listen to anything else?" And they're like, "Oh no, we don't listen to any outside music." And I was like, "Okay." And I was like, "Do you watch movies or TV shows?" And they're like, "No, no we don't. We typically don't have TVs in our houses."

And when I was talking to my boss about that, I was like, "So no TVs, no screens, nothing?" And he said, "No." And I stupidly just said, "Oh well what's all your furniture pointed at? Because my furniture's pointed at my TV so I can watch it. So what do you do with your furniture?" And he [said,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2086s) "We've just got a lot of chairs and they're all, there's a lot of chairs. We can have a lot of guests." And I was just like...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2093s)

They literally are. It reminds me of a nursing home. All the chairs and lounges are around in a circle to fit like max 30 people.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2103s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2104s)

None of that lounging in front of the TV.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2107s)

So just lounge in front of other people.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2108s)

Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2109s)

Do you know that on their phones or laptops, if you were to search up like say a suicide hotline or a mental health hotline, would that be available?

### [**Floss**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6TAMQtQdT7w%26t%3D2119s)

No. There is nothing to do with anything mental health, which I think is really dangerous, not just for that community, but for anyone on this planet that you should have access to mental health services. But no, you couldn't. If you typed in "suicide hotline," "suicide" would flag. And so it would cut you off. So I imagine that it would be quite difficult to get access to those services. And probably the only way that you would is if you were to be sneaky and go into a doctor's office and ask for either the physical phone number or get them to call on your behalf.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2168s)

This is the part that I think is illegal and that they need to be called out on. Because I think of, say myself being 16, right, and in the boat that I was in in there. And you initially want to reach out for help. So you think of a 16 year old, 15 year old, 14 year old, 12 year old that all of a sudden is so bottomed out and is like, "Okay, I need to go for help," right?

And they pick up their phone in that moment to get the help they need. And it is not available. And then the next moment they take their life because that's how it happens. It happens in a split second. You don't think about, "I need to go talk to my parents." You [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2211s) think, "I need to go talk to my siblings or to a priest." That's not what you're thinking.

Your mind goes to literally, "Who can I get outside of this that can help me?" And this is the part that we need to stress over and over and over that this has to be some way made illegal. They should not be able to have a charity status when people inside there cannot have access to mental health help, because these are people's lives.

And as prominent as mental health awareness is nowadays, they are [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2247s) in the dinosaur age. And it should be brought to the authorities. It should be brought to the charity commissions. It should be brought to those people that have a say in this and they should have, every person in there should have access to everybody else's access to mental health help and the suicide hotlines.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2264s)

Definitely. And in particular, so much for my community, the gay community within there. Because I remember when I tried to commit suicide, there was no help. The only help I got was when the ambulance and the police turned up and then ensured that I got to a mental health hospital. And I spoke with somebody outside of the community, that I realised that, okay, there is help on the outside.

But prior to that, I had no one to call. There was no access to anything because of how frozen their phones and [computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2294s) are, how communist-like their internet is. I think it's a really important thing because people do commit suicide in there. And I know they don't believe in suicide. We were told over and over, "It's, the Lord got to him before the devil did." But that's not the reality. That doesn't change the fact that somebody did commit suicide and end their life, essentially.

So it's really, I think it's a really important point you've raised. Do you know if there's like any, Floss, any sort of, like, did you ever hear, say I [Googled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2325s) LGBTQI+ help on my phone? Obviously, it's going to come up blocked. But was there anything you've ever heard of my phone then being flagged and notified with head office like UBT that, "Hey, Ben's tried to access this"? Because there's some stories going that people have shared where they're like, "I don't know how they found out this," you know, they haven't told anyone, but they're wondering if the computers or the phones are linked to some sort of software that flagged certain [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2355s) you're looking up?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2357s)

Yeah. So I think that, my assumption would be that it would be the same as it was within UBT. So anything that we tried to search up would, of course, be flagged and they would know about it, which is in some respects similar to when you're working in a normal office. There are some companies that track everything that you do and you can be completely unaware of it.

There's nothing that comes up on your phones, on your emails, on your laptop. It's just that it's being watched and what happens in those scenarios is that the keyword will come up and then of course you can go back and see who's looked at it. So I know that it was like that within UBT, so I would assume that it would be, considering that it was a company that was programming all of the phones and the laptops, that everyone would be under the same [rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2418s) and that Big Brother is watching.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2422s)

Yeah, I was going to say that. I hope that answers a lot of questions for people listening that you might be researching or googling for help, but also know you're also alerting UBT or your family or whoever it is that powers that be. So if you can, try and do that on the outside on a non-brethren technological device.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2443s)

And I think what this really shows is how far they take religious freedom. And that's where I think our laws and governing bodies need to come in and tighten things down. Because there is such a thing as everybody having their own freedom to their religious beliefs. That is true. But then there is the extent of what we have within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church that we know full well [could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2474s) end up in another Jonestown massacre.

We know that that could go that way. And so there's this fine line in between the two where I believe our government in every country that the PBCC are need to really tighten down those laws and not allowing something that happened in our history to repeat itself. And this Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has every sign that points to that same [direction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2504s)

It's sad. It's just sad. I mean we all have family in there. It's the one thing that all of us have in the back of our mind that we want to try and prevent. Yet it has got to be the government and the authorities that can make these changes happen.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2526s)

I think they've done a good job worldwide of recognizing coercive control in a domestic setting. But coercive control, the definition needs to be broadened and they need to recognize that religions can coercively control, cults coercively control. And they need to recognize it's just as dangerous for a religion to exhibit coercive control as it is for in a domestic [relationship.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2556s)

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2558s)

It just makes me sad to know that some young teen in there, going through their hormonal changes, questioning so many different things in their life, does not have access to help outside their community in a situation where they are thinking of taking their life. Like that is the biggest number one thing that needs to be taken care of in there.

Did you witness a lot of the bullying through hierarchy, knowing that somebody's got more money, so to speak, or is higher up in the church than somebody else? Did you ever witness any of that?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2601s)

Yeah. So what I find really interesting is, when I started at UBT, there was only a small group of us who were not part of the community. I remember having a conversation with a couple of people and I was saying, "Oh, this company pays quite well. Like, it's quite good." And they laughed and they said, "Oh, we're only getting half of what the brethren are."

So I had 10 years experience behind me and then a girl who had just come out of school from the brethren was being paid double what I was. And I was just like, "Okay, this explains why they have so much money." But you could then see that of course the women were being paid far less than what the men were. And so you could see this kind of hierarchy.

The higher your position, of course you were getting paid more, but it was a significant amount more. And so you weren't just talking, you know, I can speak to the director of my company [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2688s) I work for now, I mean she owns it, and I could talk to her as if she is my equal. But you wouldn't have that at UBT unless you were good friends outside of work.

So you could see people talking down to each other. And it was so slight. That was the thing. It wasn't like a big obvious thing where you would say something [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2719s) directly and so loud that everyone would hear it and kind of turn around. It would just kind of be like a little laugh here and there or just like really high school kind of bullying. But not being part of the community, we faced it a lot.

It was always kind of made pretty clear where we stood with them. So as I [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2749s) before, I'm a woman covered in tattoos, living with a partner out of wedlock. And so they used to kind of look at me, I could see the way that they were looking at me and some of the things that they would say to me that would make me feel really small.

And then there was a guy who came to work who was not part of the community who was very clearly and obviously gay. And I remember him walking in and just thinking, "Oh, my God, walk back out. Like, these people are going to eat you alive. [Like,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2789s) you just go." And just seeing him kind of dull himself so as to not offend anyone by just being himself.

And, of course, like people outside of the community, we didn't care. Be gay, straight, bi, non-binary. Be a chicken if you want to be. It doesn't matter. But watching other people make themselves small and [unseen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2820s) so as to not offend a group of people. And I spent the year that I was working there, this is exactly what I did. I made myself small, I made myself quiet, I was not myself at all.

Nobody saw my personality, nobody heard my voice. I just did my job and I was quiet about it. And if things came up, if there was ever any issues, I would [word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2850s) it and make sure that it was an issue that if I could fix it, it would help them and help the business. The one time that I did speak up, it just went downhill so quickly.

So I spoke up because one of the brethren women that I was working with was quite nasty, came to me and she called me, she said I was a "stupid little [monkey."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2880s) And I was just like, "Cool, that's really rude." And so I went to HR because she was constantly making little comments and I had just grown sick of it. And so I went to HR, and the HR department was run by people outside of the Brethren community. So I thought, "Great, I can come and tell you my problems."

And these are work issues, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2910s) has got nothing to do with religion. It's got to do with being in a workplace and feeling safe. And I remember saying to him in HR, "I'm being spoken to like this and frankly I've had enough. And there's only so small and so quiet I can make myself before I burst." And basically the response I got back was, "Well unfortunately it's just their beliefs and you just have to deal with [it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2940s) And I was like, "Well no, it doesn't have anything to do with religion. It doesn't matter. We're in a workplace."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2948s)

Human decency and how you should be treated.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2952s)

Yeah, so it was completely, everything including the HR department in a workplace was controlled by these rules and this belief system. And I remember when I left, I ended up leaving because I was so anxious all the time. Like I was getting panic attacks. So I was driving to work, I [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=2982s) sit in the car park and hyperventilate and be crying and think, "Okay, I've got to pull myself together, I've got to work."

And so, the she was like my best friend when I was working there and she used to park next to me and she was the same. So we would both be in a panic.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3004s)

Was she an outsider as well?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3007s)

Yeah, so she was. And she, you know, she was 20 years older than me and she was having the same experience as me. And so we would both be freaking out in the car. And then we used to joke that we were walking down the green mile to go to our fate. And we'd walk to the office and you just get in there.

And I just remember being so anxious all the time and just [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3037s) having to switch to be this other person because that was expected of me. And I wasn't getting anything in return. I wasn't part of the community, I was just there to do a job, but I had to do my job being somebody else so as to not make other people feel uncomfortable.

And that whole belief system that you can make people feel [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3067s) this or believe that people are like that, that they have to be something so small and quiet and muted, and you just follow the rules or you're made to feel like that, is incredibly dangerous. Because if that's my experience sitting outside of that community, then the people that are sitting in there not only do they probably feel like that, but a lot of them wouldn't even know that that's how they [feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3097s) because that's their day-to-day life and they don't understand that they're probably a much happier and much bigger person, but they don't have the opportunity to be themselves.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3113s)

And that's why they run into the problems that they have now, which is the bullying, which is the alcoholism. You start replacing all these things because you feel so wrong and feel so unfulfilled, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3126s)

Yeah, and you want to feel. It's really sad and it's interesting to hear your perspective on it because it's like an outsider. And yes, it is that. You're so familiar with the anxieties inside that you think it's everyday norm. And there's comfort with familiarity, right? Like if that's all you've known, it's, "Well that's all I've known."

And there's some sort of safe harbor in that. And it's just so sad to think that, you know, I think about my mom all the time and I'm like, "You don't know [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3156s) different. You think this is normal and you're constantly ill and nobody can find out why." This is why. It's the culture, the group you're a part of, the environment. Did you ever experience any drinking culture at all? Had you heard of the drinking culture in the brethren?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3172s)

Yes. I was thinking the same thing. I learned pretty quickly that there is like a massive alcohol problem amongst the brethren men. It's not hard to pick up when somebody has a drinking problem, and I can pick up behaviors really quickly. My father used to drink quite a lot so I can, he was never abusive but of course you can pick up when somebody does drink.

And so lunch was provided to us every day at work and so we would all have a lunch break all roughly at around the same time, but of course we didn't sit together. So I couldn't sit on the same table. As you would know, you're not allowed. And so we would get our lunch and quite often the men were allowed to drink, the brethren men were allowed to drink.

So quite often they would have much longer lunch breaks because they were sitting down and having a drink. And I was sitting there thinking, "Well, if you can have something, why can't I? Like just one cheeky mug on my lunch break, why not?" But yeah, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3259s) was, so alcohol was actually right in the workplace.

Yes, so it was in the workplace. And even if there were, you know, there was a company that we were partnering with, so we would quite often go to their company for, you know, to learn better about finances and business models and all those kinds of things. And so we [would](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3289s) have lunch there.

And I remember walking past, and so I was always put in another room to eat, but they would always have bottles and bottles of beer in there. And not a great deal would be done in the afternoon because everyone's got a belly full of food and beer and that was just kind of the norm. [Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3335s) it just became normal to see people drinking at work on a daily basis.

And they never brought it down to their desks, but a one hour lunch break turned into a two hour, three hour lunch break and they're all upstairs having a really great time. And I could see this pattern of where it didn't even look like they would do it, like some of them were not doing it just [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3365s) enjoy a drink with their meal, it was almost like a habitual thing like, "I need this to be able to keep going."

And I just remember thinking, "God, it's really strange that it's completely okay and nobody bats an eyelid." It's just if they want another drink, just give them another drink. And I was thinking if they're able to drink in this way at 12 o'clock on [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3396s) Tuesday at work...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3399s)

You should see them at 12 o'clock on a Sunday.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3401s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3405s)

Yeah. Would there have been anyone there with an RSA, like a responsible service of alcohol, for legally to be our server?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3413s)

There was, they had a chef, but I don't know what his licensing was. I mean there was certainly nothing to say that we were like a licensed premises like you would see if you're going to a restaurant or something like that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3437s)

And wouldn't it have to be the chef would have to be the one handing it out? I mean that's how I know it to work. And was the chef handing out the alcohol?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3449s)

It wouldn't be a help-yourself thing. That's what I thought.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3453s)

It was just, there was just fridges that you could help yourself to if you're a brethren man. We've heard reports of this in Canada, where in Canada there's a very strict liquor board law, where it's not to be served without somebody that's licensed in bartending or whatever. So it's really interesting to hear you say it actually happened.

Yeah, it was a normal thing there. I enjoy a drink and sometimes I enjoy too many, but I know when it's appropriate to drink.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3508s)

Drinking every day at a workplace, that just shouldn't be. That's not a common practice in an everyday workplace.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3520s)

I don't think that's legal. Have you guys ever encountered another workplace that serves alcohol at the workplace?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3529s)

I haven't. I've never worked at a workplace.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3531s)

Am I the only one that has never seen this before?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3533s)

The pub down the road from 12 o'clock to late.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3541s)

Workplace, Ben.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3545s)

Carman. People do work there.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3548s)

Point taken.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3550s)

No, that's what I'm saying. I'm trying to draw the simile here between a pub and yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3555s)

Exactly. I want to go back to something that you talked about earlier and it's on pay. Would you say, so we understand every job has, the more you're qualified, the more money you make. Would you say that there's people that are more qualified in a position that get paid less because of their hierarchy inside the business [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3586s) within a family or leadership position?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3589s)

Probably. I mean I didn't see anybody's paychecks personally. What I understood was that the higher up you are, the more that you get paid. And they were ludicrous amounts. Like, I was being paid well, but I also had [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3624s) lot of experience behind me. And, without sounding disrespectful, I also had a proper education behind me.

And to know that there was people who were just coming out of high school that were being paid double, and understanding that they were just kind of starting out. I kind of knew some of the pay brackets that some of the managers were in and they were huge.

I think that you could really understand who sat higher up, not just in a job status but in a family [status,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3675s) when they walked into the room, when they walked into the building and the way that people looked at them and spoke to them. And so you could kind of see that there were families who were maybe better known or kind of more respected. And then you could see other people who maybe didn't have that same kind of status being spoken to differently. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3706s) I would assume probably being paid differently because they're basically throwing money at the popular kids.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3718s)

Yeah, it's really what it was. I'll attach on here two quotes from a business seminar that Bruce Hales talked about, the wage between a non-community member and a PBCC member. So I'll attach those on to this so people can get an inside look at how he views this.

### [**Floss**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6TAMQtQdT7w%26t%3D3739s)

I'd be interested to see that.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3747s)

Yeah, it's quite the, yeah, it shocked me when I saw it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3756s)

It really solidifies what you're saying. I think the general impression was that you look after the brethren better, which I understand you look after your own family better, but not to a point where it's brutally unfair or borderline illegal.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3776s)

And I mean this isn't even family, right? We're talking about just because they're a part of an actual religious group that they get paid more than somebody who is not. Like that is literally a violation of your human rights. That is completely religious discrimination.

And so those are the stories that we're collecting right now. So if you are someone who has worked for the PBCC and know of this, please email us at info.getalife@proton.me. We're collecting these stories right now.

And so did you find too, as a female, that you were very much more looked down on? Talk to us a little bit more about the difference between a female's role there versus a male's role.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3826s)

I was literally about to ask that. So I was going to say, talk to us about misogyny and homophobia. Was there any homophobia as well?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3835s)

Oh, yes, there was homophobia, and I do have a story on that. But it was, yeah, look, being a woman there, so all of our job titles, and this is Brethren women and worldly women, all of our roles were essentially, regardless of what we were actually doing, they were all low roles. And when I say low, I mean like very basic kind of admin roles.

And to be fair, the brethren women that were working there were doing really basic admin stuff. They weren't doing what me and some of the other women were doing. And really we were hired [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3894s) they didn't have the skill set and the experience within their own community, which is why they started to hire people from outside the community, because we all had a background and a knowledge that they simply could not attain within their community.

But it was also, I mean I could have gone in there and been the smartest scientist in the world, but I would have been given a role, even if I was doing all these science experiments, my role would be admin assistant.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3939s)

EAS is the sales executive assistant.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3942s)

Yeah. And so, and then you would see that, like I remember getting really pissed off one day because my boss was demoted because he had not been doing his job and I was given another manager who was 10 years my junior. And it was his first role ever and he was my manager and I was [teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=3978s) him what to do because he had no clue, he'd just finished school.

But he came in with quite a high position and I'm sure a fantastic pay. But I was teaching him what to do. I was telling him how to do his job and how to work certain systems because he had absolutely no clue. But you wouldn't see that with a woman. You wouldn't have a brethren woman come in and get a high position. It just wouldn't happen. There were no female [managers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4013s) from the Brethren community. We had one manager that was hired who was outside of the Brethren and she was a manager. She was basically the office manager. But yeah, they gave that position to a worldly woman, not to a Brethren woman.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6TAMQtQdT7w%26t%3D4031s)

That's too high for a brethren woman.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4040s)

Wow. I'm going to read this because I found the quote. So, "When non-community staff are hired at a lot lower rates of pay than community, how should this be handled to avoid discrimination?" This is Bruce Hales's answer: "Well, if they are good non-community staff, give them a 50% pay rise tomorrow and tell them to stop complaining or leave. The other thing is I've always believed in a workplace that wages are confidential. The person in charge of the pay office should have no contact with anybody in the organization about salary levels or [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4076s) other benefits except the boss. Just the boss. You understand that round here, don't you? This is mafia town, isn't it?"

So I mean, we're just sitting here discussing how someone who just comes out of school gets a job above you with a much higher pay and has no clue what to do. Like that's what I'm talking about.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4103s)

They wouldn't even have considered putting you in there because for a start, you're a woman.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4110s)

I wouldn't consider bringing up the conversation when I was there because I just thought, "Well no, they've got me because of my skill and my experience, but I'm still nothing to them." I'm just here to do a job and if they could have found a brethren man to do the same job, they would have and I wouldn't have been hired, nor would anybody else be [hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4140s) outside of the community. But they don't have that skill set, they don't have the knowledge, they don't have the experience because their education system is really very small compared to what you can learn in the world.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4161s)

And they don't want that because that enables critical thinking where they capitalize on your critical thinking to turn it inwards. So you are constantly critically analyzing yourself and therefore you don't have the energy nor the time to start criticizing the system. And that's why they don't allow higher grades of education, because then you'll start to turn your critical thinking towards the system.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4187s)

No, now they have their own extracurricular courses that they take that makes them feel like they're having university degrees, which they're not. Sorry, but they're not. I want to get to the other half of this quote. So this is on the other end of the spectrum with regarding community, like PBCC members. "How should we be handling requests for increased pay?"

So Bruce Hale's answer is: "Good question. If there are any staff that you're paying any less than double the minimum wage, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4217s) should put them up by 50% of what you're paying them now and see if you can tie it into productivity. But if you've got staff, you must pay them what they need. That comes back to the question before about examining their household budget."

So a complete different response and how he addressed it, right? Whereas a non-community member is just like, "You double their pay and then if they don't like it they can leave." It's just a stark black and white difference of how they're approaching the system.

And so then you get some of these young kids that are just coming off school, coming in. We've had lots of stories come in about how cocky they are with how much they're getting paid. And so that's [how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4263s) pay raises and what they're getting paid is being talked about, because these people get very cocky when they're taught to look down on non-PBCC members, right? And how they come down on them is through how much they're getting paid because they're so money orientated. They're so wealth orientated. They're not orientated on intelligence and good skills. They are obsessed [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4293s) motivated by wealth and money. So that's what they use to show that they're above you. It's sad.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4307s)

Yeah, it really is.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4309s)

And it's not right. So I mean, if anybody is experiencing this and you're still working for them, I mean I guess the first thing would be you have the right to lodge a human rights complaint, right? You can go to HR. If you don't get anywhere there, there's people up above that you can go and lodge these complaints to, because I do think this is another avenue that needs to be addressed.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4334s)

Yeah, definitely. Or reach out to us and we can share your story.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4340s)

So how long did it take for you to recover and recuperate from working with them? Did it take you a bit to bounce back, mental health wise?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4355s)

Yes. So I actually ended up taking a few months off work because I was just a mess. I felt like I didn't know who I was. I was so dehumanized that I was so scared to go into another workplace and feel the same way. And I knew that that wouldn't happen, but I was worried that I would [apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4385s) for a role and I would go back into a brethren business.

And it also took a while for me to feel like myself again and to feel like I could just be myself and nobody was thinking that I was the scum of the earth. And I find that so sad that I felt that way, [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4422s) to me it was just a year and I was not part of the community, so I could resign and walk away from it and just go, "Well, you guys are quite damaging, but I've got a good life outside of this." I've got good support. Even though I don't feel like myself, I know who I am and I can get back to that and be okay.

But yeah, it did take a while. And I still, that's when I started seeing Ben's videos that I was just like, "Oh god, there's so much stuff that I haven't spoken about." And it's been what, six, seven years since I've left. And I'll notice it if I'm walking down the street. So I'm in a rural town now so there's no [brethren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4483s) where we are. But if I'm ever in a bigger town or a bigger city and I see people from the Brethren community, my heart stops for a second and I'm just like, "Oh god, that was such a terrible time." And it wasn't necessarily each individual person. I mean there are some beautiful people there, absolutely.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4510s)

Yeah.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4511s)

Who are kind and were happy and okay with getting to know people outside of their community. But there were also a lot of people who were really pissed off about it and didn't want us there, didn't want to look at us, didn't want to talk to us. Like the amount of times that I would go to say hello and put my hand out to shake their hand, well they're not going to shake my hand. They would just look at [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4541s) and keep walking.

And I just thought, "Okay." And so I think about how it made me feel, and that's a fraction, I imagine, of how some people within the community would feel because it's not only their work life, it's 24 hours a day, seven days a week for their entire lives. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4571s) wonder how many of them sit there and question, "Is this normal? Should I be feeling this way? Should I be believing this?"

And what I think about is it's not even, I don't think that the teachings in the Brethren have really got anything to do with, you [know,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4602s) Jesus Christ. I think that it's all about control, indoctrination and everything around that. And they use God as a, "Oh yeah, because we're doing it for him." Yeah, no you're not.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4627s)

Yeah. Before we go, I just want to, and I do think that this is something I wanted to say on air before, is I do think that there should be a database made of brethren businesses and made available to people. That is no different than people boycotting a store or brands like Coca-Cola, Target, whatever. There's many people that have gone underneath the scrutiny of certain things that they believe in or have said and have been [boycotted.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4657s)

It has nothing to do, it's not defamatory. It is literally having a database giving people the choice of like, "Do I want to support these people or do I not want to support these people?" It's no different than looking in your name tag and being like, "Ah, you know what? That was made in China. I don't want to support that. I want to support someone local." Well, why don't you support China? People choose not to support that due to some of their morals. It is no different than the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. They have morals that [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4687s) inhumane.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4693s)

They're extremely homophobic, yes.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4694s)

Exactly. So number one, we could even place it just right on that they're anti-gay. And so how many people boycott people who are anti-gay? It is no difference. And I agree, there needs to be a database that people can go in and research and say, "Hey, I want to make sure that I'm not supporting these people because I don't want to."

That is what we're all about right now in society. People are opening up their ears, they're opening up their eyes, understanding that they don't [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4724s) their money going to someone who is anti-gay, homophobic, racist, very misogynistic, support and hide pedophilia. And I do think that this is something, so if anybody's out there and wants to have this task, go right ahead. Email me and say that you're up for the task. I do think this database needs to be available. And to the PBCC, no, it's not defamatory. It is about holding you accountable to your morals. And [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4754s) you have these morals, there is a cause and effect because of it. It's no different than anything else.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4761s)

I'm going to correct you on one thing. They're not morals. They're beliefs. Morals infer something is right against something that is wrong. The things that they follow are not morals because they're not right. They are beliefs. And morals usually pertain to something that they follow for a reason because it's biblically sound or something like that. What they follow are called beliefs. They're not morals.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4788s)

Even atheists have morals. Like it's a code of, it's a similar language all throughout, right?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4794s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4795s)

Yeah, I agree with you Carman. Did you, you were going to tell us a story about some homophobic incidents, Floss?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4802s)

Oh, yeah. I understood really how it was kind of almost beyond homophobia. Like, it kind of almost blew my mind. Probably one, because to me, there's no, I've never cared about anybody's sexual orientation or the way that they identify [themselves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4833s) It's, you're a good person or you're a bad person. Anything else apart from that, I don't care.

And so, this is, I was having a conversation with my boss at the time and he was talking about that he'd gone for a walk maybe with his family or they'd gone somewhere and his son needed to go to the bathroom and they didn't want to go into the pub that they were walking past. You know, not really their thing. They didn't want to be around those people. And I thought, "Yeah, okay, fair enough."

And so he went into a public toilet with his son and he had mentioned that two men from the pub had gone to use the restroom. Now they weren't in there doing anything, they were having a wee and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4899s) was it. And so my boss didn't see it that way. He saw it as if two men are going into the bathroom together, they're going to go and have homosexual relations.

And he said that he was absolutely traumatized. He was shaking, his son was shaking, he was trying not to vomit. And that he had to speak to one of the people at the church to try and move past this incident. And I said [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4929s) him, "But all they were doing was having a wee, they weren't doing anything." And he's like, "No, you don't understand. Like it was just, the thought of it is just so horrific, like what they were doing in there." And I just couldn't, it just didn't make sense to me.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4948s)

Where's the evidence? Did you see anything?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4952s)

And I just thought, if you can work yourself up so much so that you have to go and speak to an elder in the church about seeing two men literally just going to use the bathroom. And like who cares if they went in there to do anything else?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4974s)

Like how high the fear is on their indoctrination.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4978s)

Yeah, and also how wild the narratives are that they spin. Like it was the same reason you don't go to gyms, because all that happens in the bathrooms is sex.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4989s)

I've never seen that in my life. And I couldn't think of a more...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4993s)

Uncomfortable or unsanitary place to have sex.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=4997s)

Yeah. But, yeah, it was just this, the way that he was so worked up about it. And there was a conversation around it at work on how terrifying it was. And I thought, "Oh, my God, well, you really wouldn't want to see Mardi Gras."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5018s)

Yeah.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5019s)

Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, Mardi Gras would absolutely tip them over the edge. But it's the fear runs so deeply that they create this narrative when nothing is happening.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5037s)

And this is where a lot of the mental health issues suffer from. I don't know if he suffered from mental health, but a lot of them stem from that. And then they go hand in hand with alcohol. So you've got this awful mix or a cocktail of a human because they are constantly imagining or with the fears that have been put in them, on top of that alcohol which accentuates that.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5064s)

Yeah, I mean it was really clear to see that there was, I mean homophobia there was completely normal. And I mean I certainly didn't agree with it. I thought that was really disgusting. I thought that the way that the women were treated was wrong and really sad. But the belief systems that they have, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5095s) just... are so out of this world in that they're so quick to make those that aren't the perfect cookie-cutter of what they want to be less than nothing.

And when it comes to mental health, I mean I saw people with mental health issues constantly. [You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5127s) could see people that were clearly depressed, you could see people that were clearly anxious, you could see people that were wanting to jump out of their own skin and do something else and see something else. And I would have loved to have been able to just grab onto them and shake them and say, "There's a whole world that you're missing out on [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5157s) of these beliefs and these rules that you're following that only really come from one man, one family."

And whatever he says goes. And it's got nothing to do with God, it's got nothing to do with religion, it's got to do with control. I was Christian when I was younger and I decided it's not really for me, [but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5191s) the people that I was going to church with were beautiful people. You don't have to be religious to be a good person. If you believe that there is a god and there is a heaven and a hell, my belief is if there is a god and he is a just god, regardless of whether I have spent my life believing in him or not, if I [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5221s) to the pearly gates and there he is, if I've been a good person and treated others with kindness and respect, then why would I be sent to an eternity in hell?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5231s)

Yeah, when you've already done a year and a bit, was it, at UBT?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5235s)

Yeah.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5236s)

Absolutely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5240s)

This same thing with my dad is like, I remember him saying, "You're gonna spend eternity without the family." I'm like, "Perfect, sign me up." I couldn't spend 24 years of my life with my family, let alone an eternity. That would be hell.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5258s)

We're so grateful that you came on, Floss. I guess we could leave this with, you met Bruce Hales and you didn't come out feeling like you were on top of the world. Instead you came out...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5274s)

Is it a yay or a nay?

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5276s)

It's a hard no, thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5283s)

That seems to be the story that everybody gives, that if they do meet him, you're not magically transformed and feeling like you just met the god of the world.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5295s)

It probably would have been kinder to just spit on me, really.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5302s)

He probably would have because he thought you're a whore.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5305s)

Yeah, I really think they need to look up that definition.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5310s)

Yeah, just to put it out there for on the record, there's nothing wrong with being a whore. The difference is, the thing you're missing here, it's consensual. Consent is something that is really misunderstood in the brethren. It doesn't matter if you're a whore or what you are, it's consent.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5327s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5330s)

Well thanks so much, Floss, that was interesting.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5332s)

Yeah, thank you very, it was very enlightening. And I think these stories are so important coming forward from those that are not a PBCC member and coming from the actual public. Because you've got no vendetta. That's what we get told we have, we have this vendetta. I don't have a vendetta. I just want to know that my nieces and nephews and any extended family I have in there are safe. That is my vendetta, so to speak, is that I just want safety.

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5363s) it's super sad to hear that this is what they treat non-members like. That is not Christianity. I get to the point where I don't even have words anymore because it's just so shocking how they treat humans.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5383s)

Yeah. Well, there's very little human decency, unfortunately.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5387s)

Yeah. And so, hopefully things change. I mean, we've got a lot of things on the go here and working through things. And I'm sure one day there'll be a breakthrough. And it is people like you that come on and pour your heart on here that allow these changes to take place. So thank you so much, Floss.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5404s)

Oh, thank you. Yes. Thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5407s)

Take care, everyone. Until next time.

### [**Floss**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TAMQtQdT7w&t=5410s)

Bye-bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
