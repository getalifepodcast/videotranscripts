## Summary

This was a tear jerker episode as "Jane" continues telling her experience of teaching at OneSchool Global. We hear the all too familiar stories of alcohol and wonder if the PBCC will listen and make changes, especially after the latest car crash that happened, killing 4 people. "Jane" expresses her concerns on their views of the environment and this leads us into the hypocrisy of their RRT charity that puts a mask on when supporting and pursuing the face of their "charitable" deeds. She describes the political conversations with these children and knows she couldn't have taught through another election!
Jane sends us into tears with her message to those that run OneSchool Global. Part 2 of this interview covered absolutely everything that lights a fire under the ex-members to demand change. Our loving families are inside this cult and don't realize what they are a part of. Will our voices, collectively, be enough to bring change to the future generation?
We welcome each and every teacher, those who have worked for the PBCC and anyone who has suffered at the hands of this extremist and destructive cult to come forward and use their voice to bring change.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=0s)

This is the Get A Life Podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=6s)

This is a continuation and part two from episode 107 with our anonymous OneSchool Global teacher.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6N3qr1JqpNw%26t%3D13s)

The kids would talk about drinking. So I remember, you know, one of the things is the school goes from year three to the end of high school. And often you will teach across depending, you know, sometimes you might teach a primary class or whatever. You certainly, the kids are right there. So you're exposed to the primary kids. The primary kids would talk about drinking as in they'd make little references and the thing is you know with kids those are the red flags when a child discusses something which is developmentally not [within](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=43s) their range, that's a red flag.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=46s)

So how young do you think that would be that they would be discussing that?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=48s)

Well, I was aware that they would have, I think is it sherry at the meetings from, yeah, very like the year three those kids were. And they would always come to Monday, it was like you would know the kids would be super tired because they've had this huge weekend. I remember a particular kid referring to partying and he was in primary school, so maybe year four, year five. But in terms of actual alcohol on campus, I remember an incident where we had like, you know, an end of term [celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=79s), so a day where the kids were not doing normal school activities.

And leading up to it, they had, we had a day where for whatever reason teachers were on campus, kids weren't on campus, but some of them were there rehearsing. And it was very clear that one of the students was going out to his mum's car with all of his friends, doing something out there regularly. Like they were going out to the car park, coming back in, and as the day progressed, he became more and more [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=109s) clearly intoxicated.

And there was another time where there was an event and the kids were, I mean, you know, growing up in Australia, that joke of having a party and someone's got a drink of some sort and they fall and the one thing they do is make sure that their drink doesn't spill. I remember the kids having cans of, that's another thing. At a normal school, particularly a primary school, you wouldn't see kids being served soft drink so openly. They [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=139s) soft drinks, so the kids would be plied with sugary drinks. But these kids running around or moving around with cans the whole time, a can in their hand. And then there was an incident where the boys left the campus, so they disappeared.

Because I had been able to form enough of a relationship with the kids that they didn't feel the need to be so secretive. Yeah. They told me that the boys had left. So I reported that to leadership because clearly you can't have kids off campus, it's not safe. They eventually turned back up. They were called into the office of the principal where they were so [intoxicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=188s) that that leader was…and you know, herein lies the problem with the school.

 I remember the leader expressing that they could barely stand and that she was worried that one of them was going to vomit. Nothing came from that. So it was like, oh, we don't have any proof that they were drinking. I mean, it was very obvious that they were. Another time, I remember that the kids were bringing alcohol on campus, they got caught and got an internal [suspension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=223s) which involved spending their time at the primary school, which is just like another part of the building, where they were almost like heroes because everyone just thought it was hilarious that they'd done this thing.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=236s)

No, yeah, it's kind of applauded. It was the same thing with my high school. The kid that would sneak off, and he looked like an adult because he had managed, you know, he's shaving already kind of thing. So he used to go and buy the alcohol at lunch and the kids would, yeah, and every time they were caught they were like applauded. It was like, uh-huh, let's try and do it again.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=255s)

There was another campus where the kid that got up and left my class was known to have a really big problem in that he arrived to school intoxicated every day. He was hiding alcohol on campus at school. I mean, it's so devastating because...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=276s)

What has led them to that point?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=279s)

How are they going to have any kind of a decent future? We know that alcohol is inherently linked to domestic abuse.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=285s)

Yeah. But then my question is why? Like what harm had that kid suffered to be in that position? Like I know that I was heavily addicted to, well not addicted, but I was, I would have been down that path. I was heavily, often ply myself with alcohol in the brethren situation because I couldn't cope with what I was going through. So it makes me, like I feel, I feel sorry for that kid. Like what was he suffering?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=313s)

Yeah, look, I've been in school situations where kids are smoking a little bit of pot or, but I've never been in a situation where you've got a kid who is, you know, like clearly really intoxicated every day. That wasn't at a campus that I taught at..

I don't think they really did anything about it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=339s)

I was going to say, unfortunately nothing probably would have come from that because, and in our growing up, Jane, we often heard that a leader who was a known drunk, a past elective, so he, he said that alcohol makes a strong man stronger and a weak man weaker. And it was kind of like the story you read as a child of the emperor's new clothes. If you didn't agree with that, well, you were a weak man.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=365s)

You heard that repeated, Jane? 

**OSG Teacher**

Yeah, the kids would say it.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=368s)

Yeah, yeah, there you go. It's their instant permission to, well, I want to be a strong man, right?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=373s)

Exactly. The unspoken implication of that is that if you're not drinking, you're trying to hide something. Yeah. Because I think there was also, sorry, that's maybe not quite right, but there's also a saying that said something about speaking the truth or...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=389s)

Yeah, no one speaks the truth like babes, something and alcoholics. That was another drunks, babes and sucklings and I think one of the elect vessels, I know I'm not quoting it, but someone somewhere added, and drunks. And it was like, okay, this is excusing us. Yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=407s)

Last Easter, there was a horrible car crash in Wangaratta where there was a death involved. This Easter here in North America, in the States, there was a horrible car crash where a member of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church killed four people. And I'm going to read something here that was out on social media of someone who knew what happened. It says,

 "I don't know who [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=437s) may have seen on Channel 2 news at 6 about the bad auto crash at the Dayton airport. Some may know that I work part-time there driving rental cars from our prep lot to the rental garage."

"The vehicle that was hit was our shuttle van. The SUV that hit it ran the red light so fast that it almost broke the van in half. There were five guys in the van, co-workers of mine and friends. Four of my friends were killed instantly. The fifth is in critical condition as well as the driver of the SUV. [Please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=468s) let your family and friends know how much they mean to you. We never know what tomorrow may bring."

And I just want to say that the driver of this vehicle, this wasn't, that was his second accident. He had had an accident, a hit and run before this. That person followed him and then this happened. And again, alcohol was, they are thinking alcohol was a factor. I have to put it like that until it's actually publicized. But again, we are, we're seeing these horrible, horrible incidents [happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=498s) that stem from exactly what you witnessed and what you have heard from other teachers.

And this isn't the first time we've heard this. We had another teacher that was on that had, there was alcohol in their water bottles at school and nothing was done about it. At some point, the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church have to wake up and realize the damage this alcohol behavior and acceptance brings to these children because they end up [growing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=529s) up and being exactly what just recently happened this last Easter. So it's two Easters in a row where the last one someone died, this one was four people died. This guy's LinkedIn profile actually has a picture that says, "The need for speed."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=548s)

I mean, there's so much about these things that's disturbing. I know that, and I, you know, I don't want to talk out of turn because I'm clearly not Brethren. And so a lot of the things that I think are just observations and assumptions, but I think...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=570s)

Feel free to make them. It's so kind of like, it's so validating to hear it from a non-third person perspective. So just make them.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=578s)

It's definitely the case that women are often given the responsibility of driving so that if they get caught, they lose their license, you know, it doesn't matter so much if they lose their license.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=589s)

Yeah, and also the women didn't drink as much as the men. So yes, going home from the lunches on Sunday, which the Brethren call breaks, yeah, it was common that three or four of the people that you had for the break, the women would jump in the car and drive because they only had one. I mean...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=605s)

The women still do have quite an issue inside there, but yes, I mean, I can see how the women would be the ones that would have to drive. But yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=613s)

I remember one year, so we would have at the end of the year like a Christmas celebration. And it would usually be they'd send us off to have lunch somewhere. And, you know, at some point during the time, the Brethren men, because women don't have any position of, you know, power, so the CAs would turn up and they'd say thanks for the year and da-da-da-da-da. But then this one year they actually booked a place and we all ate [together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=643s) in that the Brethren sat at a separate table but we were all in the same room, which was a little bit unusual. That did not, my experience prior.

And I remember that day that the women who were wives and then also sometimes the young women have positions within the school, so admin until they get married. Sometimes, you know, there are women that never get married and so they end up being quite old and yeah still. They got really drunk, [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=674s) being kind of horrified that these girls, and because you know, as a female you kind of understand the vulnerability that comes along with losing your capacity to look after yourself. So that was quite horrifying to me. Also because it's work, you know, I wouldn't get drunk at a work do. Generally, I mean, some people do, but I, you know. 

**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**

Did you ever witness racism in there? 

**OSG Teacher**

Yes, very racist. And that speaks to that suggestion before that the people who survive are people who, so the non-Brethren teachers that survive in the system are often people whose values align. I mean, it's a difficult situation to teach in an environment where you feel contempt. And so you know, when you hear a child in year three discussing how women [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=734s) inferior and that's why they can't, you know, be in charge of stuff or whatever.

So you've got a kid in year three who's, you know, possibly not the brightest kid ever. So there's no indication that this child is in any way intelligent because they're a male. They have this sense of superiority and will really openly say obnoxious things, uneducated. There was a lot of that. And as a female teaching in the environment, so I thought of this before, I've [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=765s) writing little notes as we're talking. One of the risks of being in the school was there was this constant threat that the kids would turn on you. So you have this feeling that if you did something to upset one of them, you know, you asked before if I felt like some kids had power, if you did something to upset one of them, they would all band together and then you'd be one of the teachers that was gotten rid of and they'd make something up.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=789s)

Possible. And they would do anything. Like it happened at Sydney school and they essentially found because this teacher suddenly like snapped and said, "Well, what if I do have a partner? What if I am gay?" And the kids banded together and that teacher was disappeared. I think he took them to fair work and actually won because of discrimination, but...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=812s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=812s)

Yeah, it happens all the time. It happened all the time. So when I was in year seven, there was a teacher that essentially said they went to the Mardi Gras parade and I know he was disappeared, like disappeared for bringing that up. And there was a lot of contention between kids not liking that person anyway. So they were like, "Well, here's a way to do it." And yeah, he was disappeared.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=836s)

Look, I don't think you could ever be, although you can't even, you can't outwardly suggest that we should be worried about the environment. They're so anti any of that stuff. Like I remember, you know, doing a, discussing recycling and there's this really palpable opposition to the idea that we need to care about the environment in any way.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=870s)

What year would that have been? What grade, like what year? And as in year level?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=875s)

Yeah, yeah, what year level. Oh, I don't even remember. I just, it's, it was a given to me.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=883s)

It's just very interesting because we've come again and this is another thing that we come up against, right, where they just have no, because they believe in this rapture that's coming on, they don't need to worry about the world around them. Yet if you watch on RRT, their famous charity that's set up to keep their, their status, the things, the people that they go and support are the people that will support them, completely go against the teachings that are taught in their school. And it's the hypocrisy of it that [angers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=914s) us ex-members, that when you see RRT members going out and supporting environmental things that they don't even believe in themselves.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=922s)

Yeah, and it was like the same way that they made a statement to why they left the Hawkesbury where I live, and they were like, "aware of current climate concerns." I'm like, you haven't, it's never been anything further from the truth. You don't give a rat's ass about anyone outside of your church, let alone the environment.

So I just want to run through a list of things that I've sort of jotted down that I've heard from recent leaders of OneSchool Global, currently workers of OneSchool Global. And one of them was around the cameras. Now recently I heard that the police were called to OneSchool Global because of cameras in the boys toilets, which was an interesting, I think, had you, did you hear of that or, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=973s) mean, obviously campus, so it's a different, it's probably a different school. I don't know where you teach, that taught at, but it's OneSchool Global essentially.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=981s)

Doesn't surprise me, in that I mean, I don't think we had cameras in the toilets. We had cameras in all of the rooms. In the time that I was there, as a response to certain incidents, they would put more cameras in.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1009s)

 So you know, and I do believe that this was because of an incident of a boy nearly drowning in a toilet from being bullied. So from what I've heard, this was in response to that.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1018s)

That's the reaction. I mean, it's not funny at all, but no, I know, but it's always a reaction like that, you know. There's a behavior that you don't like, so rather than address the behavior or what is facilitating the behavior, let's put in a thousand cameras so that they can't do it or that we can catch it happening.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1038s)

Which is essentially what this person that reached out said. And she's, and it said here that, you know, that there are cameras in every school and I've heard that these are monitored for the whole school day by a roster of parents and board members and where they've heard of members actually contacting the school to tell teachers that the students are doing something wrong. I mean, in terms of privacy, you're sending your kids to a certain school without knowing that there are a plethora of Brethren members monitoring your kids at school. I just, it all sounds very much, I mean, it's very problematic.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1076s)

Schools are not, one of the things that I've, because leading up to this, I've sort of been thinking about, you know, things that are important. One of the notes that I'd written down is that, you know, in Australia we had the Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, and the thing that they actually identified as being the biggest risk factor was access to kids. So in a school situation, anyone that isn't, you know, approved, that doesn't [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1109s) a “working with children” or is a registered teacher shouldn't have access to that stuff. And yet here you are, we're saying that people outside of the school are accessing information on kids. That's really problematic. That's disturbing.

I know cameras were everywhere. The reason that I say I'm not that surprised is because it was divulged to us that they were not only recording video, but they were recording sound. And they said because it's not lawful, "Oh, you know, we can't use it for anything." But they're still listening. And why? There was very little understanding of privacy for teachers or students.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1156s)

And I guess that all stems from that mentality that we are the chosen people, we are special. So at the end of the day, we own you. You're working for us, you're our property, you're, you know, like that whole mentality that is roughly in the community. Back on the camera note, yep. Also, like we knew that all our laptops growing up in there and our phones were all bought through UBT, were all monitored heavily, edited, like heavily controlled [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1186s) that you couldn't access anything within the outside world. You couldn't download apps, you couldn't do anything. Like it was what they, what you're allowed to have, which was purely communication. That was it.

Even to the point where now they have, WhatsApp have introduced a thing called like a social media sharing platform where you can have channels where you can, you know, we can put out the podcast to put their thing on there, like different little things like that. So now they have made everybody get rid of WhatsApp and move over to Signal. And this has happened time and time again throughout history. When they [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1216s) had it, when we moved to BlackBerries at BlackBerry Messenger, and that was moved to WhatsApp because Messenger did a similar thing where it became, you know, obviously big companies are trying to get on board with social media and be a part of that world and so they evolved. But the Brethren don't like that, obviously, because that means access to the real world.

And so this person has reached out and said laptops are monitored, they know, by the IT company and parents, and I'm assuming Plymouth Brethren Christian Church members. It's where they receive [screenshots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1247s), and I quote, "every 30 seconds and are alerted to keywords or searches." And I hear this for a fact because a girl that we helped escape from year 12, she was, you know, very, very intelligent, she won a scholarship and did all this stuff, tried help like setting up and leaving, and she was found out. And there's only one way that that could have been, is because they were alerted to her keyword searches.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1275s)

Wow. Yeah. I don't think there's any secret about that monitoring. I know...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1282s)

It should be a huge red flag. Like the invasion of privacy by people that aren't even approved to work with kids, like you say. Yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1292s)

Look, we had a program that we used where we could view students' screens. We could see their, so if they were emailing during that monitoring, I know that there was an email sent out at one point reminding teachers that it wasn't ethical for them to monitor a student's computer outside of their own class. So people would be monitoring students' computers either outside of school hours or outside [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1332s) class time. Certainly, you know, they have the self-directed learning, so they have the period of time when they're in the learning center. They would monitor what they were doing then.

Those things are things that I found really disturbing because a lot of teachers loved being able to view what was going on. You know, that's not sort of how I see it. I know as [as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1362s) a young person, I would have been horrified at the idea that everything I did and said was being watched.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1367s)

But then also on top of that, it gives, like I'm thinking about the kid that was clearly suffering and reached out to a help service, it really inhibits that. Like you know that you're being watched and you already know that it's a big issue to contact the real world or the outside world for help. Yeah, like it would bring it back again, insulate even more, right?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1391s)

Yeah, I mean, look, I think that's one of the things for me that the takeaway that was really disturbing is that when I first started, I felt like there should have been a really clear separation between how the school ran and the school's legal responsibility to meet duty of care and child safety and all of that stuff, and then Brethren needs. It seemed to me that there [shouldn't,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1421s) that the school should have been able to say, "This is our legal requirement, that is a non-negotiable," except that's not the reality of it. That's not how it works.

People are, look, I'm going to say people get paid really well. The truth is my experience having left is that the pay wasn't that good and the conditions weren't that good. I now work in an environment where I'm getting paid significantly more. I have less responsibility. So, you know, I think that's chaos.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1455s)

Yeah, but it's one of the things that happens when you're there is that you're also then isolated because in a normal teaching situation, teachers are part of a community, a broader community. The reality of that is that you're sort of a little bit isolated because it is so different to anywhere else. And so, I mean, you kind of get indoctrinated, I guess. Certainly people that have been there for a long time, it was [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1485s) obvious to me that they no longer had an objective perspective and didn't really know right from wrong a lot of the time.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1495s)

I guess, yeah, the lines would get blurred after a while if you're, like I said, you become desensitized. You know, it's like in the same way that when I left, you know, I never experienced horror other than the horror of being part of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church community. And I remember going with my friends to a haunted house thing and being absolutely and utterly terrified. And now, you know, I listen to true crime to help me sleep. Like it's, it's a very, if the original, you do become desensitized to it, right? Like you do. And in the same retrospect, in the same way with working in that community over a period of time, it becomes the normal.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1536s)

Just because I've just thought about, you asked before if I experienced any racism. I remember one time we had a new teacher starting and the teacher was dark-skinned. And we had a meeting where one of the leaders expressed that it would be good for the kids to be exposed to this kind of diversity. And I remember sitting there thinking, this is like a social experiment. This person is going to be crucified.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1566s)

Yeah, and unfortunately they were. Like I remember growing up, like not all, because some were very well able to stand up for themselves, but they, you are born in that community, you're inherently racist. And I, you know, I really struggled with it growing up because I'm like, there were elements to me that I didn't like about the way you thought and you're like, "Hang on, where does that come from?" You know, like, "What, that's a teaching from back then." You know.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1595s)

So do you know what, yeah, do you know how that worked out for the teacher?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1598s)

Lasted about two terms and then left because the person was dark-skinned and female. So that, you know, didn't have much going for them in the end.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1612s)

In terms of the community.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1614s)

Didn't understand the situation that they were walking into. I mean, you know, observationally, it is a lot easier for some people to teach in that environment than others depending on their heritage, what they look like culturally, which I guess is, you know, true of any teaching situation, but in this situation, really quite different. One of the other things is that the [community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1645s) is so full of hypocrisy. So like that thing of not voting. I remember at one point we were having an election and I'd never been in a situation where kids were so interested in what was going on politically.

And I said to a class, "But you guys don't vote, do you?" And one of the students then kind of coyly said, "We vote with the power of prayer," which was a bit of an eye-opener for me [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1675s) you know, that clearly seems absurd from the outside. But then, you know, as time went by, because they were so political, like wearing badges and everyone believed the same thing, I remember a student being very, very anxious that their desired leader wasn't going to be re-elected. And that student felt like it was to be the end of the world, that if that person didn't get in, the world was going to end. So you're just like trying to reassure, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1705s) making sure that you didn't express any of your own political views because then they'd all turn on you and you know, that would make life difficult.

Actually, one of the reasons I didn't want to stay any longer, I thought, "I can't bear to live through another federal election. It's horrifying and too much pressure to not," because you know, you have a bit of an off day where you're a little bit tired and the kids say something obnoxious and all you want to do is set them straight. You just want to say, "That's not right and people have different opinions and the world isn't going to end."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1744s)

Yeah, but then again, they're not taught how to have, they're not taught how to have that difference of opinion and they don't have those conversations where we can be in a room, a group of people in the same room, and have difference of opinions and have a discussion. They don't have that, right? It's all...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1762s)

Yeah, don't want to set themselves aside at all.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1765s)

Yeah, no. And also in a different perspective to that, growing up with those thoughts, you did think major, they did use major, I'm going to say like catalysts, like major events like elections or earthquakes or wars or they did use that in a very superstitious way to bring about the control on and in turn fear to keep you well within that community. Because if you ever leave it, you're not going to know [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1795s) the King of the North is going to come down, which is the opening of the seventh seal or whatever, you know, whatever superstitious, I know I'm not quoting that right. But they were always using like the George Bush going to the Middle East was the opening of this seal and this, we're up to this seal in the Bible.

Like that fear of, of we're already conscripted, we've already got the time set out for us. We're just going to listen to one man tell us when exactly we're lining up. And that could have been an election. Like I remember sitting in [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1826s) lounge room at my grandpa's where Bruce Hales was there and it was the time of the election where Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, like that government, the Labor government, where we had all been praying wouldn't get in. And you know, the power of prayer just wasn't powerful enough because they did get in. And he says in the lounge room, "Well, the Lord knew I needed a break from the media, so that's why he put them in." And that was his reasoning. And then from there on fluttered out to the rest of the community that this was for a break for our brother.

[Oh,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1856s) that's fine. Like you were always on eggshells not knowing what major event was going to take place and for what reasoning it had, whether it was the end of the world because Bruce Hales, the leader, was sitting in church meetings going, "It could be three years, it could be five years. I don't know. We don't know the day nor the hour, but that doesn't mean we don't know the time nor the month." Like they'd say things like that to throw you off and wringing that control, wringing that fear. Because if you can say to your followers, "I know [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1886s) the rapture is coming, it's three years. Just because I don't know the day nor the hour doesn't mean I don't know the time nor the month." You're like, "Well, I want to be around for that. I don't want to be left in what is going to be a catastrophic event." So that is why there is so much heightened anxiety with children growing up in the schools around things like a simple federal election where really...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1907s)

It's so, it's so strange for the kids to be so politically activated but then not participate in the system, so not vote. And then of course, you know, we know that actually they do influence the system significantly.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1929s)

Money talks, right?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1932s)

Corrupt, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1933s)

And yeah, right now with all of the stuff that's happening, the ATO raids and everything, I mean, are us attacking them is what they're calling it. This is all the end of the day. So this, that's the solace that they're giving them right now is, I've had a few insiders ring me and be like, "That's what they're telling them, that this is the end of the day."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1954s)

This is supposed to be what it's like.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1956s)

This is what it's supposed to be like. This is the end of the days. This is how it's going to be. And you know, like, could you imagine feeding that to like a five-year-old or a six-year-old? And that brain's not going to understand what those mean. I mean, I remember, I remember being getting told that and going into Sunday morning meeting and I was so scared that the earth was going to open up during Monday or Sunday morning communion and it would [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1986s) be swallowed.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=1988s)

And that, I mean, that's another thing. You know, having grown up in, it wouldn't, I don't think that it's reasonable to say as a Christian, because I don't think that myself or my family have ever really actively, you know, we've never gone to church or whatever. But I did go to a church school, my children have gone to church schools. I'm familiar with the Bible, I'm familiar with the concept of Christianity. And my [experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2019s) of it is acceptance and empathy and love. And that is not what...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2024s)

Everything the opposite of the Brethren.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2026s)

Yeah. It's very domineering and it comes from a base of feeling guilty and there's a really nasty thread. So that's one of the things too that I sort of, you know, initially wasn't apparent, but over time, this thread of contempt and a lack of empathy for each other. Yeah, the kids and [they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2057s) were, they could be really nasty and it was...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2060s)

It probably did come out in forms of humor, like humor, but poor forms of humor because I know myself was part of that, you know, ecosystem as they like to call it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2069s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2070s)

But on, yeah, yeah, okay, go down your list.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2074s)

Yeah, yeah. Keep going down your list.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2077s)

Yeah. So there was something else I wanted to bring up was, oh, yes. So did you ever experience any homophobia in terms of bullying? And was it quite obvious and confronting? Like, how was that?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2096s)

Yes. So I remember one of the first times, I mean, and I was aware of the fact that clearly it wasn't a choice. You couldn't choose to be gay. That wouldn't be accepted. I remember a class, I think it was a year eight or year nine class, and a girl, so we're talking about probably the very beginning of puberty, so still really a little girl. I remember a girl very loudly saying something [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2129s) the effect of what she thought should happen to a gay man. I think it was in reference to music. Like someone said something about music and they're like, "Oh, he's a whatever," and then, "You know, he should have been..."

It was quite a violent end that this girl suggested this person should come to. And I remember being horrified, not even just at the homophobia, but that a 14-year-old girl would suggest that something so violent should happen to anyone. I guess that's a little bit sexist in itself, that I was horrified that it was [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2161s) I considered to be a little girl.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2164s)

That is generic though. That's a very generic reaction. Just to share an experience from another teacher, she said they had like a little hand template, right? They had to write on each finger things, I think it was like what they wanted the world to be better at or what they want to get rid of to make the world a better place.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2187s)

Was that, is it a podcast we did? We did talk about it in a podcast. I'm just trying to think about...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2191s)

I never did that activity, but just talking about it, I can imagine because that is something that you learn with experience. It's like, "I'm not going to do that because if I do that, I'm going to hear things that I don't want to hear."

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2204s)

Yeah, that you'll have to listen, that I find really abhorrent.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2208s)

Yeah. Well, and this teacher said to me that one of the, I must be, it must have happened over a couple of things, but one of the most things that was written on one of the fingers was, "if we got rid of gay people, the world would be a better place."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2223s)

You know, that speaks, like the hypocrisy of it all. They'll have this idea about that, but then they'll love a musician who's, like I feel like Elton John is one of the accepted. I think they quite like a lot of his music.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2241s)

Yes, no, not anymore. They used to.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2243s)

Because now they've worked out that he's gay.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2246s)

Yes. I mean, it was pretty obvious, but yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2251s)

Yeah. Well, in another instance, we had an end of term activity. And the kids, you know, like they have these days where they'd raise money for some charity or something and there'd be a theme. And so the kids got dressed up as like workmen. We got a message shortly afterwards that there was to be no cross-dressing, and that was because the girls wore pants.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2284s)

This happened too with the, yeah. But the funny thing is though, in my class, the girls weren't allowed to wear pants, but the boy who, hilarious that they wanted, there was a skit that we did and one of the boys dressed up as a female. They all wanted me to do it. I was like, my internalized homophobia was like, "Absolutely not. I will not let them draw two conclusions." Like I already was teased for being poof and like gay and you know, at that point it was [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2314s) absolutely not. So they got the other kid in the class, which is hilarious to reflect back on now. He was also one of the biggest bullies but also highly effeminate. And yeah, it's just that the girls weren't allowed to put pants on, but the boys could, you know.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2328s)

Yeah, yeah. So that was a strange, I mean, and you know, how do you avoid that? Because, so absurd. What else? I mean, over the years, there were a couple of kids that, and as a teacher, you don't want to make assumptions. I don't want to assume that because a child, like I'm going to say a boy is a little bit effeminate, that that means that they're [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2359s) other than who they are. Like you don't want to make assumptions. But I know shortly before I left, a student revealed to another teacher, not myself, and so this kind of plays into that idea that you spend the whole time worried that you're going to hear something that you don't want to hear.

So this student revealed to a teacher that he was questioning his sexuality. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2389s) think, I believe actually he might have been questioning his gender, which is just like an added layer of complication.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2395s)

He must have been highly, highly intelligent or unaware because I was too afraid to tell anybody. It wasn't until like my cousin, who is also gay, said to me, "You're gay, then I know it, and so am I." Then I was like, "Okay, I can talk about it."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2410s)

Yeah, yeah. So, and I don't know who the student was. I have a couple of kids that I think it may have been. Certainly not the student that everyone obviously, like there were a couple of kids that, you know, you go, "Oh, that kid's clearly gay." Not one of those, not that student. But they also expressed that it wasn't an option and a sense that they weren't safe. That teacher reported it to the next level who said, "We're not going to say anything." And so you know, then you've got this kid existing in an environment where they are not allowed [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2465s) be who they are and where they don't feel safe because if, and you know, it's impossible to hide, if it gets out, they're going to be persecuted, they're going to be ostracized from their family....

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2479s)

I mean, living example of it, yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2481s)

And to me, that was devastating because it's impossible not to speculate to go, "Is that this kid? Is that that kid?" It was horrifying to me to know that it was any of them.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2491s)

I guess why I brought up the homophobia thing is that, and the reporting and like it's all kind of linked, right, is that I have a source who worked for OneSchool Global and OneSchool Australia and they've come forward and told me about a system they put in place or were putting in place. And it was announced, so like it was an organization that students could anonymously report bullying from an outside, like to an outside organization, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2521s) third party, not the Brethren. And so they got the person in, she came to the precinct and this person spent the whole day with her filming her, creating content, and they were going to use to push her platform.

And then one of the Brethren looked at her, found her on social media and found out she was a lesbian. And then they dropped it completely and pushed instead to have a smart sheet, which I think they still use today, with which students could anonymously report bullying instead. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2551s) then the smart sheet is the link that's on their global website you can see today. So they instead, they were like, "Hang on, hang on, like no, we can't fully vet everybody, so let's just keep it all internal." And yeah, I just, I guess I wanted to put that out there to ask your thoughts on that and yeah, which will lead into something else I want to chat to you about. Yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2576s)

I mean, look, Australian schools have to provide, it is law that you provide a space that is safe and doesn't discriminate and all of that stuff. So to work in an environment where, you know, you're clearly not doing that is pretty awful. Well, you know, that wasn't reported even though if it had, if it had been me that the student had come to, I would have had the distinct feeling that they weren't safe. And I would have felt very clearly that that needed to be reported. It wasn't reported because reporting would be worse than the situation they're in already because then they would definitely, you know, what the fear is of being found out. So if you report it, they're found [out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2636s)

I know there was a leader, like I said before, who did some mandatory reporting and got a lot of grief and ended up, you know, leaving.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2648s)

Yes. And I know that their family was affected by it, like yeah, to a point where the Brethren made it very difficult for them. And I do know, like a source has said to me, and I quote, "Staff aren't allowed to suggest any support services such as Headspace to kids in crisis or offer support to parents."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2668s)

Yeah, you know, often what happens is these things come in place after there's a bit of a breach. So I know there was a regional campus that had a student who was suffering from some pretty serious mental health issues that led into forms of self-harm. And that student was allowed to attend counselling and support outside of the Brethren. But I don't know that that continued for very long. And so there's always this reaction.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2712s)

Well, that's right. And there is another or something very similar. I don't know if it's the same person, but a source has told me that they had counselling, which then the counsellor, obviously being non-Brethren and fully aware of their profession and their duties as a professional to report, then heard or then discovered that the person then opened up about the sexual abuse that was happening, who then reported, then obviously authorities, the police got involved. And I think that person's maybe [even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2743s) but maybe I won't say that actually because I don't want to confuse stories.

But yeah, essentially then it was all cut. Like that's why it was absolutely not allowed to, like you say, it's a reaction to something happening by them opening up a little bit and then like, "No, hang on, this is opening up a big can of worms that we don't want to happen and if in turn it's going to affect our name." So pull back and create new rules around it in which, you know, this source has said staff are not allowed to suggest any support services. And then also went on [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2773s) say they want a list of names of any professionals that the students are seeing outside of school, which isn't that a breach of confidentiality?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2780s)

Oh yeah, there's not much by way of privacy or respect for privacy, that's for sure. And on that subject of reacting, one of the things I think is you assume, or I certainly did when I started, that there are rules and that the rules are the same for everyone. But once I was there for a little while, you know, we'd have these kind of national assemblies [where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2810s) the different states would share stuff. And then you'd go, "Hang on a second, they're doing drama? How come, like in the state that I'm in, I do drama?" Or so across different sections.

And then in the time that I was there, you know, we have a subject that the kids were allowed to do and then something would happen and it would be cancelled. They'd no longer do that subject because yes...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2837s)

Early childhood, good.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2838s)

No, no, not that I'm, but I mean, it actually happened more than once. So like, you know, we'd have some event or some subject that they were allowed to do via, via distance ed that would then be cancelled or some extracurricular thing where we'd have teachers coming in and taking individual lessons, that'll be cancelled, tutoring, that'll be [cancelled.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2869s) But then you see in another state, they're still doing it. So my understanding of that is that it's very centralized. It's not like, you know, small groups are controlled and it's not one big network where the rules apply to everyone and it's open and everyone understands the rules. I feel like the rules are always in a state of flux.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2891s)

Yeah. And I think, I think they do bring that all together every now and then to try and like put it smashed across the board. Like I remember all of a sudden the girls went out to do early childhood studies at my school and we all knew that that stemmed from the Gosford campus. Somebody who's studying, they blamed it on early childhood, a girl that was in that year 10, 11, 12, that age group when he did it, fell pregnant. And from one of my friends that have left the Brethren that she did early childhood, she said, "You know that if you were doing early childhood, it's not from the early childhood studies that made you fall pregnant."

Like you were caring for a baby for however many weeks, like those fake dolls. And she said you wanted to throw that thing. There was nothing about that that made you want to have children.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2947s)

Yeah, and but that's, that's because the Brethren men are in charge of, "Well, it must be because they do early childhood, so let's cancel that." And that was that. We all knew that that's why they didn't. And but saying that, Sydney school still did it at a certain point. So it was very, like you say, it's not, it's open to whoever has the most power, I think.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2967s)

I mean, I think too, there's, there are, there's conflict with curriculum and Brethren beliefs. So the Australian curriculum says that kids need to learn about Indigenous Australians. Yeah, yeah. Then, you know, different cultures. There was something else that I was thinking which...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2992s)

The Brethren have no respect for what, I mean...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=2995s)

I remember when I was there, one of the teachers trying to get them to do a Welcome to Country.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3001s)

Yeah, I would not have got down very...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3005s)

Standard, very standard at any other school, happens all the time now. Yeah, no, didn't go. It was like a complete, you may as well have, you know...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3015s)

Blasphemed, yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3018s)

Yeah, lots of resistance to the suggestion that you would acknowledge...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3023s)

Yeah, yeah, that's right. You would acknowledge that, you know, their white supremacist ideas are not...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3030s)

Sorry, environmental concerns. So that is part of the Australian curriculum. And you know, there's a lot of resistance to that because, I don't know, is there, there's some sort of thing about taking what you want from the land or the earth or...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3048s)

Well, they do say the, you know, spoil the Egyptians. Anybody outside of the Brethren are classified as Egyptians. So like, like the Israelites that fled Egypt was the Israelites, whenever the people fled Egypt, they took everything they could, the Hebrews, they took everything from the Egyptians. And that's their whole mentality is the feeding off the Egyptians. God, it makes me sound like a terrible Bible studies student, but it's been a while. But the whole, that whole mentality though, but this is what I want to point out, the hypocrisy, and that makes so much, so much of us so angry about the Rapid Relief Team, the fake charity that they've set up, is that they're like acknowledging NAIDOC Day.

"And we acknowledge NAIDOC Day." I'm like, "You don't care about First Nations people. You don't care about it. You campaigned against, sorry dame, you campaigned against everything that represented." 

Like, and I remember the hatred that they had for that community, for [any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3108s) community there isn't their own, or that is confronting for them. Even to the point where interracial marriages aren't allowed because, well, it's not, one of the leaders said, "It's not comely." Like, "It's unpleasant to look at." That's what not comely, so that's why interracial marriages aren't allowed because your perception of beauty or what looks good is only white people. I'm sorry, I beg to differ. Like, it's [infuriating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3138s) because, and also on your part, because you had to work with these loons and then see these poor innocent children, you know…

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3145s)

…being taught this shit, right? Like that's, that's the part that's just, I'm, part of my mind is just so full right now from listening to everything that I've listened to is it's just absolutely insanity and so hypocritical of how they run their schools versus what they partake in with the Rapid Relief Team and what they give the perception and the this face that they [give](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3175s) the world are two completely different things. And I mean, you...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3178s)

It's so, it's so obvious to everybody but them. It's really, it's, and it's almost embarrassing. Like it's so obvious that you don't hold the same values to the same point where like, and it's interesting that this was sent to me about Headspace. You know, they donated food boxes to this amazing organization called Headspace. And so a couple has reached out to Headspace and said, "Do you know that you're, the organization, the Rapid Relief Team you're dealing with?" I would be interested to [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3208s) if they would donate the same food boxes to you if it was in support of the pride event that you go to. And sure enough, the Rapid Relief Team, well, they realized that the Rapid Relief Team doesn't hold the same values and I don't think they work with it anymore.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3224s)

Meanwhile, if a student accesses Headspace, they're in trouble with the breach of ICT.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3231s)

Yes. That kind of leads me into where I want to ask about, some sources sent me a couple of things that I want to ask you about. Apparently there is one counsellor employed by the whole school for the whole of Australia with a months-long waiting list. This counsellor does sessions over Zoom. So potentially, are they recorded? Like, is that not a breach of confidentiality?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3255s)

Certainly all of our classes were recorded, all of our Zoom sessions were recorded. So I imagine that they would be. I mean, that was common knowledge. That wasn't, there's no, there's no secrecy about that. I'm not aware of any counsellor. That certainly wasn't something that was...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3276s)

Well, I don't think they would advertise it. So I'm thinking it's taken from the smart sheet or whatever it is, the register, like any interest needed in that area. Because then they've gone on to say all referrals to this counsellor or other professionals need to be approved by the chain of command up to the national level of Brethren. So essentially removing any confidentiality. So you've just got somebody who's high up in the Brethren, either because of wealth or family connections, having a say on your child's mental health [or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3307s) professional that they can speak to.

And they've also said that on top of that, all professionals, so I think psychologists, speech pathologists, all need to be vetted by the board and reports have to be sent to the school. They want to list names of any professionals that the students are seeing outside of the school. And like I said earlier, staff aren't allowed to suggest any support services such as Headspace to kids in crisis or offer support to parents.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3335s)

Definitely, that wouldn't be something that you would do. Oh, but it's so disturbing. It's so disturbing.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3344s)

I'm really like, that's the hard part. That's the hard part with all of this is that you're not talking about adults though, right?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3350s)

We're talking about children.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3352s)

That's what I mean. Like my heart, I'm going to like, I'm going to need therapy after this podcast. It's all I'm going to know is I'm going to have to go to therapy for myself because my heart is just, this is, these, this is kids. These are absolute kids that are being so brainwashed and manipulated and just, could you imagine their push pull of their brain in this where they see RRT being sponsored by Headspace sitting there, yet the same person who probably [reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3382s) out to this mental helpline got into trouble for it, understands what Headspace is. Like it's so, their poor brains, that's all I can think of is their poor brains that are so twisted. 

These schools, they need to be shut down. Like I'm sitting here quiet trying to just absorb this all and I want to be realistic and I want to be fair in what I'm saying, but ultimately these schools should not be running. They just should not be running. These kids should be in normal public schools, normal or...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3419s)

If they, yeah, if they're going to be run, they're run by the government. They've got to be...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3423s)

Run by the government. They have to be run by the government.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3426s)

These schools, right? They need to be able to mix with other students. They need to be able to mix with the real world because this whole idea of taking these, the, you know, setting up the schools that was set up by our beloved brother John Hales was all about, you know, protecting our kids. Where was the protection when I was sexually abused in that school? Where was the protection when I was put in a room of detention with all these boys and was sexually molested by one? Where, where was that protection for me and for all the other kids that have suffered [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3456s) these schools? Where is the protection? There's no protection. It's all a farce and it needs to come undone. It needs to, it needs to be investigated.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3467s)

I think, so I've listened to a couple of your podcasts and the stories, and there are a couple of things that are really disturbing to me. One of them is that the whole system of the community, the way the community is set up, is inherently dangerous to women. So there's a whole lot of stuff which puts them in a position where they are statistically more likely to be abused. So that's really problematic. Like no [access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3497s) to money, all of that stuff that's problematic.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3503s)

But then for the real world, they really cripple you for getting out and escaping, in particular women. That's so true.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3510s)

Just simply, we know that conversations where women are degraded increase the likelihood of domestic violence. So quite openly, the whole system puts women in a position of vulnerability. And then the way that the schools are set up. So if a kid is being disciplined, there's a point at which they'll have a meeting with the CA. And that might be a 15-year-old girl in the company of a 35-year-old man who is not a teacher, who doesn't have a duty of care like a teacher does. And they'll have a police check clearance?

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3562s)

Yeah, I imagine. I mean, they'd have to have working with children, but that's, you know, a fairly, I don't think they would have back in my day because some of those, those...

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3569s)

Well, it wouldn't happen in another school. So in another school, there wouldn't be that one-on-one kind of meeting in a closed room. Just the system is in place so that it avoids that, because we know that the likelihood of child sexual abuse is increased with access. So schools to protect themselves, to protect children, to protect teachers, set up systems where that doesn't happen. So in this instance, that happens. And then, [um,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3599s) like you guys have discussed, where kids are removed from their families.

We had a situation where out of nowhere, the discipline policy or the behavioral policy, so the policy that outlined what would happen. So you know, you get a warning, you get three warnings, and then you get a detention, whatever it is. At another school, that might be the case. These posters were put up around the school and the last point was that the child would be sent to another school. Now that means going to live somewhere else, away from your parents.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3643s)

Because we know in the Brethren that the communities already are quite stretched to get to one school and make it central. Like so for you to go to another school means you're a whole probably state or another locality away. Not even locality because that's within your interchange.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3659s)

So like as a teacher, that's horrifying. As a parent, it's horrifying. There's no way that I would send my kids even, I can't imagine even to family as discipline, that that would be something that I would see is acceptable. So these kids are removed from their homes, they can't access help outside of the, like it's all, it all sets itself up.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3690s)

It's illegal fostering, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3691s)

Yeah, I was going to say it leads into that, that topic we've covered before, the illegal fostering. And the thing is though, Jane, you've got to realize you wouldn't also let a church say to you, "You can't speak to your kid because he left the church." So these people are so indoctrinated that it's nothing to them. Like my cousins who were taken away from their parents and shifted somewhere else because they weren't deemed fit to look after them, which is not their business, anybody's business within the church leadership to make that point of call. Yeah, it's psychologically years of brainwashing to be able for them to look over that dot point and go, "Well, that's just, yeah, of course, why wouldn't we send our kids somewhere else?"

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3733s)

Yeah, so I just remember that poster going up and thinking, "Why isn't anyone else disturbed by this? This is, you know, it's horrifying." But people kind of like, "Oh, this system's not my business."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3750s)

We know, we know with, just from other people who have done podcasts and have told their story of their sexual abuse as a child, and we know that they do not keep these predators. I mean, they still go to these schools, right? I just think that there needs to be, if these schools are to be saved, there needs to be a very thorough investigation of knowing who the church is themselves. Let's get into the business side of things and then the school side of things. It has to be looked at all together. It can't just be looked at just the school because there's ways to hide what they're doing, there's ways to get around what they're doing, which is hence what's still happening, right?

It just, it breaks my heart that these kids, generation after generations, are being [completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3812s) raped of their thinking, raped of their way of processing their environment, way of, they're raped of how to be able to even, and I use the word rape, I'm using that word because that is what is happening. These kids have no way to get the help that they need. And yet if the teachers come in to do it, it's still not happening, right? This is a count after a count after a count that we're hearing. And I really implore the [teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3845s) to reach out to us to do these podcasts the way that we're doing them. I don't care if it's the same story that we tell 20 different times from 20 different teachers.

It's the repetitiveness of it that needs to be told so that we can get this stories across. These are my nieces and nephews. These are the people that, family that I don't even have anything to do with, that I will fight my ass off in order to know that at some point in time, [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3875s) generation is saved from the actual manipulation that their minds and souls go through inside these school systems.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3883s)

Yeah, it's, it's crazy to me. And that's, you know, I said before, I found it really difficult that there was, it seemed obvious to me that there should be a really clear separation. So I didn't understand why the leaders weren't able to say, "No, this can't be like that because, and this is the law, you know, this is how schools have to run." And my experience is that Brethren parents are no different to any other parents. They [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3913s) their kids and they want the best for them, essentially. A lot of the stuff that goes on is naivety. You know, they don't, like, it's like the church and then also the school are, it's like institutional grooming. Everyone is being groomed.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3936s)

And this is what I mean. Like if they went to normal schools, they wouldn't be brainwashed. They wouldn't have a cult because they wouldn't have the following.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3943s)

Say at a state school in Australia, if a child is questioning their gender, the school can actually support that child to pursue whatever they want to do without the permission of parents. So I've taught kids that are identifying as male or female that have changed their name, whose parents aren't supporting them. But because of the way the law is and the protection of children, schools support them in that. Now, whether you agree with [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3973s) or not is irrelevant. It is student-centered. It's about protecting that child, it's about supporting that child. You know, here you have on one hand that going on elsewhere, and then we've got this institution that, I mean, it's really difficult. It's, yeah.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3996s)

Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=3997s)

Yeah, I want to share an experience. So in my class, I recently connected with a teacher and she, like there was a kid in my class that was, she was a top scoring student at HSC English Standard in 2009\. And we didn't know, nobody knew that, except later on I find out that they were told they weren't allowed to let, she wasn't allowed to accept her award in person. So she wasn't allowed to get this acknowledgement essentially. And I think, I do wonder, is it because she was female? Is it because she was so brilliant that she could [have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4040s) been in anything really in the real world? Whether that discrimination happened because, you know, out of protection for the students that we don't want them to end up, you know, with thoughts of, well, critical thinking, right, that would have led to, and in turn questioning the environment you're in.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4059s)

I feel like I remember we had one year, a year where the dux of the school was a female and there was kind of a suggestion that that might make it difficult for her to find a husband because it would be, she was too opinionated or...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4076s)

Yeah, and that is a known thing. Like a contentious woman, they don't want, that's what they would call it, you know, a woman with brains.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4083s)

Yeah, I mean, that stuff, I remember, you know, that's really disturbing being female. I have kids of my own. This idea that they're only good for having babies and you know, like families are amazing and that that stuff is incredible, but...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4106s)

It should be, if you ask me, they're overrated.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4112s)

Yeah. I mean, that in itself is devastating that because there's no happy solution to all of that. You know, while obviously you are better off, there's still that pain associated with having...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4130s)

Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And it's every day, you know, it's something you live with. It's not something you, yeah. I do, I know we're digressing, but I do have people say to me, "Oh, you know, you've been out... Oh my gosh, it's tomorrow. Wow."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4146s)

So I mean, this isn't going to air right away, but yes. So well, I'm happy...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4152s)

For it too. In three days time, I celebrate my, no, I left in 2016\. So what's that? Eighth year of living. But I do say people say this all the time, "How have you been able to get over it?" Like, I don't. I just accept that it's a part of me I carry with me. And if I need to mourn it by expressing tears or by being alone, I do. I honor it and I'm comfortable with it. Like I think you become comfortable with it. It's not, you, there is no getting over it.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4178s)

Not when we have families in there. There is no getting over it. You learn how to walk with it and you learn how to use the emotions as fuel to make change, right? You take your pain and give it purpose. That's what I do every single day. There is days when the pain is debilitating, but you always make yourself get up and you turn that pain into purpose. It's not about getting over it. We're not ever going to get over it. It's a part of us. You learn how to walk with it. You just [let](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4208s) it give it wings, give it a voice, give it the crayons to color with, right? Give it some...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4216s)

And whilst it doesn't, yeah, and whilst it doesn't consume you, and like at times me and Cheryl were like, "Oh, well, we should take a step back," or, "Yeah, I mean, you could actually play some sport or..."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4226s)

We definitely have imbalance with it when it gets busy, right? When it gets busy.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4232s)

Humans, we're all in balance and imperfect. Yeah, who cares? A couple of last questions I want to run by, vital points. I've had a source reach out and say that there's been a massive, which I said suggested a 70% staff turnover in the last year. There's been a massive amount of people in leadership positions culled over the last two years, which, you know, from an inside perspective, we knew that anyway. That that's, that happens all the time. So that's validation. Principals, heads, teachers, national and state teachers of education, they've [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4262s) been announced with the same tendered resignation effective immediately message.

None of them have been heard from since, which I, you know, previously mentioned, suggests a NDA and a huge payout. And then staff last year were given new contracts and coerced into signing them. These included conditions around staff not posting anything on social media which is in opposition to Brethren values, which, can I add, the army don't even do that. Like the, your government positions [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4293s) tell you how you can, like you can live your life on social media, right? And it can't be in opposition to, like the army can't even do that. Yet the Brethren do, which I think that needs to be looked into. And then, yeah, so just your thoughts on that.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4310s)

Look, it's all so secretive and when people leave, they don't like, you know, "Oh, we don't want to announce it." You know, you often would hear a rumor and then it would come out and it's served up in a certain way. There's lots of damage control. It, I mean, that those things are red flags in themselves. It's like there's no transparency. There are, I mean, as a teacher, you have a responsibility to uphold certain values. So teachers can lose registration over bringing the profession into disrepute. So in that sense, and then most workplaces have non-disclosures. In that sense, that [seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4372s) to me fairly generic, but it's quite specific.

And so they kind of cover themselves. It's like when I first, well, no, not when I first started, I think they probably still do it now. One of the ways they support their own businesses is, you know, Brethren businesses that do uniforms, they'll give you an allowance to buy a uniform. But it's quite controlled. Like I remember looking at it and thinking, "There's no way I'm going to wear any of that stuff." And I thought what I wanted to was buy, they had men's woolen jumpers, but I couldn't actually purchase men's clothing because I was female. So that's kind of funny. But that was their way of making people wear skirts, making women wear skirts. So they could kind of cover themselves by making it uniform. If it's uniform, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4424s) you can, you know, you can request that people, wow. So they do this kind of controlling stuff. I mean, I think actually now that's probably not even possible. I think, you know, if you uniform, you have to have a pants option for women as well. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4440s)

But that type of maneuvering and counter moves and, you know, chess with Bobby Fischer style is very, is very a practice they put into place with clever accounting and, and you know, other facets of the cult. And we know they're so good at that.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4458s)

Yeah, and then it all feeds itself. It's like, you know, speaking of Rapid Relief, there's no charity that is branded in the way that it is with all the paraphernalia, which is all supplied by Brethren businesses. So it's like, you know, the front is that they're doing this amazing thing and, and quite possibly, you know, serving sausages to firefighter is amazing. But there's a lot of money that goes into the branding. So how much of [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4488s) is actually just getting, how much of this charity is just getting fed back into Brethren businesses? And then I, I don't know whether this is true, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were employing the young people. So it's a way to occupy young people. Yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4504s)

Oh, definitely. And you're mandatory volunteering. Like if I didn't go, my dad would be like at a bushfire event. He would be down my throat, "You are going and you're wearing that shirt. You're wearing that hat." Like it's, yeah. But the irony, like in the same way that it's all like an ecosystem, like you go to UBT, for example, and you look at Google reviews and they've got like 40 reviews, but just running through them, I'm like, "These are all just random Brethren's reviewing." Yeah, like I mean, they've been there in their life.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4535s)

So we would occasionally have PDS, a professional development, that would be at teacher academy, academy in Sydney in the precinct. And you know, speaking about this system which is inherently dangerous to women, and you turn up there, all the men are 35 and over, and all the women that are working there are 18, 19\. These very young girls serving, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4566s) know, drinks and whatever. I remember going there and feeling really uncomfortable about this situation that clearly, you know, just as a female, as a young woman, I would have been uncomfortable in that situation. It would have seemed to me inherently problematic.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4584s)

Yeah. And on the same note, I remember hearing a story recently where a teacher told me that they were put in a really difficult position where, you know, two girls were discussing their work experience that they had to do in year 11, 12, year 12\. They had work experience at a Brethren, high up Brethren business, part of the royal family. And yeah, essentially working at this business, one [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4614s) the Brethren men came into the lunchroom behind them and did some things that are very disturbing, like licking her neck and things like that, that are very, sniffing her hair and just very predatory, grooming style behaviors that should, concerns should have been raised. And it was like, "Well, how do I do this when the person I'm speaking to is directly involved?"

[And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4645s) this is the problem and I guess the success of keeping the cult within itself and the schools, because they do, they keep it like this, setting up the same, these systems in place so that nothing can get out. Nothing, nobody does want to report because at the end of the day, it's going to cause more damage than to them and the student and then it will affect, in a good way.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4666s)

I'm certain, and Cheryl, maybe you can confirm this, but in that situation, if a woman was to say something, then it would be kind of put back on her. Yeah, somehow she had, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4677s)

"Why were you showing off your neck?"

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4679s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4680s)

"Why did you use good shampoo for your hair? You know, you're just tempting men."

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4686s)

Yeah, never in the bounds problem.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4690s)

Yeah, yeah. I think one of the things, the end of the year, there is a dinner that they have. It's usually set up by the second to last year of school for the school leavers. And at the school that I was at, the kids would set up in a room, they would black out all of the windows, there'd be no teachers in there. So it was notoriously a time when they'd get really drunk. Now there's no scenario in any school situation where teachers aren't supervising. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4721s) you know, that's not appropriate. But these, they would have this luncheon and then towards the end, there was kind of this compromise where they'd have Brethren supervisors. That's still problematic because they're not teachers, it's a school environment.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4737s)

And they're not cleared. Like none of these, I've never heard of a Brethren, like any of the Brethren teachers that or supervisors that I knew getting any sort of clearance.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4746s)

Yeah, I mean, I just can't, I can't, they'd have to have...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4751s)

Probably now, but I, yeah.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4753s)

Yeah, schools don't have, people don't come on to school campuses without, like for instance, my husband suggested that I could perhaps have my car serviced at school and like, "We can't, you can't do that because you couldn't have someone coming onto school campus to do it." Even though it's the car park and it's not near kids, it, you know, can't work. This, I just, I don't see, but it wouldn't at the same time, it wouldn't really surprise [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4783s) because they find ways around these things. Like, you know, you only get caught if it's revealed or something goes wrong.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4792s)

Yeah, 100%. No, I just know because, like, my mum would be at school or doing canteen or whatever. She had never sat down and did any clearance or any checks. It was never in place. And same with the older men that used to teach Bible studies. There was absolutely not any clearance. Like, there's just not. There wouldn't have been. But, you know, I don't even think they do that anymore. So who knows, like you say, they do evolve to protect their name, the tiny little increments that they implement.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4822s)

So to wrap this up, Jane, what would you want to say to OneSchool Global to make changes that they need to make? Like if you were to summarize everything that you've come across, what would you say to them if you were able to have a one-to-one face conversation with them and they were actually going to listen to you?

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4845s)

I feel like that's such a difficult question to answer. I mean, look, I think I left at the point where I felt like it was hopeless because there was a period of time where I believed that there was a real effort to do things the right way. But the point at which I left was when I came to the conclusion that that wasn't true.

I think that most importantly, there shouldn't be any grey area around child safety. I don't think that that can be any compromise and religious beliefs, moral beliefs can't allow a compromise in that area. So I guess that it would be to put in place the checks and balances and policies that stop that from happening, to [create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4904s) a separation from the church and its beliefs, because the two things can't cross over successfully at the moment.Does that make sense?

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4915s)

Yeah, absolutely, and I get it. I get it. And I mean, I don't know. I honestly don't know if any of this is possible, right? Like, I don't think it's just from all the stories that lie on our lap that I don't know if it's possible to save these schools, because the Brethren, if they don't, if they don't change their whole church system, if that doesn't get changed, the school is not going to be changed. They both go hand in hand. And unless the government steps up, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4945s) got to be, there needs to be more policies, there needs to be more government involved inside this, there needs to be more rules besides just checking boxes and handing that into the government.

Things need to be monitored. There needs to be different, a whole different system needs to be brought in for this. That's my opinion. It's sad. It's sad that generations are being completely lost over this. And I say that very firmly that they get lost over this because [children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4978s) need to process emotions, children need to learn how to deal with their mind, children need to understand what it is like to have diversity in their conversations and what they're being taught. And they don't get that within OneSchool Global.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=4993s)

One of the things when I was there, there's this distinct lack of respect for tests and so they're not good at following rules. Kids will sort of break the rules and I used to always wonder how they would go about doing their final year exams when they had this, like they would happily cheat. I mean, I think they thought that made them clever. And then since leaving, there's a couple of things that have come to light. Firstly, the person who [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5023s) employed now, I thought they were employed by the curriculum body that oversees the final year testing, they're actually employed by the school.

So that person, the person that did it for many years, also their family owned a car dealership. And so the Brethren would buy their cars from this family's car dealership. And this person was adjudicating, [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5053s) the person representing our curriculum body, making sure that they did their final year exams following rules. So that's inherently kind of questionable. But then also, you know, there are certain subjects that the Brethren hold more importantly. So they pride themselves on being the top of the nation for business studies. There was an incident where a person representing the curriculum body was called into question in that there was a complaint made that the final year exam was biased towards Brethren students. And then it was discovered that this person who was heading the curriculum body for that subject was also employed by Brethren.

And so that conflict of interest, no longer was in charge of creating the exam, although I think they are also still. So there's this, and then there's also kind of at the time that I was there, it was apparent that with final year studies, there's all these rules and regulations, but a lot of the assessment comes down to individual teachers. And so it was very clear that that, and you know, to be fair, [there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5138s) pressure on a lot of schools to perform well and so there is kind of a gray area, but definitely things were not done ethically. Yeah, yeah. So there's this kind of cheating that would go...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5154s)

Well, in a more recent period of events, and I think this teacher is going to come on and share her story as well, but so I won't take it all from her, but there was an interesting thing in the same way with ChatGPT, like using AI to, it was very obvious that these students were using AI to get their exams and for their major assessments done. And when that was brought to the attention of the Brethren that were around the school, it was like, "We don't really care, like as long as they get good results."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5191s)

I remember a situation similar where the kids, a question was, because when you assess for final year, you moderate with other assessors, so you compare to other groups. Yeah. There was a situation where nearly 80% of the students were going to fail an assessment because they hadn't done it correctly and that was just swept under the carpet. I think we might have got our best results that year. So clearly they didn't get the penalty [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5221s) they were supposed to get. That stuff, I mean, the truth is if you don't have a respect for education...

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5228s)

See, this is what I mean by I don't think OneSchool Global is saveable. It's the same reason why I think...

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5234s)

Not at all.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5235s)

It's this is why, this is just, it just confirms what my gut feeling is, is that yeah.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5241s)

I had a teacher just recently who just left, right, a one of the, one of the OneSchool Global schools, say to me that from her years of teaching there, the kids have inherently become like less intelligent. Like it's, it's like there is a, an effect of the placebo or the effect of being remaining so insular within a community, so restricted, so kept, it kept hidden from rich English texts and and other forms of media that you can access. That yeah, because I was having this conversation saying, you know, like we were the brightest. Like, "Oh no, you have no idea now." Like what the, they aren't getting what you kids were getting back in the day. They aren't that, [they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5288s) not, they're not, they're inherently becoming less and less engaged.

Yeah, and there is, there's scientific evidence to back that up. There was a, I think a Harvard study done where they took parts or studied parts of the brain of people that were in a cult-like community versus the real world where you have the flexibility to use all faculties and exploring and natural exploration. And it was these, the use of the brain became less and less. And I guess that kind of lines up with a lot of like, how can I get people saying to me, "How can they be so stupid? How can they be like just so blinded by it?" I'm like, "Well..."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5329s)

It's inherently, you just need to think things outside of the doctrine. So, you know, I imagine, and I'm not there, but I imagine there's a great deal of energy put into making yourself not think things.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5347s)

A hundred percent. You were taught, "We do the thinking, you do the doing."

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5351s)

Yeah. In reference to the question before, what would you say to them? I think that, you know, what I would say to someone else is that I wish I hadn't worked there. Oh, that's a powerful statement. It has taken me a long time and a lot of talking about it and a lot of, I mean, you know, it's not nice to feel like you have to forgive yourself for [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5381s) situation, but I went into the school inherently suspicious and I feel like I left a little bit damaged still.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5396s)

It's so sad to hear.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5399s)

And it just breaks my heart. It break, it just like, it makes me, part of me still feels ashamed that this church is still alive because of the pain that people that were never born into it experience and I'm out of it. Like, I want to just reach through the screen right now and hug you because you should have never went through what you went through. I just, I don't know what we can do. I don't know what we can do to make the changes that we need to.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5428s)

I don't think we can. And that's why we are using our voices to share this. And Jane, thank you so much. And I think I want to say this and I say this to every single teacher I come across as a former kid there, you know? And I think I'd be speaking on most of the kids that have left today because they, they resound with the same message. Thank you. You were in the darkest periods of our lives, the only light, the only, the only thing that stopped us from unaliving ourselves essentially. Yeah, it was [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5458s) was the teachers. It wasn't, I was looking forward to going to English the next day. It was no, because that certain teacher was going to be teaching me at least one or two periods. That two periods was a great day, you know? And you might have hated, I hated maths, but I loved the teacher and that's why I chose science. Like it's very, yeah, I just want to say thank you. It was, it was it huge, a huge impact that you, I know you were so restricted and I know you held back so much, but you're a beacon of light for us kids. So thank you.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5491s)

Thank you. Yeah, thank you both for being on here today. We'll end on that note. I think we, and like Ben, I'm just saying I just appreciate every teacher that is still in there. Every teacher that has messaged us, messaged Ben, we have so many teachers reaching out right now. Please know that if you need to find out how to report what you've witnessed, email us at [info.getalifeatproton.me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5521s) Reach out to Ben at ExCultBoy on his social media platforms.

Together we can make changes. I do believe that. It's just hard to know where to start. And I think that we just need to go back to the core of why we started these podcasts and it was about survivors coming on. And that's not just survivors from those that were born and raised inside there. It's also survivors that have worked with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church members. It's also survivors that have taught the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church children. We're all survivors. And I think when we come together like this, there's power in [numbers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5559s) There's power in using our voices.

So I really, really implore the teachers to reach out, be brave enough to come on and do it the same way that Jane has done it. We've had another one that's come on before. We know that there are some that are wanting to come on. I would take 50 of you and do you all separately because the repetition needs to be heard in there. I had a recent leaver tell me that during his, during the struggles that they went through in leaving, [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5589s) went through their head was the repetitiveness of the stories that they listened to. So it doesn't matter alone.

### [**Ben Woodbury**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5598s)

Right, you feel less alone. And in doing that, there's strength in numbers. And I know there's a huge fear about the litigation because the Brethren do tend to come after people that speak up. What's happening now, the revolution that is happening now, yes, it's different. The activism that is happening now is unprecedented. It's never happened before. And I firmly believe that there will be a huge, like the ATO are investigating them, there will be a huge outcome from this. And be on the right side of history as we tackle [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5628s) is a toxic community that has so many victims within it that need saving.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5635s)

That have very good people inside there. Yeah. And it's those, to me, it's always been about my nieces and nephews. It's always been about my nieces and nephews. It's the children. It's the children for me.

### [**OSG Teacher**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5648s)

Your religion and your faith is being used against you. That's devastating.

### [**Cheryl Bawtinheimer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N3qr1JqpNw&t=5653s)

Yeah. Yeah. So thank you both. Until next time, everyone. Much love to you all. Thank you.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations

Throughout this transcript, references are made to a range of organizations, businesses, and charities affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). The following is a summary of key entities commonly referenced in discussions about the PBCC's structure and influence:

*   **OneSchool Global (OSG)** – A global network of private schools established and operated by the PBCC, with campuses in over 20 countries.
*   **Universal Business Team (UBT)** – The PBCC's international business support and consulting arm, providing procurement, training, IT, and group services for PBCC businesses and households.
*   **Campus&Co** – A retail chain managed by PBCC volunteers, to keep membership spending within the PBCC ecosystem.
*   **The Grace Trust** – The central UK charitable trust of the PBCC, used to receive tax-exempt donations from members and their businesses.
*   **Rapid Relief Team (RRT)** – The PBCC's emergency and disaster relief organization, generally recognised as a corporate sanitizing and PR initiative.
*   **Gospel Hall Trusts**  – Legal entities that own and maintain PBCC meeting halls and church properties across various regions.
*   **Bible & Gospel Trust** – The official publisher and distributor of PBCC-approved religious literature and scriptures.
