## Summary

What happens when you are in the PBCC and fall in love with an outsider?
Sarah describes what happened to her and how she and her family were so harshly dealt with just because they asked if someone could join the brethren to be with her.
Sarah tells us of the treatment her father received at the hands of the brethren and how this contributed to his nervous breakdown. She speaks emotionally about how she was denied the chance to pay her respects to her father after he passed away.
Sarah’s story will resonate with many ex brethren as we all have lived experience of their behavior. But others who haven’t experienced such behavior may be shocked at the harm and suffering caused just because an outsider wanted to join this church. It gives weight to the conclusion that outsiders are not welcome in the brethren.
The brethren claim to be a ‘Mainstream Christian Church’. But what other mainstream church behave like this?

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=0s)

What is your freedom worth to you?

Each of our guests had a lightbulb moment. They longed to live rather than merely exist. They smashed through their fears and programmed minds, trusting themselves, their faith and their survival instincts, leaving the guilt, fear, oppression and drudgery of their past for a brighter future. They took a brave and courageous step into freedom.

This is their story of how they got a life. Welcome to Get A Life podcast, Ex-Cult Conversations. You matter and so does your story.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=58s)

Good evening everybody, welcome to the Get A Life podcast here in the UK. I'm joined by my friends Ross and Gilli and our special guest tonight is Sarah Rowlands, who has quite a story to tell of how she left the Brethren some years ago. So Sarah, do you just want to start right at the beginning?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DMSrrj7-u30o%26t%3D79s)

Yeah. Thank you for having me. It's kind of weird being on Zoom, but lovely to see you all. I mean, Anne, I haven't seen you for years. Yeah, never met you yet, John. But yeah, it's lovely to see everybody. So thank you for having me.

I was local in Reading in the UK and I basically was shut up for introducing my ex-husband to the Brethren. I was obviously born in the Brethren, mid-70s, one of seven children. We were local in Reading in the UK.

I knew from a very young age, the age of five, that something was awry with being in the Brethren because I was invited to a school party and I had to tell my friend that I couldn't go because I was in the Brethren. I didn't say at this point that it was because I love Jesus, that came later on at school. Cringe. But yes, I just said, you know, "I can't attend because I'm in a different religion," was what I used to say when I was really young. So I knew something was wrong then.

Growing up, we had a massive house garden, used to play in the garden a lot. Very occasionally, we would be able to play with another Brethren family across the street, down the road a bit. But generally, it was in the garden. We had our knuckles wrapped if we went around the block on somebody's bike. I had an absolute thing about BMX bikes when I was nine or 10\. And I can remember getting my knuckles [wrapped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=200s) because I went on my mate's around the block, and it was the best thing ever.

I was also really, really naughty and drove over a bowling green on one. I remember getting chased by the park man for that. But yeah, the little silly things like that were probably the most that we did in terms of activities outside of school. Obviously, we weren't allowed to go to the beach or community events, parties, carnivals.

I remember as a child growing up, every summer we heard the carnival and could hear the music and how I longed to see what it was like but weren't allowed to go. There was a, I don't know if you've heard of the Red Devils, the parachute team. They always used to jump at the carnival and we used to get so excited because they would chuck the streamers out and they'd land on the top of the house. Dad would get the ladder out, we'd go up on the house [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=268s) try and see how much we could see of the parachutes. It was the most silly little things that were so exciting because life was far from normal.

So yeah, growing up in the Brethren was difficult. It was also difficult because I have always been a big girl and they are very fattest in there and don't like it unless you're slim or fit the mold. So yeah, I was bullied at school, not just for being a Bible-basher but being a fat Bible-basher, which was hard going. But I was also bullied by other Brethren members quite badly because I was a chunky monkey. The final straw was when I had a nice expletive [keyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=327s) into my car door. That was in 1997\. And I know who did that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=341s)

A Brethren member?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=342s)

It was, yeah. And the silly thing was that my sister and I had gone to Germany to do some babysitting where, at that point, Bruce Hales was attending a meeting before he was prominent. Everybody was getting very psyched up about the fact that Bruce Hales was going to be there, and I was actually really chuffed I was over in the corner of the car park looking after the kids because I couldn't be bothered. I didn't have any interest. To me, he was a nobody. I just love kids and being with the kids was what I was happy doing, and it also gave me an excuse to be out of the way.

But anyway, I said to my parents, "I've got [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=384s) really horrible hunch that I'm going to come back home after being away and my car is going to be damaged," and that's exactly what happened. So yeah, and it wasn't just from young people as well, they were grown married men that were absolutely vile. You know, even men over 50 were horrible. They always said that I would never get married because I was too fat. All manner of things. I laugh at it now, but at the time it was horrible and it was painful.

And it's so hypocritical, isn't it? Because all the middle-aged and older men are so fat themselves anyway. Yeah, they do have bellies on them, bless them, some of them. But yes, there is the hypocrisy side of things, but also I wasn't liked really because I spoke out about things that weren't right. I suppose I was seen as not sisterly and gobby.

But I'll come back to that in a minute. Just going back to the childhood, childhood was hard. You couldn't do the normal things that so many families take for granted, the things that I've been able to give my own children. That gives me the biggest buzz in the world, which is something that's so insignificant to anyone else who does that naturally without thinking. You know, just the simple things of being able to, if my child wants to go go-karting, yeah you can go. I don't have to think about it. If they want to go and enjoy that, then they can go and enjoy it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=494s)

If they want to go to the carnival, they can go.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=497s)

Exactly, yeah. Like my eldest son, he went away on holiday last week, his first holiday abroad with his girlfriend and their friend group. We weren't allowed holidays. It was foreign, wasn't it? You know, even days to the beach. I know it seems to vary from locality to locality about what rules were in place and who was at the helm.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=526s)

Yeah, it did. And I mean, I obviously left a long time ago, but what I remember about things like going to the beach, we used to go as a family and then we'd end up going and there'd be a whole party of Brethren that went to the beach. We'd have a really good time and that's when it got clamped down on. So it kind of yo-yoed depending on how disobedient...

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=547s)

Yeah. And also even in the same locality, there would be families that would go and families that wouldn't. We had that issue very much in Reading. There was quite a divide with the same families that actually created quite horrible animosity between households. But yeah, so growing up was hard, school was tough.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=579s)

But presumably you were of an age where you went to normal school all the way through?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=587s)

I did. No, thank God.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=588s)

Yeah, so you went to mainstream comprehensive school.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=592s)

Yeah, the bullying continued, not just from nasty kids but other peebs as well. I mean, there were times I had to be escorted out of school because I was going to get beaten up. I remember I lost my shit once and fought back, and I gave this lad a black eye with a metal pencil case that I had in my bag. I'd given him such a swipe, I can remember his name, Paul. I'd given him this major black eye and my dad took me, made me go to school and apologise because all he kept saying was, "You need to turn the other cheek."

Yeah, it was constantly turn the other cheek. But the bullying thing happened every single meeting, every night. And my mum used to say to me, "Oh, I always admire the fact that you still show people the same care, despite the way that you're treated." And they knew it was going on. Absolutely knew it was going on. I mean, occasionally my parents, I can remember more than one occasion, they would argue sat in the car in the car park because mum would say, "Well, there's only so much somebody can take," and dad would be on the other hand be saying, "You know, turn the other cheek."

Yeah, if you don't mind me interjecting, turning the other cheek when you're being bullied is about the worst thing you can do anyway. Yeah. Because it makes them do it all the more. Yeah. And of course, I became, I mean my nickname in the Brethren was Chubbs or Chubbys. I was known as Chubbs or Chubbys and at the time I didn't really sort of think too much about it. But looking back, it's just not necessary or kind.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=726s)

It's wrong. It's as simple as that, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=729s)

Yeah. And the one thing I had to learn very quickly as well after leaving the peeps was that just because you're used to something doesn't make it right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=739s)

No. And it also makes me wonder, with what you say about your parents, whether maybe particularly your mum had an inner conflict going on. Because she would have seen her little girl being upset, and I don't care how old you are, you are still her little girl, aren't you? But also, they're in this situation whereby you can't take issue with other Brethren families over things like this, can you? You said the same in your podcast, Gilly, the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=769s) thing. You can't, you just have to accept it. But I bet it probably gave your mum an internal conflict. Do you think she...

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=776s)

Oh, she was. There were times that I've seen her in tears about it, yeah, as a child. And it's funny because the other day I was trying to think back to how young I was when I used to see her drinking in bed after the meeting, and that goes back to quite a young age, like primary school.

Oh, I've just had a brain fart. I'm really sorry. I have these mental blocks where my mind literally wipes and I don't know what I'm talking about. Sorry, I'll come back in a minute.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=812s)

That's okay. We've gone as far as how you were being treated by the Brethren and the bullying that went on through your growing up years.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=817s)

Yeah. So I hated my life in the Brethren. I hated it because it was miserable. I never felt that I fitted in. I kept wanting to leave but didn't know how to leave. I can remember being in senior school and thinking, "Well, I could go and stay with so-and-so." And I had serious conversations with non-Brethren school classmates that would say, "Well, you could come and stay with us. I could talk to my parents about it." And having this glimmer of hope and thinking, "Oh, you know, maybe I can get out."

And I remember July '89, my parents did the famous Australia-New Zealand trip. And my sister Rachel, you'll know Rachel, Anne, she came and stayed with us and I can remember my mum saying, "I'll keep an eye on her because I don't want her going." But I can remember we were playing badminton in the garden and passing some reference to the fact that I wasn't going to be here much longer anyway, because I'd had enough. But I was constantly watched. There wasn't anything that I could do without supervision other than use the bathroom, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=896s)

Yeah. So at this stage when your sister came to stay with you and your parents went away, how old would you have been? 13? Okay, so she came effectively to look after you.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=906s)

Yeah, they didn't have children at the time. They'd been married for three, four years. But yeah, it was just, yeah, growing up was horrible. I don't feel that I've had a childhood, as I think a lot of ex-Brethren members could relate to that. But it is what it is. You've got to embrace the now, haven't you? And move on. Yes, it leaves its mark, but I've also found that it'll be 25 years this November I was kicked out, and my whole journey of grief has changed hugely. I'll touch on that a bit later on.

But yes, it's something that I do want to share. So just going back to teenage years, early on when my sister Rachel got married, we had to seek permission for her then husband-to-be to come over from Ireland a day before, because obviously geographical distance and all that sort of thing. So dad asked permission from the Brethren and got given the go-ahead. They got married and then after the wedding, we were shut up. All because dad allegedly didn't ask for permission for him to come over early.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1000s)

Wow.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1001s)

Yeah, well, they confessed at the review that dad had, and of course, dad was dead at this point. So it pissed me off that he never got this apology, if you want to call it that. But they admitted at the review that it was just a personal grudge. But we were shut up. So Rachel had just got married. The eldest three were moved out, who were 19, 17 and 16\. And my two sisters and I stayed at home.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1036s)

All because your brother-in-law had come to stay the day before his wedding?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1040s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1041s)

Wow.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1043s)

And that was March '85 till it was just before my eldest brother got married in July '86. So it wasn't even just a few weeks. And that time, I vividly remember being absolutely scared that I was never going to see my family again. We used to make the beds fresh religiously every week in the hopes that we would be back with the Brethren. We used to sit by the understairs, like thinking, "Oh, is somebody going to come and knock on the door to see us? Are the priests going to come and see us? Is the phone going to ring? Are we going to be [left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1081s) behind at the rapture?" The whole rapture thing.

And how did they come to see you? Oh, we were, there was a time, it was three or four months, we didn't see anybody.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1092s)

So Sarah, for the benefit, I know the phrase "shut up" has been used a lot on the podcast, but for the benefit of anyone listening who doesn't know what it means, we all know, perhaps explain the implications of being shut up on your sisters and your parents. What did that mean for you as a family? What did that restrict you from?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1115s)

So it literally meant that, I mean, obviously you've got to bear in mind that Brethren life is going to a Brethren business and then in the evening you go to Brethren church. Well, if you're excommunicated or shut up, you're not allowed to have anything to do with any other Brethren or attend church. So everything that you knew as your life was gone. You know, even I can remember going to primary school, they wouldn't even speak to me in the playground. It was horrible. You felt like a leper.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1153s)

And you have no, I mean, when you're growing up in the Brethren, for what it is, the meetings are your social life, aren't they?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1161s)

Yeah, absolutely. Completely ripped from away from you. Yeah, it was just literally rug pulled from beneath your feet. It was gone. That was it. And it was such an empty void.

I guess other people might have had things that they could have carried on with, whether they're members of clubs and things like that if they're shunned from churches, but there wasn't even that in the Brethren. It literally went. I can remember the house we lived in at the time was massive. And I can remember us three girls shared a bedroom. We had bunk beds and a single bed and we had these wooden bars that you lifted off from the top bunk to keep you safe. We were messing around one day, [playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1208s) guns with these wooden bars.

And it was a big Victorian property with sash windows. Lovely, lovely house it was. But all of a sudden we saw my youngest brother go past. Wow. And he'd got a motorbike and we were leaning out the window going, "John, John, John\!" and I still now see him driving down the road and him looking back at us, but he couldn't stop to speak. It was, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1239s)

It was bizarre, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1241s)

It is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1241s)

Yeah. And what effect did this have on your father? Was he working for Brethren at the time or did he have his own business? How did that affect his work, the fact that he was now shut up or restricted?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1253s)

Well, he had his own business which had been going at that point about 10 years, but obviously from memory, I think my eldest brother went to work for another local brother. I can't remember what my youngest brother did because I also know that very early on he had an apprenticeship, did an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. But yeah, it was, I mean for the father of the household, it's the most humiliating thing ever, yeah, when you're shut up. The shame.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1295s)

Well, there's very much the influence, "You are the householder, you are the head of the house and you should keep your house in order," isn't there? And I think there's that very much that onus on the men in there. And if one of your children or you get shut up or one of your children is wayward, it's seen as a direct reflection on you, isn't it? Absolutely. And then you have that shame.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1321s)

Yeah, and that shame doesn't go even when you go back.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1324s)

No, oh no, it's worse.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1327s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1329s)

Yeah. So yeah, it was, I mean, it was for a very, very long time and I can remember my mum drinking quite heavily during that period of time. And the whole torture that we were going to be left behind and not be caught up with the rapture, that used to, oh, it was one of the things that I actually worked on when I had my CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) in 2020, because I was trying to work out why I would get this bout of depression at March, April time. And having worked through a lot of what went on then, tied it back to that experience.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1376s)

I'm sure. And perhaps if you don't mind, I could just explain again for viewers that don't know the concept, the Brethren concept of what the rapture was. My memory of it was very much the rapture would come at the Lord's Supper, which was held at six o'clock on a Sunday morning, which is the equivalent of Holy Communion. And it would just be those Brethren that were saved and would go, and then the rest of the world could be left to fend for themselves. So right from when we're in a cradle, that's what we were brought up with, wasn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1413s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's, you know, I'm ashamed to admit this, but I can remember as a late teen, you know, going to the supper and thinking, "Oh, so-and-so is not there again." And there was this particular mum, they had four very young children and they would rarely make it to the supper, but would be at the nine o'clock meeting. And I'm so embarrassed that I had that thought process because looking back, I'm not surprised she wasn't there. Four young children to get ready. You had to do that, didn't you, Anne?

I know we laugh at it now, but yeah, she was actually a lady that really suffered with depression. And it's not until you're older and you see things and you think, "Oh my goodness, actually how cruel the Brethren were." But you know, continually, like, yeah, I'll hold my hands up because occasionally I was like, "Oh, you know, why is she never at the supper?"

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1477s)

I mean, we were so cruel to even be lifting our children out of bed at half five in the morning and then shoving wine down their throat when they were five months old.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1490s)

Yeah, and I absolutely used to hate that. I can remember as a child having major heartburn and it was horrible. And that whole nonsense of, was it Jim Taylor that said that if as soon as a baby reaches out then they can have the wine? I remember that being said.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1510s)

Yeah, the scripture is when the Lord says "take, eat".

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1518s)

But if you're going to dangle anything in front of a baby, they're going to grab it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1521s)

A nice shiny silver cup, which is what it was, wasn't it? Or a see-through glass one that reflected.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1526s)

But often they didn't like that silver cup. Well, certainly with mine, I think they all went through a stage of pushing it away. And what I feel ashamed about is letting myself be forced to make the child drink some of that.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1546s)

And as you quite often point out, Jacky, it is actually illegal.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1549s)

It's illegal. It's actually illegal to give alcohol to an under-five-year-old in the UK. So I wonder how many of them know that. Well, they probably do now if they watch these podcasts. But it's actually illegal. Over the age of five, I mean you wouldn't, but you know, it's not an illegal act in the home, but under the age of five it is actually an illegal act to give a baby or child alcohol. And they're doing it [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1579s) a place of public religious worship every week.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1584s)

I remember a two-year-old child who had to get their stomach pumped out because they were going around the room during one of the dinner breaks, as we call them, and the adults were just letting them sip out of their glasses until they were unconscious.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1608s)

That's terrible.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1613s)

Yeah. And they wonder why there's an alcohol problem in there. Anyway, we digress, Sarah. Carry on. We've got you to about mid-teens, I think, roughly.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1629s)

Yeah, so obviously there was a thing when I was 10, that was when we were shut up and the family was separated. Yes. And the other weird thing as well is, so my mum is from Scotland and her parents were living with us at the time. And just to give you an idea of age, they would have been 75-ish. So they were living with us, we'd had an annex built on the back of the house for them, their own place.

They lived with us when we were shut up over my sister getting married. They were moved back to Scotland in their mid-70s. During that time, we moved house as a family. We very nearly bought a house with a shared drive. It was just at the point that it was, "Do you, don't you have a shared drive?" I've got a really weird thing with dates, but February 10th of '86 we moved house when we were still shut up. And we were asking ourselves questions as to how many bedrooms do we buy? What if they've got married? We won't know if they've got married. All questions like this [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1718s) were discussed with my parents about moving house.

You know, we wanted to buy a place that, should the grandparents come back to us again from Scotland, we had the facility to provide for them. So we were back just in July, just before my oldest brother got married, and he married July '86. My grandparents came back shortly after that. We had an annex built on our new house. I mean, that's a massive upheaval for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1764s)

Sorry, just to say very quickly, just to pause there. Out of interest, you were allowed back in somewhat nearly a year later. What reason did they give for suddenly allowing you and your parents and your sisters to go back?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1777s)

I don't remember the actual reason, but I do remember that when some of the priests came to visit, I can remember hearing them saying to my dad, "Oh, you need to work a bit harder at getting right." And my dad and mum didn't know what "getting right" meant. It wasn't clear to my parents what they wanted.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1804s)

And when you look at it in the context of the reason why they got shut up, they had allowed their future son-in-law to come and stay before his wedding to their daughter. In most people's eyes, what on earth is there to get right about?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1824s)

Exactly. It was, but it was all very, very personal and very obvious that it was personal. My grandparents then died four years later, four weeks apart. And do you think that was solely due to all the upheaval they had? I think it contributed to it. My grandma got Alzheimer's sadly, but she and Grampy were two peas in a pod. The [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1854s) that Granny passed away, my Grampy went blind, became diabetic, and there were three things. He went blind, became diabetic, I can't remember what the third thing was, but the doctor put on his death certificate that he died of a broken heart.

But just thinking about that, you know, that's a massive upheaval. Moving house is stressful for anybody, but let alone being that age and from one end of the country to the other. You [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=1899s), it's yeah. So that was sort of when I was about 10\. And then moving on a bit, I was, I don't know, I suppose I was quite a randy 15-year-old.

Yeah. So basically, I had a kiss and a grope with a peeb boy when I was 15, on more than one occasion. And I can remember being at senior school, and a ministry book had been delivered and I happened to read this page and it was, "Oh, we need to get right because we've been unpure," and all that bollocks.

So we used to meet on the field at school and he was saying, "Look, we don't need to confess about it because we're covered by this scripture." And I was picking out another bit of ministry going, "No, we must confess because we're not going to go to heaven," blah, blah. And we ended up sort of falling out about it. Anyway, I confessed and we then got shut up. He got shut up as well. That was a time that I found really weird as well because playing the piano or the organ was my release in the peebs and I wasn't even allowed to do that when I was shut up.

I had, literally, other than using the bathroom, I was in my bedroom for nearly four weeks. 

**Jacky Hart**

No, I was going to say, were your parents shut up? Is that the reason that you had to stay in your room? 

**Sarah Rowlands**

No, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2016s) think, obviously you're shut up as a household, aren't you? But in terms of them personally being shut up as well, I actually don't remember that bit. I can remember just being shut in the bedroom and my dinner being left on a red tray, those old entertaining trays that were either red or brown, do you remember them? Food was left on the outside and yeah, that was weird.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2050s)

Did you go to school at that time? During that time, because you were 15, were you saying? Did you go to school during the day?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2055s)

I did, yeah. And that was hard as well because nobody would speak. And do you know what really used to piss me off was that there was another peeb girl who had a non-Brethren boyfriend, and I used to see them snog and it was like, "You bitch." Yeah. "How are you allowed to do that and I'm not allowed to do that?" And he was so fit as well. Oh yeah, he was proper handsome and I was thinking, "Oh no, you're getting away with that. You've not got the urge to confess. I'm being this goody little two-shoes and yeah, in front of the spirit and all that."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2093s)

Yeah. Presumably the school at the time had no idea the circumstances you were living in during those four weeks? No, nothing at all. And I wonder what they'd have said if they had known. You'd be very concerned.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2113s)

Absolutely, yeah, I would be.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2116s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2117s)

But yeah, that was weird. It was during that time that, as much as it pains me to say it, one of the priests sexually abused me during that time. And it wasn't until 2018 when I was having my first lot of counselling that I realised what it was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2144s)

What happened? And again, to put that into context, and correct me if I'm painting a wrong picture here, Sarah, but you would have been having priestly visits during that time?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2145s)

I did, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2146s)

And those priestly visits would have been two guys, probably middle-aged, 40s, 50s maybe, and you as a 15-year-old girl on your own, talking about what you'd got up to with another lad.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2169s)

Yeah. I mean, the graphic detail that he wanted to know as to what happened, and I stupidly showed him, was just, yeah. And what he was doing when I was showing him was, yeah. I can remember it vividly because my grandparents had passed away and my eldest sister had moved down into the annex, it was then her bedroom. [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2199s). And of course, all I could think about at the time was, "Oh, if I just do this, it'll get dad right and we'll get back to the Brethren."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2209s)

Yeah, they'll forgive us and we'll be back.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2211s)

Yeah. I was very aware of how much shame that I had brought on my family by being shut up.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2223s)

And with the priestly visits, I mean, there's a huge power imbalance anyway because there's always two of them and one of you, whether you're male, female or whatever. But when you put it again in the context of saying you're a 15-year-old girl and you're in a room with two guys, you've got nobody to advocate for you, nobody to support you. I mean, it's horrendous. It's utterly horrendous, isn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2249s)

Yeah. When the abuse happened, there was just one of the guys. It was a father and son that were priests at the time, and it was the son that was in the room at the time. I didn't tell anybody about it. I knew it was wrong. I also knew in my head that, "Well, I've just got to get my dad back to the Brethren," because there was so much shame on the family. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2280s) that's all I could think about. So yeah, that happened when I was 15\.

Yeah, it's a bit shitty really, but hey, I'm alive and there's people that have gone through far worse. It's just the power and the control that grinds my gears, because they think that's how they can have one over on somebody. It's the control, the constant control all the time.

So yeah, we were let back in. And then when we were let back in, you mentioned earlier, Anne, about it not being easy when you're allowed back. I can remember the humiliation. Everybody now, at the time there would have been about 130 people in our locality. I can remember [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2332s) eyes turning round in the seats as I walked in, and I literally felt like a leper. I felt like I was stood there in this black cloak with a mask on, that nobody should look at. You're judged for being this impure, little sister.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2356s)

And you're treated like used goods, aren't you?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2359s)

Yeah. So yeah, that was... Do you know what's really ironic? Obviously, I was living in Basingstoke at the time. And last year, there's a Facebook group called "Basingstoke through the years" and they look back at old, you know, nostalgic photos and things like that. Somebody passed a comment about this particular high street and I commented and said, "Oh yes, I remember that well. On Saturdays we had to go and do the street preaching." And then I mentioned about the fact that if we did the street preaching, then we could have 20p to spend on penny sweets.

That was our treat. And this lady messaged me and she said, "Oh, I think I know you. Was your dad very tall?" So we got chatting. Anyway, it only transpires that where we lived at the time was a house in a close, and there were nine houses, and she was at number nine and we were at number four. Oh, wow. She said to me, "There was a long time when you were mid-teens that you just used to hang out the bedroom window, and I often wonder what you were thinking." And we got back to when she was talking about was when I had been shut up and shut in the bedroom.

So it's interesting how people notice things of what goes on. I'm still in touch with her, actually. It's quite interesting because we used to mess around with her young kids when we were really young, 10, 11\. They're now married with children [themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2462s). But yeah, it's interesting what people notice.

So yeah, that was really my sort of teen years. And then in '97, the two subdivision rooms of Newbury and Basingstoke moved into Reading city, and there were weird things going on. Very odd behavior from a local brother to some married women. And I had spoken to my dad about it and also spoken to one of the sisters about it who I got on very well with. And one of the other sisters was also my brother's wife, but he was behaving, he was sexually harassing them. And I can remember getting dragged into the toilets and being told to shush, I shouldn't talk about it. And that, you know, it's not what you talk about, you don't talk about this sort of thing.

So they must have known that things like that going on were wrong and they just wanted to deal with it their own way, their own law, Brethren law, which isn't even moral. Yeah, they're the highest court in the land, aren't they?

So yeah, that was really my life in the Brethren. And then I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2558s) working for my dad when I'd finished school. So obviously did GCSEs and then at the time the craze was to do open learning. Don't know if anybody remembers that. So I was doing A-levels from home, but we had to do it in a year as a form of discipline and we would go to college once every six weeks with some other Brethren children. I was the only one that wore my bloody headscarf. What a twonk. I mean, what a twonk, who does that? I'm embarrassed, honestly. I'm so embarrassed because I think, "You twonk, what were you thinking?"

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2607s)

Why did you toe the line? But at the time, you felt it was the right thing to do. So yeah, we get that, you know. Cringe, but...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2617s)

I mean, Anne, you've been there too at the time. Just remember you were doing what was best in the circumstances. I look back on some of the stuff that I told my boys to do, you know, stuff that they came and confessed to me and then I'd tell them to just cry to the spirit and things like that. And now I'm just so ashamed. But yeah, I know I was acting in what was best at the time.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2648s)

That's the thing, isn't it? That you do what you feel is the right thing at the time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2651s)

And I also think, Sarah, I imagine that you, I mean, I know how fond you were of your parents, or your father, I should say, as your father's no longer with us. You wouldn't want to do anything that would make the Brethren question him again. I can get that. You kept your headscarf on because you didn't want to attempt getting away with not putting your headscarf on. I get that. That's understandable.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2675s)

Very. But there was another Brethren girl there that didn't wear it and she used to take the piss out of me for wearing it. And it's just, yeah.

So I went to work for dad and, oh my God. So I met, I've got two boys who are coming up 19 and 15, and met their dad whilst chatting on the phone while working for my dad. Used to think he had a sexy voice. I'm so embarrassed even telling this, but I have to [tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2714s) you because it's so funny. Anyway, I took a fancy to him and we got chatting. We were chatting for a couple of years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2726s)

Was he a client of your father's company or just somebody he...

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2727s)

He was a supplier.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2727s)

He was a supplier, but obviously not a Brethren one.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2730s)

Yeah, so a non-Brethren company that were a big, big company that we used to buy from several times a week. Yeah, I thought he had a nice voice and we'd get chatting. We were literally chatting for a couple of years. I then was really losing interest in going to the meetings, so I used to feign a migraine sometimes so I didn't have to go.

I was actually really deceitful because obviously there were no mobile phones in those days, so I would ring his landline. He was in London. I'd give his landline three rings. The family had just gone to the meeting, okay? So I'd ring his landline, give it three rings, cut off, dial one of the family members so that if dad did a redial, I wouldn't get caught. Then I'd wait for him to call me back. But he would do it with a withheld number so dad couldn't do 1471 to work out who had rung. And we used to spend time chatting.

**Jacky Hart**

I actually think it was very clever. 

**Sarah Rowlands**

Yeah, so we used to spend a lot of time chatting and then one day he said to me, "I take it if you're not really interested in me, we better call it a day." Well, me being in my little mindset was like, "Oh my god, I love this guy and I want to get married and I want to have babies," and all that stuff that goes through your head like a twonk, as you do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2838s)

How aware was he at this point of the Brethren and the separation and their rules?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2847s)

He was very, very aware.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2850s)

So you talked about all that?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2850s)

Yeah, to the extent that, so he was living with his mum. Okay, bear in mind he's 19 years older than me, that should have been a red flag there and then, but it wasn't. So he left his job so that he didn't have to use a computer. And he started eating separately from his mum in the living room so that he could join the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2878s)

Gosh.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2880s)

He also was renting a flat down in Reading. I mean, he lost thousands. And I mean, thousands. He was renting a flat down in Reading. We would see each other on the quiet. But I was adamant that we weren't gonna have any sex because I didn't want the fornication flag on my head.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2905s)

The kiss and the grope, you weren't having anymore.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2912s)

I'm just thinking, Sarah, you know, you talk about red flags, and you should have seen red flags and things like that. But here you were as a, whatever age, young woman who was bullied and somebody was showing you attention.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2930s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2931s)

And you know, it's not surprising.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2935s)

And appearing to accept you just for that, yeah. And appearing to accept you the way you were.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2940s)

Yeah. I was purchasing manager for my dad and the reps used to come to work. There was one guy that used to come in, always kiss my hand, and oh my God, my dad went apeshit about that. "Dare you let a man kiss your hand." These guys, they were always asking me out on a date and I'd decline, and it was like, "Oh my god, I really just want to go out with them and have a drink," and couldn't. And I told them why I [couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=2971s). I was really honest.

But yeah, going back to my ex. So he gave up an awful lot to try and join. And then there were three-day meetings in late '98 that I had gone babysitting at in Salisbury. I sort of said to him, "Call my dad up and tell him you'd like to meet," because it would have been convenient, the fact that I wasn't there, that I was away at three-day meetings babysitting. Anyway, they met and dad loved the fact that he was very brotherly-looking and he read his Bible and yeah, whatever, whatever, all that jazz. And a couple of weeks later, I went to speak to the local priests about it, [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3025s) I had met somebody.

Oh, before, I need to rewind. So this was the November '98. Back in the March, oh my God, are you ready? Strap yourselves in. Back in the March, because he said to me, "Oh, I take it you're not really interested, we're not going to meet." I was like, "Oh yeah, I need to meet you." So I met him on the quiet. I gave him instructions of where to meet me in this shopping centre, what lift to get out of, not to kiss me when he saw me because there were lots of Brethren in their lunch hour in town. And that if you see me, just to act like you don't really know me, but you do know where I'm going, blah, blah, blah.

So we met in a multi-story car park in my car, where he asked me to marry him and I gave him my Bible because I thought that if I give him my Bible, I can be honest and tell my dad that I've met him to give him my Bible. I did that. We had a kiss and a grope in the car, as you do. Went back for more at tea time because it was quite good fun. At which point, this was a Monday night, and I didn't get back to the prayer meeting. And again, no mobile phones, anything like that. And my mum and dad had alerted the police as a missing person, and helicopters and the lot were out. My mum was absolutely frantic. [Uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3129s), she said, "Every road that we went down, every ditch that there was, I was making sure that you weren't in it," all because I'd stayed to just chat to my ex.

I got back quite late, nine o'clock that night. And how old would you have been at this time? I was 22\. Yeah, a grown adult. Yeah. So I was 22\. I had the headache from hell because I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3159s) feeling so sick with guilt. My sister was over from Ireland at the time. She was flying back that night, but I didn't go to the airport. I went to bed because I literally felt so ill from the guilt. Anyway, I couldn't hold it in. Got to the Saturday, about five days later, and confessed. I was standing in the kitchen ironing and one of the [sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3189s) immediately above me, she's 18 months older than me, I said, "Oh, I've got something to tell you," and she went, "Oh, you met someone, haven't you?" And I went, "Yeah." She said, "Oh, it's Trevor, isn't it?" And I went, "Yeah." I said, "How did you know?" "Well, you're always chatting with him on the phone." She said, "I knew it was going to be him."

And she was absolutely buzzing at the prospect that he was wanting to join. And then my mum was having a bit of a canary because I don't think Mr. Hales would approve of the age gap, because he was 19 years older than me. So that, and they made me tear photos up of him. They then started opening my post since I confessed about that. And even more so, everywhere I went.

Oh, I was really bad. It was things like on the way home from work, so we used to work eight till six and there'd be a half an hour travel, and I would say, "I'm going to get toiletries." And I wasn't. I bought them at lunchtime but planted them in the boot of my car. And I was actually going to see my ex to have half an hour with him. So yeah, the deceit side of things, [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3278s) stress that I put my parents through, for that I feel bad about. Or I did do for a long time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3285s)

But the system encourages that deceit. Because again, if you look at it in the light of day, okay, you were part of the Brethren, but you'd met a guy. That's not actually unusual when you're 22\. You wanted to see him, but because he wasn't part of the Brethren, that's when the deceit has to come in. And that in itself can tear you apart mentally, can't it? Because you know you're deceiving your parents, you're not being honest, and it's just wrong that you're in that position.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3319s)

Yeah. In my opinion, that isn't on you, Sarah, that is on them because they've created that system. The system creates that.

So I can remember each time I would leave the house, because my mum wasn’t a well lady and was incredibly stiff in the mornings, she would hear me going out but wouldn't be able to get downstairs in time. And I would see her hanging out the bedroom window shouting at me, by which point I'd got to the end of the drive, which was about 100 foot long. So I'd left with my headscarf on, and when I got to the end of the drive, my headscarf was off. That's how disinterested I was. I just couldn't be bothered.

But yeah, so dad spoke to some priests at the time, who were the same priests that visited me when I was 15, and told them about my ex wanting to join the Brethren and promptly shut me up. But they didn't tell me that they were shutting me up, they shut my dad up because I introduced an outsider to the Brethren. What? 7th of November '98. I'll never forget it. It was, I'd been around to my brother's houses, both of them, obviously with their young kiddies. We'd had a big box of fireworks each in the garden and I got home and Dad said, "Oh, you're shut up." And it was all because my dad had said to them, "Can we speak to this guy? He would like to join the Brethren."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3432s)

I'm speechless because it so flies in the face of their claim, isn't it? I know the claim is, "We're a mainstream Christian church." What do mainstream Christian churches do? Anyone can walk in. And you know, it goes back to the podcast that we heard recently, I think you were on it, Gilli, with Emily where she tried to join. And you're kind of giving the other perspective. They basically don't seem to want outsiders to join, [whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3462s) they say.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3464s)

Yeah. So that was November '98. My sister, the three of us living at home at the time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3478s)

And did they shut your parents up as well because of it? So in other words, by default, your parents were shut up.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3482s)

Yeah. It was one of the very few times that I saw my dad cry. I can remember it to this day. We were all absolutely exhausted but were hungry, but didn't want to eat. Ended up ordering a Domino's pizza and then didn't eat it. And I can remember seeing my dad standing in the kitchen crying. Couldn't understand what was going on. My sister, the one above me, went to live with my oldest brother. My youngest sister stayed at home. She didn't want to leave. She didn't leave till about four [weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3519s) after.

And it was really odd because I was a bit OCD at that point and we always used to have petty arguments about the fact that she didn't clean properly. Oh my word. And in that four weeks that she stayed at home, I don't know what it was, we sorted out our differences and never got on better. But she [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3549s) left and went to live with my oldest brother again.

But from that point on, I mean, when we were shut up, so November the 7th through to the beginning of January was absolutely hell because I started getting accused of doing things I hadn't done. The priest had said that I'd been seen at the train [station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3579s), I'd been seen out with this guy here, there and everywhere. And I could not cope with the mental pressure of being accused of these things I hadn't even done.

And of course, I was still working for dad and both dad and I were told that we couldn't go to work, even though it was dad's business. We used to go down in the evening. Well, dad would sometimes go in very early in the morning or I would go down in the evening. And I mean, who are they to say that a man can't attend his own business? All of a sudden the boys were running it, we weren't allowed to go. We used to go in the evening.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3633s)

Was your father able to speak to his sons?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3633s)

They would write each other letters. So he wouldn't sit and talk to them about the business, it would be, they'd have to leave notes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3648s)

Oh, boy. That's just cruel.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3650s)

Yeah. And the worst bit was that a few years prior, Dad had had a breakdown through the stress of work. And we were struggling. The guy that was working in the warehouse at the time, he was non-Brethren. I used to flirt with him terribly. He knew the boundaries of what we shouldn't do. But he was like a young Tom Jones. He was lovely. We used to wind each other up and then I'd get a bollocking for being friendly with him.

So he left and we couldn't get anybody to fulfill the post and that really stressed dad out. I can remember seeing him one day sat at his desk [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3698s) tears and he just, he didn't know what to do. He couldn't put one foot in front of the other. So that was a few years prior to me being shut up. But when I was shut up, he had another setback. And I don't know where it came from, but I grew some chesticles and had a massive go at one of the peebs because they were having a go at him for [crying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3728s) in the living room.

He was breaking down emotionally and was crying. And I was standing in the hall, sitting on the bottom step of the stairs. This was the man that abused me, by the way, bastard. I can remember him shouting at my dad and I don't know what made me do it, but I burst in the living room door, opened the door and said, "Don't you ever speak to my dad like that again. I think you need to get out of this house." I don't know where it came from because I was some meek little sister. [But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3759s) he was really humiliating my dad.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3762s)

It's interesting, isn't it? Because my father had very similar treatment. And I can remember my brother in the Brethren saying to me relatively recently, "But you chose to leave the Brethren." And my retort to him was, "Yes, I did choose to leave the Brethren, but nobody has ever asked why." And it was basically because of the way they treated my father. Right. You know, amongst other things, it was a similar thing.

Yeah. And also, Sarah, you know, they're big about respecting your elders. Well, I presume the priest you're talking about was younger, so where does that come in? 

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3789s)

Yeah, he was quite a bit younger than my dad. He's still around in the Brethren. But yeah, my dad had got so, I mean, I don't know if any of you knew my mum. You knew my dad, I think, Anne, a little bit. But he was very tall.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3825s)

Yeah, I knew both of them fairly well.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3827s)

Yeah. But he'd lost so much weight. I can remember seeing his trousers at the back all scrunched right in because he'd got so thin. Dad was just under six foot nine and was just about 18 stone, and he'd got right down to 15 stone and was just fading away. And it was like, you know, "What's happening to my dad?" And he was being mentally chewed up and [spat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3857s) out.

I'm absolutely convinced, and if my family get to watch this, and I hope they do, I am convinced my dad was removed from the Brethren. He died the day after he was 60 because of the stress and the humiliation that was caused. I have no doubt about that at all.

But yeah, so literally two months after we were shut up, I couldn't cope with the mental pressure of being accused of doing stuff I hadn't done. And I mentioned to my mum, "I think I'm going to leave the Brethren," at which point, this was the 4th of January '99, she wailed like a banshee. Oh my God. For two days, solid. Crying and crying and crying, and was petrified I was going to leave. And I did. I left the 6th of January. I left the family home. It was awful. I literally left with the clothes I was stood in. I wasn't even allowed a black sack to put any clothes in or anything.

And as I left the front door, mum said to me, "I hope that you're taken out there. I don't want you in this world." Oh my word. And I had, you can imagine, peeb attire because I didn't own a pair of trainers. So I had a quite a long skirt on, looked like a typical peeb, or for people that aren't familiar with the Brethren, an Amish girl because they're quite similar. No headscarf. But I can remember walking nearly two miles to where my ex's flat was, and by the time I got there, my heels were bleeding so bad with blisters.

[But](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=3970s) the worst thing about it was my parents followed me in a car. They were like the hearse that's really slow. They were sort of 50 foot behind every turn that I took to see where I was going. My ex was just going out to get a newspaper and I went, "Get inside, I need to talk to you. Get in, just get in, get in." So we spoke and then a few minutes later, my dad knocked on the door and was pleading with my ex to let me go back to the Brethren where, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4000s) know, it's the right place to be and blah, blah, blah. He persuaded me to get in the car and I said, "I'm only getting in the car if you promise to take me home because I need to get some stuff. I don't want you taking me away anywhere." And he did, he did take me home. But I literally wasn't allowed anything. They'd taken my car from me, house keys, the lot. And that day I went [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4030s) London, which was the biggest shock of my life.

Oh yeah, I've told this story before but I will never forget it. Getting on the train to London, and you know how Brethren male members don't wear shorts. And I hadn't even seen my dad in his pants, it would be pyjama bottoms. I can remember sitting on the tube, there was this man diagonally opposite me with shorts on and all I was thinking was, "Oh my god, he's got his legs out. I mustn't look. I must not look. It's impure to look. Do not look. He's got his legs out."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4076s)

What's the expression? Was it said that "God has no pleasure in the legs of a man" or something like that, wasn't it? Oh, how funny.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4088s)

I remember that vividly. That was on the Bakerloo line. And we literally turned up at his mother's door and he said, "Can Sarah come and live with us?" which is what I did for almost two years till we got our own place.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4106s)

Do you think, Sarah, your ex, if he'd been treated differently, so let's say the Brethren had spoken to him, was he really minded to give up what he needed to in order to join the Brethren? You said he'd stopped eating with his mother and he'd stopped, so he was of that mindset?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4123s)

Absolutely. Yeah, he was absolutely committed to join.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4128s)

Yeah. And they didn't even speak to him? Have I understood that correctly?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4133s)

My dad did, but the Brethren...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4134s)

I know your father did, but...

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4136s)

Yeah, my dad did with one local brother, just on one occasion. But oh, it was terrible, Jacky. He was living in East London, he used to get the train to Paddington and then would get the train out to Winnersh or Earley. And there was one night that he was coming down to spend the weekend in Reading and he'd got off the train and he'd tripped. It was dark, [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4167s) 10 o'clock at night. He tripped on a loose manhole cover and dislocated his shoulder. Now, bearing in mind there were no mobile phones or anything, but he'd called my landline because that was the only person that was close enough. And my dad said, "I'm sorry, I can't come and help you. We're shut up." And I've never, ever forgotten that. Oh, boy. It's, you know, just the level of control, excommunication.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4200s)

Yeah, the fear. The fear it instills in you. The fear of excommunication, what it will make you do in order to avoid it. Like with your father. And as you say, most people would say that's an inhuman thing for your father to do, but I'm absolutely certain your father wasn't an inhuman person. It was the fear of the consequences of doing that, wasn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4225s)

Absolutely. Because I know that there's been other things that I've witnessed as a child where he's helped the most random people out. I mean, he was known and respected locally by lots of non-Brethren people. And mum, you know, even when he passed away, mum said that there'd been over 600 people come and see his body, and a lot of them were non-Brethren members. Wow. But I wasn't allowed. [Yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4256s). But yeah, he was just that type of person. He was very kind and generous.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4264s)

Just the way he was. When he passed away, and I know this is a painful time for you, were you told that he'd been unwell? What were you told as the errant member of the family not in the Brethren?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4280s)

Yeah. So we had a guy that worked for us, a non-Brethren guy who was absolutely lovely, and after I left the Brethren, I stayed in touch with him. He was our accountant at work, a real comical guy as well, an older gentleman, lovely. So I stayed in touch with him and my ex and I would meet up with him a couple of times a year. He suddenly told me that December '99, my dad had had a kidney removed and part of his liver. So none of my family had made contact with me about that.

Then in 2001, I had then made contact with mum. We were down in Reading one day and went to find out where dad's new business premises were, and dad came out and told me then that he had a small lump on his femur and his rib cage, but he was awaiting further testing. That was November 2001\. Then 2002, my mum and my youngest brother phoned [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4363s) together to say that dad had been given six months to live. That the... oh sorry, I'm having a brain fart. 

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4385s)

You'll come back in a minute.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4387s)

Where was I?

Yeah, so mum had said he had six months to live. And then that was early January. And then one day in July, I had got up and said to my ex, "I'm not going to go to work today. I need to go and see my dad." So we were living in East London, we hired a car and drove part of the way and then got the train. I phoned my mum when I was about half an hour away and said, "Look, I'm half an hour away, but I really would just like to come and see dad."

So we went to see him and mum was caring for him in a bed. The diner had been converted to his bedroom. He was in one of those tilting beds because after they had removed, so the [cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4446s) moved, he had the top 15 inches of his spine removed and then developed a clot which they tried to remove but it paralyzed him. So he was paralyzed from the neck down. He could move his head, that was it.

So we went in and his breathing was so erratic and I was thinking, "Oh my God, he's gonna go while we're here." My dad was quite a hairy man, always [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4476s) hair on the back of his hands. And I can remember thinking to myself, "Oh my god, all the hair's gone. He's not got hairy hands." And it was just really, really, he was a fraction of the size that he was. And it was the only time that he told me that he loved me since me leaving the Brethren. And he let me, sorry, he let me give him a kiss. And he clenched my hand and he said, "Sarah, please come back to where you belong." And I just said, "I just want to tell you that I love you, dad." And two days later, he died.

It was, I don't know what it was that made me go and see him, but I'm glad I did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4535s)

I'd say, I bet you're thankful you did.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4538s)

Yeah, I'm so thankful that I did. There was a time before mum was caring for him at home that he was in hospital. And we went to find out where he was and I went to see him. And when I got there, one of the priests was there and he was in a side room on his own. And on the wall, there were photos blue-tacked of all the family, apart from me. And he'd been undergoing radiotherapy at this point.

And I can remember coming over really faint and thinking, "Oh my God, I need to get out of here because I'm literally going to flop." And I went to sit on a chair and the priest decided to come in and tell us to get out. And I don't know why, well, I do know why, it was out of respect to my dad, the fact that he was sick and in hospital and I didn't want to create a scene. You know, I wanted to tell the bloke to Foxtrot Oscar, but I didn't. I thought, "I'll leave out of respect to my dad because he's sick as well." And we just went. I remember me and my ex went and spoke in the stairwell. But you know, even at a time when my dad was really sick, there was no empathy or human kindness.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4624s)

Let alone Christianity.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4626s)

Yeah, that I might like to, you know, see my dad.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4629s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4630s)

And I think it's very powerful, Sarah, that you know, you said about 600 people coming to see your dad's body, a lot of them non-Brethren. You know, they were allowed and yet you weren't. I can remember when I visited the time before that, Ross, when I visited my mum, my sister from Scotland was down. And I hadn't seen her since I left and I literally fell [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4660s) the floor in the living room out of shock. But I then sat up and sat on the piano stool. And the thing that really pissed me off was that there were photos of the great men in the living room and George W. Bush. Good God. What? Not one of me. No. Not that I'm anybody important, but the whole thing of family, there's photos of all the family, but [yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4691s), you know.

One of the main mottos now is "family is at the heart of what we do." Yeah. It's the hypocrisy. They wouldn't know the meaning of family even if it hit them sideways.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4702s)

No, they wouldn't. Well, they have this notion that because we've made a decision to leave and have a difference of opinion, that we knew what we were doing. So we knew we were, you know, they claim that we leave them if we leave the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4725s)

Well, President Bruce Hales actually said in some ministry that those that have left us have forfeited their right to have contact with us, or words to that effect. So that's what they get told, don't they? And as you say, they come across as, "Well, it was your choice, you knew the consequences."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4743s)

I heard just recently from somebody that left that it was said about me that I just upped and left my five children. Not, you know, every single one of my children walked out my front door.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4761s)

But that's the way they like to portray it, Anne, to make you look like the bad party. You've got to be the bad party.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4766s)

And I have my youngest two live with me for three years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4770s)

Yeah. But yeah, they go around saying that.

I can't think of anything more ludicrous, Anne, because I spoke to you the day your daughter left home and I can tell you now...Yeah, that was not your choice. I remember that day.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4785s)

I remember that day. I was on the phone to my dad, if you remember.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4792s)

Yeah. And that's what they want to believe. But I think that goes, as you say, it's been said before, that goes along with they have to keep that narrative up to those inside, that all of us chose to leave. We all knew the consequences and actually we've got no right to say anything. And that feeds their arrogance about it all, in my opinion, doesn't it? It feeds their arrogance.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4820s)

That's almost like it's the one thing that they cling on to. They want to be able to throw that back at you that you chose to leave.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4827s)

Yeah. The whole, you know, if they could only see that we just want them to just let go of all that. And then this wouldn't happen. We wouldn't have to talk about it if they were like a normal church, would we?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4843s)

No. It's not even whether we go to their church or don't go to their church or go to any other church or don't go to church at all. It's the fact that when you leave, you lose everything. And that is what is wrong, isn't it? You lose your family, your children, your home, your job. And it's that that's wrong. So Sarah, since then, tell us a little bit about what kind of contact you've been able to have with your mother over the last 10 or so years.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4879s)

Very little. It's always been initiated by myself. 2018 was the last time I saw her in person. She was randomly moved back to Scotland, it'll be two years in October. That was as a result of her being poorly. That was another weird situation where I had a sixth sense that mum wasn't well and said to my boys, "I'm going to give mum a call after dinner." And then when I phoned, I was just met with, "This line is not in use." I thought, "Oh, okay, mum's moved and she's not told me."

And later that evening, I had a call from somebody who was in touch with [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=4938s) Brethren to say that mum had collapsed that night at the airport. Her heart had stopped, I later found out. But two of my siblings in particular have been absolutely vile. You know, when I heard that mum was sick, they wouldn't tell me anything about her. They were more concerned as to who I'd got my information from about mum being poorly than letting me know how mum was. They wouldn't tell me what hospital she was in. They lied to me about some of the circumstances. It wasn't until quite a bit down the line that I learned that mum's heart stopped. She's since had a pacemaker fitted.

But my second eldest sister was vile. She was so unsisterly, let alone being unchristian. Told me that I didn't need to know where mum was and I was just told the bare minimum of what I needed to know and I had no right because I left. Well, I mean, your mum is your mum, isn't she? You know, she is the one person, and I mean, she's 82 now. She told me very last minute about her moving back to Scotland. I'm pretty sure on purpose, there was no time for me to see her beforehand.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5041s)

Yeah, I remember you saying you didn't get a chance to go and say goodbye or anything, did you?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5046s)

Yeah, nothing. And do you know the thing that really bothers me is that dad is buried in Reading, in a double plot. And it was one of the questions that I'd asked her, "What do you feel about the fact that you won't be buried with dad?" And she said, "Well, initially I was a bit upset about it, but it's just his body, isn't it? Because his spirit's in heaven." And I just thought, no, to me it's more than that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5079s)

And it wouldn't have been what she wanted.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5080s)

No, and it certainly wouldn't have been what my dad wanted. You know, there's always, I've said it to many people, but there are always three people in their relationships. Whether you're talking about a marriage, a mother-daughter, father-son, father-daughter, there's always that third person, which is the Brethren. And the Brethren rules everything. You know, yes, I was brought up to know what was right from wrong, but my parents were hugely influenced by what was [acceptable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5118s) in the Brethren as to what was allowed, what wasn't, how I was disciplined. And it's, yeah, I don't know. I think there's a lot of loveless marriages in there.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5135s)

Yeah. I think I would verify that as well.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5140s)

I think that's a really interesting way of saying it about a third person.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5147s)

It is. It's just this third body in every relationship. There's an expression, and it doesn't come from the Brethren, but there's an expression around called "the thought police." And I think when you're in the Brethren, you live permanently with the thought police. And the thought police are that thing, some people might call it your conscience, but your conscience isn't of a normal level when you're in the Brethren, because you have a conscience about things that the majority of the population consider perfectly normal [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5178s) not wrong. And you live with that constant mental pressure, don't you? All the time. So, Sarah, the other thing I wanted to ask you is, you've had a lot to deal with and a lot of sadness. How's that affected you over the years?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5199s)

It's a million dollar question. It's funny you should ask, Jacky, because I left very early '99. And for the first six or seven years, I was pretty messed over in my head. I didn't know whether I'd done the right thing because I never planned to leave. Every time things were stressful, whether it was a work difficulty or a financial difficulty, it was like, "Oh, I want to go back, want to go back." And then I had to realise actually what I was wanting to go back to was my family and not the Brethren.

Early 2006, things became too much. I nearly took my life with my child in my car. Thankfully I didn't, but I was that desperate with the mental pressure in my head. But it was at that point that I said to myself that if I want to move forward in any way and build a life of my own, I've got to accept that I can't have my family, which as we all know is the hardest thing to do and it's easier said than done. But I also needed to think about my sanity and the fact that I was a mum and at some point was wanting a brother or sister for my 18-month-old at the time.

So yeah, it was when I had some health changes at that point. It was almost like I did what I needed to do, but now there's a physical consequence. Almost it was like a relief, a pressure off. I'd been holding on so tight for so long to something with hope that wasn't happening, that I think it was my body's way of letting go. So that was sort of 2006-7. We then made that film with Sky TV, if you remember.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5346s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5347s)

2015, I think it was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5349s)

2015, yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5350s)

Yeah, which was at that point I then thought, "Oh shit, I need a bit of help because I'm not over my past." I went to speak with my GP, opened up for the first time about where I'd come from and wailed like a banshee. She was amazing. But since then, life has been up and down mentally. She suggested I had some counseling, which I had some in 20... I had to have some surgery first for something else, so I didn't have the counseling until 2018\.

It was then that I realized about the sexual abuse when I was a teenager that I went to the police about. I did visit my mum to tell her that I was going to the police because I wanted her to hear it from me and not through the church. Mum was astounded. She was upset at the fact that dad had let me see a priest on my own, because obviously none of my family knew this. I also phoned to tell my two other eldest brothers what had happened.

And [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5424s) was their reaction? Well, my eldest brother pissed me off because he didn't know what to do with it, so he just told someone else. And I think to myself, "Oh, you've got children and that's the way you behave with situations like that." So that did piss me off. My youngest brother was much more understanding. I was obviously very tearful on the phone talking about it, just because it was such a relief.

So when mum was very sad but supportive, didn't know anything about it, blah, blah, blah. But then when the police got in touch with the Brethren and the Brethren went back to mum, she completely changed her tune and said that I was attacking the assembly and that I was a troublemaker and I was a liar.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5481s)

It's the age-old story, isn't it? Nothing must bring the assembly into disrepute, so we'll get a great big carpet and a brush.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5486s)

Yeah. So yeah, mum changed her tune about that. But if that's the way mum wants to deal with it, that's up to my mum. You know, I know what happened and I had to go to the police because I know that there are still situations going on of abuse in there and it needs to be flagged. That was my motive. It wasn't a prosecution case, it was a safeguarding reason [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5516s) I went.

So that was 2018\. I had some CBT, for those not in the know, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which hugely helps with your thought processes about things. It was amazing, absolutely amazing. One of the things I worked on was the incident of when I was 10 where our family was split up, because I wanted to work out why I got this bout of depression every year at the end of April. So that was really, really productive. We chatted about lots of [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5554s), but as she said, when you've had 22 years of abuse, you're never gonna have enough counseling to cover it. But I learned a lot from her, very, very beneficial.

But last year was probably my hardest year ever mentally. I probably should have gone on medication sooner than I did. Yeah, I'm on mental pills that I joke about because if I don't laugh, I'll bloody cry. I'm not ashamed of it. The fact that I need a bit of help to function in life, so be it. It's the way it is.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5603s)

I think most of us that have been through what we've been through are in the same boat.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5611s)

Yeah, I just think it's really important to talk about it and I promised myself after how things were at my previous job that I would be more vocal about mental health. So yeah, the last year, 2022, there were lots of changes with med changes and things like that and that's continued into this year. It's hard. I know I laugh and joke about it.

I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2016, which I had been living in denial about for a while. The thing that I hate the most is the nightmares. And they all have the same theme, they're all about trying to get away from the situation.

**Jacky Hart**

 And in your nightmares, Sarah, are you trying to get away from the situation but whatever you do to try, you can't?

**Sarah Rowlands**

 Yeah. And the worst bit is that I'll wake up, like I had one last night and at three o'clock I woke up. Sometimes I'll punch John or frantically try to come to in my dream, and my heart is going at the most stupendous speed, the biggest headache from hell.

Yeah, it's tough. It's hard, especially when you're a mum. I don't want my past to claim me and I will not be a victim. At the same time, there are days where I really, really struggle to function, to physically put one foot in front of the other. But I'm a stubborn bitch and that helps, I guess. But it's hard. People [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5733s) see beyond this sometimes, do they? It's not like a broken arm where you can see a plaster cast.

It's funny because one of my non-Brethren friends, she's 43, she's going through breast cancer at the moment, having a really, really rubbish time, chemo, radiotherapy. You'll know about this, Anne. It's hugely intense and her mental health has been affected for the first time. And she said that living with mental health was as bad as fighting the cancer battle because they're constant battles. You just got to constantly keep at it. It's been tough at times.

I'm trying to say as little as I can without boring anybody. You know, John is amazingly supportive. My kids understand that I've got my mental health issues, but they still love me as their mum. I still function as a mum. Yeah, I've had to very recently reduce my hours, which I hate doing because it's not what I wanted. But I was going to end up in a situation that if I didn't do that, then I wasn't going to be able to work at all. So yeah, it's trying.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5823s)

To say the least. And I think that's the one thing that we've tried to get across in all of these podcasts. I think every person that has left carries on with life and finds a life that's very fulfilling, but that pain never goes away. And I consider that I lost less than say, Anne did, or you did, Sarah, or Gilli, but that pain always stays with you, doesn't it? Of, you know, in your case, [Sarah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5854s), not seeing your mum, and in Anne's case, her children and also her parents. And it's there, but it's not that life isn't fulfilling now. You've got two lovely boys, Sarah. But that pain is always there and it gets too much at times, doesn't it?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5874s)

Yeah, it does.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5877s)

And that's what their manner in which they practice separation, that's what it does. And the one message I want to get across, I feel this so strongly, I think most of us would agree, and I've said it before, of keeping separate from evil, but not that physical separation. You can choose to walk away from something you don't agree with, but you don't have that physical separation [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5907s) to split families up like they do when they don't want to be split up, simply because one member of that family doesn't want to go to the church. That's the one thing that should change. There is no need for that.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5922s)

 Thinking about my early days after leaving, I can remember literally, I never planned to leave, so my evenings changed. I'm just trying to decide whether to switch a light on or not. Let there be light. Is that a bit... I don't know. Yeah. What was I talking about?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5967s)

Your evenings?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=5967s)

Yeah, I can remember just crying and crying and crying every evening because all of a sudden I wasn't at the meeting, and how exhausted I felt with crying. And as I mentioned earlier on, being out nearly 25 years now, my grief has moved and changed. For many years, I was literally, I mean, mentioning briefly about my dad earlier, that was the first time I've been tearful in a very, very long time because you get, I know it's so cliche, but time does heal. And it's not that it heals, but you become a new person. You learn to live with it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6015s)

I think the hurts, these aren't my words, but the hurts scar over and you learn to live with them. They don't heal like they're never there, but you learn to patch them up.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6025s)

Yeah, I was going to say you become a new you. The thing that I sometimes, not very often, but occasionally I feel inwardly angry about is the fact that I'm having to deal with the mental health side of things as a result of Brethren life. The fact that I've not been able to pursue a couple of things career-wise that I wanted to do. That's been very, very hard to accept. And yeah, that's the bit that I find more, it's the aftermath of it more than the grief itself. That's what I struggle with. That's the famous thing of acceptance, isn't it? But the fact that's...

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6088s)

What I was going to say was, I wanted to ask you two things, Sarah. One is, going back a bit, do you think that you will be told when your mum passes? And the other thing I want to ask, which is on a totally different track, is what would you say to anybody in there that's wanting to leave? What would your advice be?

**Sarah Rowlands**

Okay, firstly about my mum. So before COVID, I phoned my mum and said that I would like to meet her because I didn't want a repeat of what happened with my dad when he passed away. They didn't let me go and see dad's body and I wasn't allowed to go to the funeral, which at that point I would have gone to. We did gate-crash at the cemetery, which was the most humiliating thing ever because we were literally laughed at. But I wanted to discuss with mum what would happen when she passed, but she wouldn't meet.

My eldest brother got involved and then said that he wanted a list of questions that we wanted to ask, an agenda beforehand. I asked, of which, no, sorry, that doesn't work. I'm just not playing that game. But I even suggested if mum wanted to meet in a public park or a coffee shop or something like that, a neutral sort of place. But so when she passes, I [don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6202s) know what will happen. I do know that I won't be going to a peeb funeral. I'm not prepared to put myself through that mental pain.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6216s)

No, don't blame you. Can I just ask quickly before you move on to Ross's second question, which I think is a really good one. What reason did they give to you for not being allowed to go and pay your respects to your father after he passed away?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6230s)

They didn't, they just said that they didn't want it to happen. They didn't think it would be right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6231s)

It's interesting because he actually passed away about the same time as my in-laws. My in-laws passed away within two years of each other about the same time, and with both of them, the same era, my husband is also ex-Brethren, we were allowed to go and view their bodies. And you think, where is the consistency?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6255s)

What's really, really odd as well is that my mum had a sister, so obviously mum was from Scotland, and when my grandparents died, my mum's sister had been out since '76. Now, James Symington, I can't say Mister, James Symington kicked her out because she didn't do what he said. Now, she lost her husband at a very young age to cancer when he was around 40, and he told my mum's sister that she should flee to Reading to live with my mum, and because she didn't, he kicked her out. As a result, my Auntie Anne was quite sick.

I learned just last year that she since passed away. But going back to the whole viewing of the body thing, so when my grandparents passed away and we had the bodies in the home, my Auntie Anne who was withdrawn from, came down to see her parents. Yet I wasn't allowed to see my dad's. My mum, to be fair to her, she did since apologise for that and said that she should have obliged. But [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6334s) doesn't take away the pain that happened at the time.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6336s)

You don't get a second chance at these things that would have meant so much, do you? And then what about Ross's last question? What would you say to somebody in the Brethren who's struggling?

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6348s)

What would my advice be? Be true to yourself and whatever happens, beat to your own bloody drum. Beat to your own drum. Don't worry about conforming to this or that or what somebody else's perception of what you should be. Beat to your own drum. And as much as it might seem a mammoth task to want to leave, don't think about it all at once. Just one foot in front of the other because you'll feel overwhelmed.

But most of all, there's lots of help out here from us oldies and dinosaurs that have been out for ages. My door's always open to talk to anybody. I've always said that. I'll give you honesty in return, but yeah, my door's always open.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6414s)

Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And I think it's one of the biggest gifts you can give somebody is to allow them to truly be themselves. And unfortunately, that's not a gift the Brethren give anybody.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6429s)

If somebody was to say to me, "What's the biggest thing for you?" that's what I've always said. I can't believe, I mean, I do remember in peeb days that it wasn't cool for certain people to be seen chatting with certain people, or certain ages with certain people. Well, that's one of the things I loved and have learned so much since leaving, that you can hang out with anybody and everybody. If you get on, respect each other, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether you're black, white, fat, thin, purple, got one leg or two arms that are hanging off the wrong side. People, that's one thing I love, is that people, society in general, accept you for who you are.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6476s)

Yeah.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6477s)

And those that don't, well, bye.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6480s)

You don't need them.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6481s)

Yeah. And you're not forced to put up with anyone that you don't particularly want to.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6488s)

Yeah. Go to meetings with them and have meals with them.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6492s)

Yeah. I actually find that's one of the things quite traumatizing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6505s)

We've got to end it on a positive note, Sarah, so let's get back there.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6506s)

Yeah, but I have no regrets at all. Life hasn't been straightforward, but it definitely helps to have your glass half full.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6522s)

And I think one of the other things that you can feel really proud of is that you've been in a position to give your boys what most people would perceive, and I use the word "normal" in inverted commas, that they haven't had the life that all of us have had in their childhood and been allowed to do the normal things growing up without the restrictions that we had.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6543s)

Yeah, I think that's a wonderful thing you've been able to do. I feel very blessed in that respect. And one of the things I love about my boys is that, I mean, we're very open as a family. Probably because I didn't want it to be like my past where you couldn't even say the word "sex" without getting on your knees and putting a hanky on your head. But we are very, very open and we talk about anything and everything. And you know, if one of the boys has done something or tried something, they come and tell me. And I feel really blessed that they do that. I've always said [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6588s) them, hypothetically speaking, "I'm not worried about what trouble you get into, but just talk about it so we can sort it out. If you lie, I'll grow horns."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6600s)

Yeah. Be open and transparent about it.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6603s)

Yeah. But then they can only do that if they don't fear the judgment, if you see what I mean. Whereas, as I say, in an environment like the Brethren, it goes back to, it makes you deceitful because you know if you're honest, you're going to get into trouble and have judgment and be shut up. But no, life is good. Despite its hurdles, I am very blessed and very thankful.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6622s)

Well, I often say to people, you lose everything, but you gain your freedom.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DMSrrj7-u30o%26t%3D6632s)

Absolutely, Ross, absolutely. And that's priceless.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6639s)

Well, Sarah, thank you so much for coming on and telling your story. I find it particularly interesting because you met somebody who would have done a lot, given up a lot to have been in the Brethren. It was just an avenue that was never opened to him or you, and the consequences of that. But you're fighting on, and thank you so much for sharing your story. We really appreciate your time tonight.

### [**Sarah Rowlands**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6668s)

That's all right. Thank you for having me. Thank you. I've enjoyed it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSrrj7-u30o&t=6672s)

Cheers, Sarah. Cheers, Sarah. Bye.

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)
