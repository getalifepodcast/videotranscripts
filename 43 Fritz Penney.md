## Summary

Another brave young man speaks out about how it feels to be gay in the brethren. Fritz talks openly about how different he felt in a very closed community. He tells a story of bullying through his teenage years and the worthlessness he felt as he realised that he would never fit into the community he was born into. The manner in which Fritz describes how gradually contact with his much loved family ceased will strike a chord with many others that have left. He talks candidly about how he has gained confidence as a person after leaving and shares with us an incredible creative talent that would never have been nurtured within the brethren. This story is a testament to anyone that there is kindness and love in this world, and the freedom to be yourself is liberating.

This is the Get-A-Life Podcast. Ex-Cult Conversations.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=7s)

Hello everyone and welcome to the Get-A-Life Podcast in the UK. And this evening I've got with me my lovely friends. We've got Ross Turner and we've got another Ros, Atmore, and Jacky Hart. And our special guest this evening is Fritz Penny. So Fritz, good to see you and welcome to the podcast. Looking forward to hearing your story and let's get started.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=37s)

Excellent, yeah so hello I'm Fritz Penny. I was brought up in the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church in Southampton, so we're on the south coast of the UK. I was, I'm now Fritz Edgar Penny. I was brought up Fritz Howard Morton, so very different but I took my husband's name when we got married and the Edgar part I'll explain later.

So I've got three siblings, so I've got two brothers, I've got an older brother, a younger brother and I've got a sister who came a bit later so she's 10 years younger than me.

My parents both came from large families, so dad is one of seven children and mum is one of six. They've all got married, had kids. Apart from dad's younger sibling, he had something called Edward syndrome, which meant he died after a day after being born. But he was born a month exactly before I came along. So he was April 25th, I was May 25th. So it meant I had a particularly [special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=103s) relationship with my paternal grandparents. Um, yeah, we were really close as a family, very close. Even cousins, first cousin, seconds, we were really close. Um, I was very close to my mum, um, and yeah, she was obviously my mum. She would get frustrated with me, she would nag me to do this, that and the other, cleaned my room up and the rest of it. Moms do. Yeah exactly, yeah.

She was also my best friend. We would chat for hours, she would ask me advice on her outfits and headscarves and shoes and the rest of it. And we'd shop together and I loved doing the Sunday dinner with her. She's amazing.

She's really loving and selfless and she really loved life.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=152s)

So perhaps should explain for the outside listeners, Sunday dinner attended to be a bit of a thing in the Brethren, didn't it? A sort of a large, I mean you explained Fritz, but it was a large roast you'd probably have, what, up to 20 people around and all.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=166s)

Yeah, absolutely. We had, we weren't very well off at all. We didn't have the biggest house in the world. I shared a bedroom with my brother up until the day I left. Um, so yeah, we didn't have that many around and it was, it was always very high pressured. There's always an, um, expectation of what the meal and the, you know, the time was going to bring. Um, so yeah, so I only remember, probably kind of felt that a little bit. 

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=194s)

Um, yeah, there's an element of almost competition about it. Yes, absolutely. So your mum probably really appreciated some help with it, because all I know is I didn't have to do it because I wasn't married in the Brethren but Andy didn't you and was did, I'm sure yeah. Yeah, and it was darn hard work, wasn't it?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=210s)

Yeah. And of course, sorry, Ross, go on.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=214s)

Yeah, no, my mum, Fritz, we were in the same boat as you really, we weren't very well off either. And my mum used to get so hot up about a Sunday because she knew, you know, all the best was expected and we couldn't afford it really. Anyway, sorry, go on Fritz.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=227s)

That's right. That's exactly. And of course the Sunday dinner was always the woman's job in the Brethren. It always fell to the woman to do. So obviously from that point I was always looked at a little bit differently because I was in the kitchen rather than entertaining the Brethren as I probably should have been.

But yeah, I've got this amazing video of mum that I really treasure that I've got now of her. We used to be responsible for opening up the meeting rooms before the Brethren came and sort of get the meeting room ready and one night we was in one of subdivision meeting, so one of the little meetings in the area, and um, this mum decided to jog around the car park in our high heels and she's got this incredible laugh. It's a really cheeky chuckle and it's, it's incredible because I, I treasure it now because it's obviously one of [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=276s) very few videos or sounds I've got of her and it's amazing. It just shows what a person she was.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=282s)

Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=283s)

Um, yeah, so we were, we were brought up, I would say in a very strict household. We always followed the rules. We, we certainly weren't any near the top of the rung of the ladder in the Brethren in our, in our city. Um, we certainly didn't feel like it. Um, so yeah, and I would always say I was a particularly good boy, always followed the rules and said the right things, I think. Um, in school I was, you know, I followed the rule to every letter. Um, I [only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=313s) got my name on the board once in my entire life and that, and I think that transferred from what we've been taught at home. But also going to school, I was, you know, just had, yeah, felt like I needed to follow the rules.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=325s)

Yeah, so you were of an age where you were in one of the OneSchool, Brethren schools, not a mainstream school?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=332s)

Absolutely. So I was homeschooled from earliest to year two, um, per month. Um, don't remember much about that. State school was year three to six, um, so we went to state school. That during that time we were very much the odd ones out. So we weren't allowed to touch or use computers, use the TV. Um, you know, if there's prayers in assembly we'd have to walk out, that kind of thing. Um, so yeah, the Brethren school was from year seven to the end of the education college. Um, yeah, hated it, but I think the sort of the hierarchy in the Brethren very much transferred into the hierarchy in school.

There was a lot of different bullying going on, particularly. I was very much the odd one out in the school anyway, especially with the rest of my male classmates and that's obviously when I started feeling particularly different. I remember pretty much my whole time in the Brethren school, they used to mimic how I spoke. So when I had to read out loud the class, I just dreaded it. So I'd have these people in the background [mimicking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=404s) me because and eventually I just stopped talking. I just thought, okay, I'll just be silent. Um, and there's one particular lesson where the boys, um, that the, the class, the teacher asked us what our favorite lessons were and of course the boys were like, woodwork, PE, all the rest of it. And, um, I answered history and art. And I remember a boy behind me turning to his classmates and whispering loud enough for me to hear, "He's gay." And wow.

I obviously didn't have a clue that was what it was at that point, but also I knew that it wasn't a good thing, that was wicked and evil. And the fact that someone had labelled it on me without me even realising that's what it was, it would put the terror in me.

So yeah, so I people often ask that, when, when did I know? And I don't think I can actually put a date on it or anything like that. I always was different.

My brothers were in a sort of, the brothers live in a world of stereotypes.

So my brothers loved being outside, they loved chopping trees and playing with cars and this kind of thing. Dad was a builder, so he loved doing projects in the house, carpentry and that kind of thing. And I was inside helping mum baking when I was little, while I was dressing up in mum's heels and putting on plays and shows and that kind of thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=482s)

And they didn't realise.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=484s)

Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So I was always the odd one out. I felt even, you know, in my own family.

But yeah, they, they, and they always used the word gay as a slur. It was always, you know, that's gay, that sounds gay, you sound gay, you look gay.

And all those supposedly small messages were actually, they all embed themselves in your mind. They all create this massive shame complex in your head. Um, so and that's still something that I, you know, I, I battle.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=518s)

I remember we were talking to Ross, he sort of said that, that though that being on him, compounded with that in the Brethren environment, resulted in him feeling quite worthless at times. Did you have a similar emotion growing up?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=535s)

Absolutely, yeah, because I was already, I knew us, we're in an odd environment anyway. Um, you know, people would look at us weirdly in the shops and, um, but then you also, you're in a minority in a minority. So you're, I was already, you know, feeling like an odd one out. Um, and yeah, you do feel like, you do feel worthless, especially when you're not particularly high up in the the whole system.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=565s)

Yeah. You said Fritz, you still feel shame to this day. Um, do you have days where you don't like yourself for who you are?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=574s)

Yeah. So it was, it was worse obviously when I first came out, um, but I've got better at it. There's just times I think when I meet, um, particularly when I see Brethren in the shops, it all comes flooding back. That is a big trigger. Um, I saw mum in our local supermarket last year, I think it was. Um, and I firstly I hardly recognized her, she, she didn't, uh, look great. Um, and but I ran off. Literally pulled my husband around and was like, I don't know where he's gone. And I [messaged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=610s) his mom after saying, I, I saw you but I just ran off. And she was like, why do you think that was? And I just, it's the fear that I've, it's been created since all this time. There's no contact, this, the shame that's built out, what's happened.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=624s)

Yeah, I can fully understand exactly where you're coming from there.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=628s)

Yeah. So I think, so when I was 18, I, that was the first time I, so I started talking to a guy using my Brethren mobile, that was a dumb thing to do, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=640s), and my parents called me down one evening and asked what this number was in my phone bill that appeared so often. Um, I denied all knowledge and they said, well, it's from an area where there's no Brethren, there's no, there's no excuse for that. Um, still denied everything. 

And eventually I was so wrapped with guilt, I just sent a little letter of my confession under their bedroom door and eventually I had my first priestly the next day. Um, and even one of the stand-up points then was, [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=671s) of them asked, you know, on these apps, is it just men, is it just women, or is it a mix? And I said, said, oh, it's just men. And it didn't go any further. Yet when I came out properly, they were shocked that I came out as gay. So I don't know where that thought process was, but ridiculous. But what was ironic about that is that was during the time before RRT, so there's their PI days, which I think stood for Public Interest events or something.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=698s)

Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=700s)

They opened up their meeting room car park where you could go and have a bacon roll and a chat or something. Um, and we had to go and my brother and I had to go and pick up the signs from my brother. Um, and ironically it was in Brighton. So we spent the day in the, right, the next day, Brighton was obviously a particularly known city for their LGBT community.

But yeah, then eventually I sort of started buying phones from other companies. I realised my mistake. I still remember the first time I went to Argos to buy my first phone, I was still convinced that they would be able to track me through Wi-Fi or something. It was sort of, he had this embedded thought that they're better track you whatever you do, whatever protection you put around you, they'll still get you. Um, and but anyway, eventually turned out that dad would find it under my mattress or in my clothes drawer or anywhere else I could possibly try and hide it. Um, but yeah, through getting those phones, I started finding out about just the outside world. Um, and of the, the gay community as well.

 Finding out I'm not the actually the only gay in the village. Um, and it's ridiculous, but I generally thought I was the only one in the world, let [alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=778s) in the Brethren, that felt this weird feeling that I was, knew was different from everyone else. Um, it blew my mind when I actually found out there's another gay brother. I thought, that's absolutely incredible, you know, it's not just me that's suffering from this. Um, and I, yeah, I remember the first time, because I really battled with it, you know, I prayed against it, prayed that I'd get cured. Got to the point where I was, before I escaped, I was praying to God that I would, he would either cure me or take me. I die. And just because it was, it's got to that stage where I was like, if this is what he wants from me, to be cured, then he would do it. Otherwise, let me go, because this is, I can't.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=818s)

Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=819s)

And then yes, during that time, I, I did eventually, um, sort of accept that I was gay. Just, I remember talking to myself when we were going to one of our many walks in the countryside with the family and, um, it first time I said it, just didn't, it didn't feel evil or wicked or anything. It just felt right. It, it didn't suddenly bring in all the feeling of, um, yeah, wickedness that I thought it would.

Um, and then yeah, so I realized I couldn't obviously continue my life in the Brethren. It wasn't gonna, wasn't gonna work. The expectations that were creeping up for me regarding buying a house and getting married, you know, I was 21, I was a year off from being expected to get married.

Um, and I went through stages of getting rid of these phones and then buying them again and getting rid of them. And one time, my boss pulled me out the office and said, look, we know you've got a worldly phone.And it turned out his wife had rummaged through the company car that I was using and found some packaging on the mobile phone. Very weird that went in the shredder. Yeah, and I think the more I saw the outside world, the more I felt.

There's one particular time on a Sunday dinner, someone else's house and I thought, you know, I just, I really want to get out. I really feel like I just, you know, I need to, need to stop this. And ultimately I could have got up and walked out the front door, but the mental prison that you're in is incredible, the way they build it up, um, and make you feel like you're physically restrained. It's, it's amazing. Um, so I met Paul in 2014, um, ghosted him for about six months, not proud of that. Um, and we met, started meeting up for walks, literally just walking and talking and sharing life experience. 

But I always kept my background as a secret. I, you know, I had this underlying fear that he would go to the press. Like we've all been taught this fear of the attacks from the press and we had these special meetings to pray against the attacks of the press and, um, I generally thought he would go and expose me and the Brethren and it'd all, yeah, come to a bad end. Um, and one time when we're on these walks, he said, um, so are your parents religious?

It's a bit like, um, how'll I get out of this one? Um, he was like, so they're Mormon or JW's or? I said, oh no, they're Brethren. And he actually kind of knew about the Brethren already. He had actually, um, been told to go to a, he comes from a religious background. He had already had been told to go to a church in Basingstoke, not the Brethren church, but he ended up turning up at the Brethren door and they told him he had the wrong church. So we [could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=993s) have met in the Brethren, weirdly, but he was turned away because he wasn't the right person. So there we go.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1001s)

He obviously wasn't well disposed, I think that's the word.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1004s)

Absolutely not, yeah that's right, yeah. To be honest, he wouldn't have lasted five seconds to be fair, because yeah, he would have asked too many questions and broke too many rules. Um, yeah, and but that time he started talking about his relationship with God and it was, I found it absolutely incredible because he talked about him like it's his best friend. And it was the way he talked about was so real and so loving. Um, I'm not religious in any sort now, but the way he talked about his relationship then and it, it blew my mind that someone out here in this [supposedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1037s) wicked world and who's also gay could also have this amazing relationship with his God. Um, so yeah, I've introduced, I told him I want to escape, get out. He became very emotional. He's got four children, so the thought of him losing a child was something he couldn't comprehend.

Um, and then so I started planning my escape. So I started, I became paranoid about everything. So put lists together of things to take, things to do, people to speak to. I put timetables together of when the family would be in the meeting rooms or at home or in the church. Um, but it all came to a bit of a, a messy end. Um, so one afternoon I was late home from work, [partly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1088s) on purpose. Um, and I got, started getting messages from family that didn't used to message me that much and, um, so that, yeah, yeah, we arranged to go around to one of my family's house because they wanted a cake done or something. When I got home, my dad was there, which is also odd. The householder wouldn't ever stay home for a meeting. Um, and he asked me to stay home, wait till mum comes home. And then eventually mum came home and I was told to go upstairs to speak to her. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1119s), and each step of that stair felt like an absolute mountain. 

Uh, and yeah, she was in, sat on her bed sobbing and she motioned me to come sit next to her, which I did. And she produced this list that she had found in my wardrobe. Um, and it literally said on top, "Things to take when I leave." So kind of, there was no getting out of it. Um, and yeah, she was, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1149s) could tell the fear was very much a fear of what I was about to do, but also fear of where I was going to go because she generally thought that I had no one out here. She was saying, you know, wait, who you're going to go to? There's no one out there for you and the rest of it. Um, eventually I said I had to go for a walk then, called Paul and said, look, you need to come get me tomorrow morning. It's once they find out, it's, that's it. Um, there's no escape from it. You, they start putting things in place to try and keep you in.

And I thought there'd be a window of time the next morning where my mum would take my sister to school and my siblings and dad would be at work. But the next day they made sure someone was at the house the whole time. So I made out I was going to work and, yeah, so Paul came eventually and we sat there for what seemed like a lifetime. He was sort of saying, you know, are you going to do this?

And I knew that it was either we go now and there's no return or, you know, there's not much other option. So we raced off to Winchester, feeling like we're being tracked by every Brethren in the world. It turns out there was Brethren sent out to search for me after I told them that I'd gone.Um, yeah, and that was it. I went back to Paul's house and that was the start of this rollercoaster basically. Um, I did have my coming out letter which I thought I could possibly share if you wanted me to or...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1249s)

Yeah, that'd be great to see that, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1252s)

Um, it's, it's very much Brethren speak. I put this together way before I left. It took about, I don't know how many tries to put this together to make sure I had included everything. Um, so it does talk a lot about God, but you know, that's the way we're brought up. Um, so I put, uh;

 "Dear Dad, Mum, I'm sorry to do this to you, but I've made a decision to leave the Brethren. This hasn't been a rash decision. I've thought and prayed about it for months and I've needed to get my thoughts around it. [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1283s) apologize for not telling the truth when dad had that chat the other day. I thought I was doing what was best. You're the best dad and mum I could want and I've got two brothers and sister who I love very much.

 I don't want any of you or any of the Brethren to think it's something you've done that's made me move away. I'm very grateful for the support you've all given me and obviously all that you've given me over the past 21 years. I want to tell you a few things that will hopefully help you understand why I've made this decision to leave. I've known all my life that something was different about me. [Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1313s) from when I was a kid, I felt something wasn't quite the same as everyone else, but I wasn't able to figure out what it was. As I've grown older, I've learned what it's all about and it's been tough to come to terms with and it's been a big part of why I've struggled over the years.

To cut straight to the point, I'm gay. I know this isn't something you wanted to hear and it certainly wasn't something I wanted to accept. I've prayed about this for years, praying that I would change. I spoke with God and asked that I either be changed or he would take me. I fought against it, fought against my feelings, but I found that it can't change and that is how God created me. It's not a choice. I mean, who would choose to be gay anyway? It's how I've been made and we all know that God doesn't make mistakes. Only in the past couple of years I've come to terms with it and had to [accept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1358s) it, but I've had to show a different side of me to the Brethren, so I've been feeling like a fake and I've been living a lie that I can't do, and I can't do that anymore. That's not what God wants anyone to do.

I found that God loves me and even if I am gay, as we serve a God that loves all men. I want you to realize that I'm not leaving because the world looks like an exciting place. It's because I can't live a life that's two-faced. We all know that the Brethren don't accept gays or any other sexuality in fellowship, so I've made a decision to move away. A decision I knew would cost me everything I knew and everything I had. I do just want to say that coming to terms with who you are is a very, very real struggle that can't be taken lightly. I want to point out that when I was, [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1401s) as a young person going through this, it's very confusing and bewildering and also extremely frightening. I've also hoped and prayed that something, that's it's something that's passing, but it won't change. Yet you have people around you telling how corrupt we are, how that we are all against God.

 I have personally experienced name calling of the worst kind that probably didn't mean anything to the person who said it, but it hurt me badly. So please be sensitive and make people then realize that they are loved, whoever they are. Don't make [disparaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1431s) marks or criticize anyone when you don't know what's going through, going on deep and down inside them. I love each one of you. I don't want to do this, but I have no, I have to. I love you. I love our savior and I can only pray that you'll be given me the understanding of what this is about. Uh, I want to meet with you this week to collect the rest of my possessions. I want to thank you all for what you have done for me. You've brought me through times of good and bad and I don't regret anything. I don't hold anything against any of the Brethren and I hope one day a person like me is accepted and [loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1461s) as much as anyone else. Love you all, your son."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1464s)

Wow. Wow, gosh. Did you send it? Did you get a response from sending?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1472s)

So, so I emailed her because I didn't have the guts to say it to them face to face. Um, when actually, when I spoke to mum that time she spoke to me about finding the list, I was so close telling her then, but leaving the Brethren is one thing, also being gay is another level that I just couldn't deal with at the time. Um, so I just didn't feel it was the appropriate time. So I emailed it to them. They took, I think it was about a day to respond. Um, and the first thing was, "we'd had no idea," um, which still baffles me.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1500s)

But yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1501s)

There we go. Maybe that's my head now that I can, I don't understand it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1504s)

It's denial, isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1506s)

Yeah, absolutely. And also I think it's a little bit of, they said when I first came out, they said, we won't tell anyone else about the situation. And they, "situation" was always the code word for gay. They couldn't say it. Which is fair enough, you know, it took me a while to say it myself. Um, but yeah, they, they said they didn't tell anyone. Turned out they told a few, but there we go. Um, I think it's probably to help people to understand, especially like my older brother and that kind of thing. Because I was a, you know, compliant Brethren boy, for me to suddenly leave, I guess they had to have an explanation of why I would suddenly up sticks and ditch everything that I had ever, ever known, especially when they knew I was so close to mum. It wouldn't make sense for them, especially that my little sister was 11 when I left. 

[Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1550s), the first time I went back to the house to collect the rest of my stuff, she had no idea I was there. She came to my bedroom where my parents were, um, sort of telling me, you know, you don't have to take everything, you don't have to take everything. Um, and yeah, my little sister came in, she just burst into tears. And she was someone, she's quite like dad, she never really showed that much emotion when I, when I knew her. Um, you know, she had three older brothers, she had to, you know, hold her own. Um, she was, but we were obviously fiercely defensive of [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1580s), but she, yeah, that's the first time I've seen her properly just completely break. And again, it's that fear. It's the fact that she thought I was going into this weird, wicked place, even at that age of 11\. 

Um, I did see her a couple times afterwards, where I went to collect a couple of other bits afterwards, and she treated me like she had always treated me. You know, I looked very different, um, but she was telling me about a pet rabbit, she was telling me about school, it was like nothing has ever [happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1610s). It was amazing. Um, but yeah, so, yeah, I also want to touch on what's happened since because I wanted to tell people actually that's, yes, there's the trauma and there's the pain and the grief and, um, also there's also the life on the other side. Um, because I'm now loving life, I'm a lot more confident. Um, you know, last time I saw Ross was probably in a meeting room, which is probably quite a weird thought but um, yeah, I, I feel like a different person. Um, I wouldn't say boo to a goose when I was in there. Um, and just...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1652s)

…a little boy somewhere, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1655s)

Yeah, exactly. I didn't feel like an anyone, I don't think my family felt like an anyone either really, but, um, so yeah, when I first left the Brethren, I, I never could put on weight. And it's a little bit of a brag, but also I didn't like it either, but after the Brethren I went down to 10, under 10 stone. Um, I'm now 15.5 and very proud of it. So yeah, it's really, I do really feel it's like, it's only been in, especially in the last two, three years, it's just how contented I'm feeling. Um, just comfortable. Um, so part of my getting out and coming out and finding this new journey has been finding all the amazing connections from this outside world to the inside world. Um, when I started following one of the ex-Brethren Facebook pages, um, one [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1708s) my, so a third cousin I think he is, he has also left, um, before I did, and his auntie messaged me, she's also ex-Brethren and she messaged me saying, um, I'm in touch with your family in Canada.

And so my grandmother on my mum's side, she is the only one in her family that stayed in the Brethren when there was some sort of split in the seventies. She was already in love with my grandpa. She was 16\. They got married, not very, not much later. And the rest of the family left.

So my great grandpa and grandma, two uncles and an auntie, and we never, obviously never spoke to them. They'd turn their backs on the Brethren and the great man at that time. Um, I remember seeing a photo of them once, but we never knew their names. They were wicked. 

Um, we had been told that my great grandpa and great grandma had died, died in their sins we've been told. Um, so yeah, so I had this message saying we're in touch with your Canadian family. I hadn't even thought about it when I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1773s) planning to leave because they were never part of our lives. Um, and yeah, so I got a message from my great auntie from Canada and they sent over two photos of them all and it was incredible because they look just like me. It's amazing. And my great-grandma is very much alive. She is now, so this year she'll be 94\. Up till COVID, she spent all her time volunteering at a homeless shelter.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1810s)

Wow, gosh.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1813s)

Yeah, and I remember that we, so we organised me to have my first phone call with her and of course I didn't know what to expect and I was also incredibly nervous, but she answered the phone and there's this sweet little English sounding lady on the other phone and we both cried. It was amazing. She's an incredible human being, um, absolutely beautiful human.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1840s)

A little bit like the story you told us when you met your grandmother you never knew.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1849s)

It's you have these things that they said that about them and you believe it and then you find out there's actually, that's she, I mean she volunteers her time at homeless shelter when she's in her early 90s. I mean that's, what sort of wicked human being does that, do you know? Exactly, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1869s)

They sound like evil, um, people and they're these sweet, darling and most Christian people that you were kind of like so genuine.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1883s)

That reminds me of my story as well Fritz, because my uncle on my mum's side left at Aberdeen and they're over in the Isle of Man and I'm now in touch with my cousins over there and they just welcomed me with open arms straight away the first time I spoke to them. Um, and like you say, you know, your great granny, she's, uh, been volunteering for, you know, the homeless. Well, my cousin was coxswain of the lifeboat over in the island, you know, risking his life [for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1914s) you know, just voluntarily. Yeah, exactly. It just, yeah, it's, it's still, yeah, it's, it's amazing.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1920s)

So my grand, great grandpa, he had, he has died, um, but his first name is Edgar. So, um, yeah, I asked my great grandma if I could take his name when we, when I got married and she, yeah, she was over the moon because obviously we've had no connection. We're very much separated, obviously separated in every way. Um, and I met my great uncle. He came over to visit his son who's now living in London. Um, and yeah, he gave me the biggest, warmest hug and just said, welcome to the family. And it was just, yeah, still gives a goosebump now.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1954s)

Yeah, that's that sense of belonging, isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1958s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1960s)

Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1960s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1963s)

And family does mean so much because your own have discarded you. In, I don't mean that they have literally, but they've had to. And so when, when you get that genuine warmth and love from someone that doesn't know you but is family, then it means so much. And it's just, it's the weird way that you have that connection immediately.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1990s)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=1993s)

The same thing happened with me with my cousins. Um, we're all so similar. It was like being sort of part of my family again. Sort of these girls are just sort of, yeah. And it's amazing.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2007s)

It's like you've known them for years, isn't it? Not just, you know, just meeting them for the first time. Yeah, absolutely.

Yeah, and there's another time when, um, so there's these, this lovely couple who my, my Paul were, was got in touch with and was friends with before I appeared on the scene. Um, so he met them through the street pastors in Winchester. Um, and so my, my the, the, um, elder my friend, she is German. Um, and my auntie in the inside, she got engaged to a German guy and moved to Dusseldorf, um, quite a while back. Um, she was really [dedicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2046s) to learning the language and used to babysit my sister so she could, during the meetings, so she could do her German homework and this kind of thing. And I really, put a big love of the German language and I loved going to Germany and it was ironic that obviously my name is Fritz as well. But, um, the wedding celebration, um, my friend Imelda was talking to my cousin who left the Brethren and it turned out that my friend Imelda had been my auntie's German teacher.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2074s)

Oh wow, wow.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2076s)

Had this incredible connection that we never knew. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So she's, she had spent some time in my grandparents' house as well. It was just, wow, it's, yeah, just shows that you know, it also means, sort of makes you realize it is meant to be. You know, if it was this wrong, then why does it all snap up so quick, so right?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2098s)

Yeah, it sort of gives you sense of belonging, doesn't it? Because you've got this, okay, they're not your immediate family, but there's this extended family who accept you just the way you are. And I don't care who you are, all humans like to fit into a community of some description, don't they? Um, and it, it gives you that, I mean, I know you've got your husband, but it gives you that extended feeling of belonging, doesn't it? Which is so important for well-being, isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2125s)

Yeah. So absolutely, when in the Brethren, obviously you're so walled up, you're so enclosed in this community that, um, feels like it's physically, you're in a different community. You know, you feel like you're in a separate world to the fact that realize actually there are connections that cross over into the other world. Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2145s)

Yeah, it ties it, it's just that continuation. I mean and, yeah, I mean the Brethren call themselves the community and they refer to any, now I understand they refer to anybody outside as non-coms, as in non-community people. Oh, that's a new one. It was one that was an insider used to me recently. So I thought I'd pop that, a non-com. A non-com, yeah, a non-com. So it is a community, but the problem with the community, and I do apologise for the issues I'm having with my video camera by the way, I'm just going to go off and go on, I'm not quite sure why it is. Um, but it's a community that you have to conform to. It's [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2190s) a community that will accept you just as you are. It's a community where you have to be, as you said for it's, a good Brethren boy. And being a good Brethren boy means if you don't fit that mold, then it can't be your community, can it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2204s)

Absolutely, yeah. And obviously as a brother, you expect to take part in the meeting, you'll yeah, preach and the rest of it. And I found that absolutely terrifying whenever you go abroad to sort of visit my, um, auntie and uncle in Germany, you're expected that evening, you'll probably have to say something in the meeting and that, any times abroad were ruined because I'd have this dread getting to the meeting where again, you're being judged by people you don't know.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2228s)

I can fully relate. Yeah, there's always expected expectation and I hated that. And I think one of things when I came out was suddenly having this realisation that you're never going to ever have to preach again. And it was just like such a lovely feeling.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2246s)

Liberating, absolutely liberating.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2249s)

I always wanted to preach.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2252s)

No chance, Anne.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2255s)

I would have had loads to say.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2259s)

I think the last meeting I ever, ever, ever attended, I actually gave the hymn out at the end of the meeting. So that's really good. So Fritz, um, how long ago is it since you came, you you left the Brethren now?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2276s)

So I left in 2015, 7th of July 2015\. So, um, yeah, we're coming up almost eight years now, eight years. Yeah, generally didn't think I'd last this long. I remember trying to work out in my head during one of the meetings how long I'd last because obviously the rapture's coming and all rest of it. And I literally generally didn't think I'll get to 30\. It's ridiculous. But here we are, one year off. So...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2300s)

I was just gonna say in that, wondering how long you're gonna last. I don't know about you, but when I first left it was, you felt like you have to fit everything into a really short space of time. You have to get all these things done really quickly because you're never going to survive. You know, something's going to happen, you know, you're going to be punished in some way. And so it was like, yeah, it's strange. I've slowed down now, but it was like, for a long time it [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2330s) like, have to do this, have to do that, you know.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2332s)

Absolutely. And even the smaller things that's slightly related to that. Um, when I used to go shopping, I used to literally almost run around the shop to make sure we weren't part of, you know, rubbing shoulders of the world and the rest of it. And even now, Paul still has to tell me to slow down. You know, the world is not going to end anytime soon. You're going to be fine.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2352s)

The rapture won't come while you're in the shop. Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2354s)

Exactly, yeah. Well, you know, you'll be fine any day on Sunday, but yeah. So yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2362s)

I was going to ask, in those, I was going to switch my camera off. In those seven, eight years, how much contact have you been able to have with your immediate family?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2373s)

So the first few months it was, um, I had a fair bit of contact, I'd say. Um, it, and especially at the start, it was very, very warm, very loving. There wasn't any begging to come back or anything like that. Um, I remember, so we had one, I met my parents for coffee, um, couple of days after I left. Um, one of the first thing dad said was, I didn't realize you could cure it. Um, and he thought it was like, you're gay for life, but he, until he was told by someone else. Um, and...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2409s)

You mean cure being gay?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2411s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2411s)

Okay, okay, yeah. Oh right, so yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2414s)

He didn't realize. And I said, so I did ask, you know, what was, what was the help? And they weren't too sure, apart from it was, uh, educational help first.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2424s)

Do you think somebody in the Brethren had perhaps spoken to your dad and said, hey, we can cure Fritz of that? A bit like they did to you Ross about your therapy sessions?

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2432s)

I'll just share this with you Fritz, as you know, I had various addictions and the local Brethren thought that me going to AA meetings would turn me straight.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2443s)

Oh wow, that's new one. Wow, yeah, no, it's, it, we, I did have a priest turn up at my door once where I lived and I lived on my own. Um, stupidly didn't check who it was before I opened the door and he was stood there. Um, and he, yeah, again, he, I asked him what the help was and he wouldn't tell me explicitly what, what it was. Um, and I questioned him about the separation thing then as well and he, that, he turned on a pin and he was absolutely livid that I'd even questioned it and he said, that's the first thing you all, um, question. And I said, I generally don't understand it because, you know, if you really have this genuine love and relationship with God, why don't you want to share it with others? Um, and there's a guy walking down the street at the time and he said, well, that guy, we don't know if he's a murderer or a rapist. And I was like, and that was his explanation. And yet they're harboring, um, child abusers and everything in there.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2501s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, exactly.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2503s)

Yeah. Um, so then since [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2505s), that Christmas of that year, I turned up my parents' house. Um, my brother, old brother opened the door because he wasn't in the meeting, he probably got home late or something. Um, he showed me around the house, family came home, they all hugged me. Um, we drank coffee and tea, we had something to eat, they asked me to play the piano for a bit if they wanted to hear it again.

And it was very much suddenly, for a brief moment in time, it was all cut back to normal, just for a little bit.

They all talked to me like I was just like they'd always talked to me. And then obviously when the time came for me to go, mum burst into tears. And that was the last time I had proper contact with anyone really, a proper sort of, you know, social contact. Um, eventually they, so they turned up my door once to tell me that I've been shut up the night before. That was when they were really cold. They did, there were, there's no, no hugs from that point onwards. Um, and then I got a [letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2567s) from, um, my dad and the two priests telling me I've been withdrawn from. Um, and they got mum to write out the letter and send it, which I was, it made me feel physically sick because I knew that that would have an impact on mum. Having to send that letter to your own son that you're withdrawn from is just...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2588s)

That's actually really cowardly isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2590s)

Yeah, it is.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2592s)

I mean, that actually makes me feel quite angry because... Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, A, they don't generally get women involved in anything priestly wise anyway, and then to use your own mother to write that letter. Yeah, that's just awful.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2611s)

Yeah, it makes me really angry that they use the ones that you're closest to. Yeah, absolutely. They knew that. It wouldn't have been the same if Dad sent it or one of the priests, it wouldn't have the same impact. But...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2624s)

No, but for her as well, do you think for her they would have, yeah, but do you think they would have done that sort of to make her feel, yeah, yeah, feel like she had to cut you off?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2638s)

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, because I know she's not been well since. Um, not physically, uh, but she has struggled, she has told me that. Um, and you know, a lot, you get, I get a lot of guilt and shame from that. It's, you know, it's, that's natural feel that from when you think you've hurt your mum. Um, but yeah, I know a lot of that is also, well, 98% of that is also the Brethren. It's not, it's not my doing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2666s)

All of it then, the guilt is not yours. You're not the person that's cut her off.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2676s)

I, I think it's such an easy way to feel like that, but I think the, the answer is, if your mum came and knocked on your front door tomorrow, what would you do? You know, you haven't cut her off. You, you would put the kettle on for her, wouldn't you? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2691s)

Yeah, yeah, and it's that, that's, it's been since then it's, um, first couple of years, there was no birthday things. I used to send them cards and gifts and I still turned up at the door and eventually asked me to stop turning up or sending gifts. They said it was too painful for them, which is fair enough. I understand that completely. It goes both ways.

And then it kind of went down to sort of emails, but you're not really sure if they would see them, if they didn't get, if you didn't get response. Now I use WhatsApp. Little bit easier to send messages. Um, and but again, it's very much, um, me checking in to ask how they are, "we're fine, thanks."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2734s)

Yeah, this is another thing I, I find about contact with the Brethren. Um, I was told once by the Brethren, loads of people that have left the Brethren have contact with their family, but the contact is always on their terms, isn't it? Always on their terms and it's always us ex-members thinking, well, I better not say that because I'll upset them and I better keep the subjects to this and this so I don't upset them. And even to [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2764s) point where the contact I've had with my brother, he doesn't even ask how I am. Not just a general how are you. It's completely on their terms and that's just, yeah, says it all really, doesn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2779s)

Yeah. It's, it's very much reduced to, yeah, pretty much nothing now. And I mean, I sent, um, a Mother's Day message yesterday but got a very short message back. Um, but again, I know it's, that's not mum, you know, it's, I always know. I always understand that's not mum. Um, yeah, and I know in the back of the head, I still remember that, you know, I have all these other memories to make sure that I keep, keeps myself, my head above water. Um, because it is difficult, because when you know, it does feel very personal, doesn't it? Especially when it becomes your own mother and you were so close.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2817s)

For you mum, how do you cope with that now, you know, the loss of her?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2821s)

Um, it's a continual struggle really. I think it was obviously a lot more difficult to start off with. Yeah. [Um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2826s), but as time goes on, you, you know, I've had therapy as well and, um, you build up a new network and it certainly doesn't fill the gaps that's been left. Um, but it does help to, help you move forward. I mean, there's so many others, you know, so many more new friends and family that we, I've got and Paul's got four children and they've all, they've all included me as, as a family member. Um, and I really feel like, you know, when we have Christmases and family dinners together now, I feel like a part of the family, like I did back then. It usually takes me a while to thaw out, but with them now, it's just like, like it's normal. 

Um, my, so Paul's dad is, he is, um, getting on near 90 now. He's a very particularly blunt and no nonsense type of guy. Um, but even he now introduces us to his visitors and carers as his sons. Um, and that was the big thing because he was, [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2885s) was very much, you know, from that generation where it's, he's just very blunt and you know, yeah, even he, he can, he can, even he can love me. So, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2895s)

My partner's mum is exactly the same. She, she always refers to me as her son, um, to anybody she meets. Um, um, yeah, it's really lovely that you've got that. It really is.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2906s)

Absolutely, and...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2908s)

I, I think that's what a lot of ex-Brethren would do, isn't it? We, we, we find, if you like, another family. And another, you've found Paul and, um, Ross has found his partner and we all have. And then you get, it doesn't replace that family you've lost. It doesn't replace, but it fills that hole. And it's, I, I don't think, the saddest thing I think is the families that are in there are hurting too. I'm sure your mum hurts.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2935s)

Oh, absolutely, I'm sure she does.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2937s)

And I'm sure Ross's mum hurts and our immediate, from Anne's children will hurt and Ross's parents will hurt, but they can't do anything about it. The control that is holding them, they can't do anything about it. So they end up having to believe that we're whatever they want to believe, bitter or wicked or whatever they want to believe, to try and make themselves feel comfortable in the environment they find them in. And it's just so sad and it's just so wrong, isn't it? Yeah, [um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2967s).

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2967s)

And I think, I think sometimes that's why they can't cope with seeing us. Like, yes, that it was too painful. I think because they're trying to paint this picture of this awful person, yet when they meet you, you're still you. You're still, they can't put those two things together. So in their minds, they just have to separate it all.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=2990s)

Absolutely. I think that's one thing when I turned up at the door and we had a genuine chat, I wasn't, you know, it was, I would ask how they've been doing, I'd tell them about work, you know, and it was all very normal. I think that kind of put them off. They were like, yeah, you suddenly have horns or something. I don't know, but it's, it's, yeah, yeah, you're just like the same person who left, you know, left the home. Yet we're meant to be thinking of you as this person who's on this slippery slope. Um...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3016s)

Yeah. I remember my, I remember mom saying on the phone shortly after I left, she said, I can't understand it because you just still sound like Anne. But then when I see you, I can't cope with it because you don't look the same, but you still sound the same, you're still talking about the same things, you know. It's really difficult for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3041s)

It is difficult for them. And I think too, as you say Fritz, you talk to your family and you're still the Fritz who was part of their family that they know. Um, and that actually, they say upsetting, but actually I think it completely unsettles them because then they start to think, well, okay, this person has different, a different life, but he's still the same person we know. And if they start to question that, how you can still be the same Fritz they know and love, [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3071s) they're going to start to question so much more and they cannot afford to do that. The consequences of going down that road is they'll end up where we all are.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3080s)

Yeah, exactly. They're basically just frightened to go down that rabbit hole, aren't they?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3086s)

Yes, they are. So they protect themselves. And then I also think, Fritz, you referred to your mum not looking terribly well when you last saw her. I also think continually not going down that rabbit hole that you can end up, I mean, I'm saying this partly from my own experience, I know it's many years ago, I've been in the Brethren with this huge dissonance because you see people and you think, well actually, there's nothing wrong with them, but I have to believe there's something wrong with them. So you're continually trying to draw that there must be something wrong with them, there must, because [I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3116s) in this special place.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3117s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3118s)

And I think that's why they end up, a lot of them can end up with this huge mental conflict. I know I did when I was in, but luckily I left when I was very young. But I think if I'd stayed, it would have got worse, that mental conflict. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3133s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3135s)

So go on Fritz, go on.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3137s)

I know, I just, I really wanted to quickly mention as well, um, when I first started looking at getting out, um, I went on the wicked PBCC page at the time, had a little help button, um, and I emailed someone on there, um, obviously anonymous, and they got me to get in touch with the, another guy who left who's gay. And I remember the first thing he said to me, um, we sat in our, sat in the car park thinking, God, this is, well, probably not God, but this is the first step of a very, very slippery slope. Um, and [our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3167s) first thing he said to me was, Fritz, you need to realize that everyone out here is not how you've been taught. It was, it was something that I already kind of started seeing, but it was the light bulb moment that I needed. 

Yep. And it's something I know other people have mentioned as well in the podcast as well, that you need to realize that people out here are out to help you, hold you up. You know, that I went to the barber's about three days after I left. He asked me what haircut I wanted. I said, I had no idea. Um, it wasn't this. Um, and he, yeah, and so I started telling my story and they said, this is why I don't know how to have my hair, which sounds ridiculous. Yeah, it was mine.

 But we then had, you know, we kept in contact for over the years and then the barber down the road now, [she's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3211s), she was in touch with me about the whole BBC thing that I did and she was, you know, being really much of a, quite a cheerleader and lots of people, people at work and people that you come across like recruitment consultants getting your job and they've been really supportive. People are always out here to hold you up. Yes, of course there are bad people, but yeah, they're everywhere. The majority, yeah, the majority are here, all here to help you and accept you for who you are. Doesn't matter what you can do for them or what you can say for them. They're accepting for just for being you.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3240s)

Because that's the thing isn't it? The Brethren teach you that um, everybody out here if they do something for you they want something in return. And it's not at all. There are a lot of people out here that will help you just because they want to help you and they don't expect anything in return at all.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3259s)

Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3260s)

Yeah, and Fritz, you mentioned, um, when you were younger with your mum that you used to make cakes with her. Did I hear that right earlier when you were talking?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3270s)

Yeah, so we've grown into a little thing, little thing that's happened. Um, so yeah, so I, so it all started really. I always used to love baking, um, kind of obviously sort of thing we used to do with mum with a little one. Um, in year 12, we were all meant to be doing an A-level English course or something and everyone dropped out apart from me and two girls. And, um, they said, I'll just do a project. So we started up a cupcake business, or business, a product, cupcake project, um, where we researched, we built a brand and we made cupcakes and [sold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3304s) them to the restaurant and that kind of thing. And, um, I remember what a guy coming in from the Brethren businesses, one of their suppliers, and he just showing us how to pipe. And, um, he, I remember him saying, oh, you've got quite a natural hand at that. And I was like, oh, okay, whatever, you know, probably as a male, I probably shouldn't have. 

But, um, and then so, yeah, so I went on to make cakes for mums, so Mother's Day, birthdays, that kind of thing. And then my sister, um, especially the last, I think two years before [the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3335s), two years before I left, both years I made, um, cakes for her and then my grandma. Um, and it came a bit of a, bit of a thing, I suppose. Um, and obviously all of a sudden it stopped when I left. And then just started up again just with obviously for Paul and his family and that kind of thing. And then a friend and colleague at the time, she asked me to do her wedding cake, which is terrifying because I was also a guest. So this cake was sat staring at me for most of the evening, threatening to sweat and, you know, fall apart and the rest of it. But it was a massive success. It was brilliant. And it literally, it's snowballed from there basically. It's still very much a hobby. 

Um, and, but I just, I love the feeling that all the, the, yeah, the feeling I get from seeing people's joy when they see the cake and how much time and care I've put into it. [It's,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3390s) um, that's why on my Instagram, I have the hashtag \#thatcakefeeling because it's not just about the eating, which, you know, is quite nice, but also it's the memory you have and the fact that someone actually cared enough to make it for you. Um, yeah, so it started from there and it's just taken off really.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3410s)

Can we show some photos?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3415s)

Yeah, please do share the screen Anne. You sent us some photos so we thought we'd share them because they really are amazing Fritz.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3423s)

Very much self-taught, so it's all been a learning curve.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3427s)

They are amazing, but it's a talent because you must have the imagination, then the gift to actually put the cake together.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3433s)

And so they're all, they're always personalized. I don't like getting someone, well, I've had a few people sort of say, can you make this for me? Um, I had a wedding last year, which one of the photos will be, where it's, um, Van Gogh's Starry Night on a cake. They asked me to paint it on a cake, which I had so many moments where I was nearly going to say no to them. Um, and also we had the heat, heat wave last year, so we were 36 degree heat and we were also at that wedding as well. So that was, but the case is good, which is good. Yes, so yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's just...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3467s)

Oh, why can I not do this?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3470s)

Um, and if you give me a minute, I'll go back on to, I've had to switch to my phone, but I'll go back onto my computer and try and do it. So Fritz, are you happy to keep talking and I'll switch back to my computer?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3480s)

Yeah, yeah, tell us about how you made the case, because I think, yeah, so I, so at the moment it's very much family and friends. Um, they sort of hit, but yeah, so it's done by word of mouth. Um, and they just give me ideas of what they're looking for. I usually sort of, you know, favorite color, all the rest of it. And then I just spend some time just coming up with an idea that's going to be personal to them. Um, and something that's, you're not going to find on the internet. Um, and as I say, it's very much a learning curve. Recently I started, found out you can make edible moss, which I didn't read as a thing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3518s)

Okay.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3518s)

And mushrooms, that was another thing. And then obviously this cake that I painted with Van Gogh's paint, painting on it, that was, you have to make a special type of buttercream to be able to paint like on a cake because obviously it doesn't have the same consistency as acrylic paint. Um, and it's all done with a palette knife that took about five, four or five hours to paint it on. Um, yeah, and we had to take it up to somewhere up north, so it was a treacherous, hard journey [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3548s) this cake wobbling around the back.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3553s)

And do you sort of plan it all out? Like, do you draw it all before you actually do it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3558s)

I usually have a drawing of it, yeah. Um, some things I leave to sort of see what happens. Um, and usually it works out fine, so you know, that's, that's a good thing. But, um, yeah, usually it's a, I've drawn out and I just Google everything. You know, when she said I want moss in a cake, I said, can you make edible moss? And it came up with the character to make edible moss. It's just that...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3579s)

You make that moss then?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3582s)

Yeah, it's, yeah, it's very much, it's almost like a consistency of a really loose sponge texture, right? And you literally mix eggs with, um, a sort of flour and sugar and, um, food coloring obviously, because it's bright green. Um, and then you, you microwave it for a minute in these disposable cups and you cut it out and it's just like...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3607s)

Absolutely, that's incredible. I thought that like edible moss, you must have just bought it somewhere.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3613s)

Yeah, so literally it's absolutely bizarre, but just shows that you can make anything.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3618s)

Yeah, that is amazing. You've, when you're doing the designs, do you come up with the designs mainly because you're obviously able to put so much together and it tells a story?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3634s)

Yeah, absolutely, yeah. So it's sometimes, so I said it's the wedding cake last year that was, she gave me a picture and said, I want this. Um, and then I think I've only had one other person for a child's cake who said, you know, this is what my son wants.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3648s)

Oh, there we go. Can you see it now?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3653s)

Yeah, so this was amazing, yeah. So this was the first, uh, this is the cake that all blew it up. So hence why it's part of my logo now. Um, so they are, they're beer lovers and festival lovers, so you can't really see it in that picture, but around the, the other side from the cake, sorry, the flowers, they are all miniature beer glasses and beer cans.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3673s)

I think you can just, can you just see them on the left of the pictures there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, fantastic, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3682s)

Yeah, yeah, I can see it, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3683s)

And then we've got this one here.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3688s)

There's obviously a reference to Doctor Who, which I didn't have a clue at the time.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3692s)

What's that, yeah, connection? I mean, I obviously realized it was Doctor Who, but yeah, that's, yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3700s)

So she's a very much a Doctor Who nerd, so, um, that's what that was.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3703s)

And then we've got this one here.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3705s)

So yeah, this was the one that appeared on the BBC thing. Um, so yeah, this is just a friend's 40th birthday cake. It was a weird mix of wanting it to look classy, but also Halloween. So we had leopard print and edible bats and that kind of thing. And the bottle is a reference to one of her favourite musicals is Wicked. I think it's Wicked. Where there's something about a green bottle. I don't know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3734s)

They all dress up as green bottles. I have seen it many years ago. Something like that.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3738s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3741s)

How long does it take you to do this?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3744s)

So it will be a good day and a half probably. It's also obviously I do it around my full-time work. So I do make the sponges, then coat like, paint, sorry, ice it and then put the decorations on. So this is the, this is the edible moss.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3760s)

Amazing. It's amazing.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3764s)

So, yeah. All the mushrooms are handmade from like model, modeling fondant looking for pictures and then I had a airbrushing tool. Um, and the horns are from, so this, the, the this cake was for a friend who's 25th birthday. She's a pagan, um, all the sort of Norse gods and that kind of thing. So the horns are for like Loki, the god, Norse god. Yeah, it's actually a very much a Hollywood thing, but apparently she likes it, so it's fine. And then around the back of it, you can't really see it, but on the, from the 25 running down the back, there's this like a river of, um, gold love hearts and that's to represent Freya, the god of love. So, and she's in pictures, she's always got long sort of golden auburn hair, so that'll sort of represent that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3816s)

Yeah, they are absolutely amazing. And Fritz, out of interest, I mean, you've obviously got a real talent for this. Would this, you do it alongside your full-time work now, but if you'd carried on with this among the Brethren, would it have been acceptable for you as a guy to expand this and sell it as a business? Would that have been an acceptable work for you in the Brethren?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3840s)

No, no, absolutely not. I mean, if it was a, if it was something that they could turn into a, you know, a, um, something creating factories and create high numbers of sales from and I wasn't involved in it, then yes, it would be a business. Um, but for me to have my little bakery down the road and little community and have, you know, these little, little cake shop, that would have been unheard of. 

Um, one of the things weirdly, I had my dad spoke to me before I left and he could tell something was up because I was very quiet and obviously, you know, trying to work my head around this whole new thing that was about to happen. He sort of said, oh, you know, what about if we put you on like a course, like a cooking course or something? And that was quite revolutionary because, you know, men don't go on cooking courses, especially when they're near marriage age. They have a, you know, have a wife to do that sort of thing. So, yeah, I think then they probably possibly thought that something might be up and offered me something that I would, would, they knew I would enjoy. But no, I wouldn't have been a baker and that wouldn't have been a thing.

There's been times where there's initiatives that they ran where some of the brothers would do like meals and stuff like that, but by the time they got married, that that business was, had gone because they would obviously have to focus on family life and that kind of thing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3922s)

So this again comes down to the other factor where within that community, you can't be who you want to be because regardless of your sexuality, if a guy wanted to become a baker or a hairdresser, which many guys do, it would not have been acceptable, would it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3939s)

Oh yeah, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3941s)

It was shaking her head too. I mean, so again, it's restricting people's choices and people's, you know, what they can do in life and therefore the things that their natural personalities may be suited to and they can end up being forced down the road that's just not for them.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3957s)

Absolutely. The career paths are so restricted. You're sales, marketing, accounts, you know, or, um, possibly in the warehouse. And that was, that was all you've got. You've, you, so I spent the last four years recently working in a school was a teaching assistant, um, working alongside one-to-one with a student and that was one of the most rewarding careers I've ever had. 

Um, incredibly rewarding to see this, this boy grow up and, um, get [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=3987s) all this trauma he had and be part of his progress and it was absolutely amazing. But that would have never been a option at the present, you know, working or there's not a chance. Um, and yeah, so I, and I never fitted in those roles that they had. Um, one of the courses, one of the like management courses that they had when they started bringing out, I, I, um, started a sales and marketing course. I can't think what it was called now, but, um, but I didn't finish it. I didn't even get further past the first page. I found it so dull. Um, and there's no passion, that absolutely no passion at all.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4021s)

Yeah, I remember, um, yeah, what you're saying brings me back to my daughter saying to me when she was still living with me, she said, um, mum, I'd really love to join the army or be a, um, be an ambulance driver. Yeah, you know, she was really passionate about it. And I said, well, you know, if you stay where you are, you won't be able to do that. And she said, oh, do you think they'd let me drive a forklift truck or something in a warehouse? Because the last thing I want is to go in an office, sit in an office. Sadly, that's where she did end up, was sitting in an office.

So presumably at the schools, when you're at that 16 to 18 age when you're sort of thinking about what you want to do, you don't really think about what you want to do because there isn't a whole avenue of choice in front of you.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4076s)

No, the only kind of obvious option for me was marketing because I could do designing leaflets and that kind of thing, but even then that became a waste of time because you're spending time doing all these leaflets, you're not actually creating sales. Um, and it's all, it's all sales driven. It's all numbers. Of course it is, because it's a sales company. Yeah, but that just, I didn't have the gift of the gab. They've sent me on courses for telesales. I was terrified of it. I had to eventually quit. So I just wasn't, it wasn't me. Um, but [weirdly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4107s) now I work in recruitment and I do outbound calls all the time. It doesn't bother me. Um, but it's, I think it's because I myself now, I've got confidence, I can, you know, um, rather than then, I was this little quivering wreck that wouldn't, you know, didn't feel I had any worth anyway. So then to speak to someone out in this wicked world to try sell them something just wasn't going to work, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4129s)

No, yeah, yeah, no. Well Fritz, thank you so much for coming on and telling us your story. We really appreciate it. And I want to ask you a question that we actually asked, um, Ross when he came on. If there was somebody in the Brethren who is gay, what would you say to them?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4149s)

Well, I had a little bit written down for this already. So, yes, I, I actually did this and I also did the BBC piece. I did it for all the little Fritzes still inside. Yeah. You might feel worthless, you might feel like there's no way out. You might feel like you're a nobody trapped in a mental prison. Um, you might feel like you have nothing in yourself that could possibly hold you through such a dramatic transition. Um, I'm telling you now, you have got it. There are people out here that support you with no expectation return and there are people out here who become dear friends that will hold you up in your darkest hours, celebrate you for you and just enjoy your presence.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4192s)

Yeah, that's beautiful. That's really lovely, really lovely.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4197s)

I just have just an extra bit in case anyone else is watching inside there. Um, my blood family, I obviously miss them a huge amount still. It's been almost seven and a half years, but it doesn't, doesn't make any difference. I've trained, I've changed, it's true. I've got less hair on my head, more hair on my chin and more gray hair pretty much everywhere. So I've got confidence and self-love and knowledge of the actual truth. Um, I just want to be able to speak to my [mum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4227s) and I want to be able to speak to my family. Um, yesterday was Mother's Day. The run-up in the shops is incessant. The constant emails promoting it is draining. I loved celebrating mum. We did gifts organized, we, sorry, we did cakes, we organized gifts and meals. I apologize for the time you support your steam iron. Um, but I wish I could just celebrate Mother's Day, even just with a simple call.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4251s)

And I think that's something I would say to the Brethren, particularly the people that run the show, with all of the ex-Brethren, that's actually all we want, isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4260s)

Yeah, we're not...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4262s)

there to pull their church apart. We're not there to change their beliefs. Um, we're not even there to stop their meetings. We're not even there to take away their charitable status, but they need to start acting charitable.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4273s)

Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4274s)

It's all we want is to be able to have a relationship with our families. And we wouldn't be doing these podcasts probably if that was the case, because that's the bottom line, isn't it?

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4285s)

Yeah, and it's, yeah, as you say, it's, it's not like we want to have, you know, I'm not expecting to come around to my house and have dinner with me. No, that's, that's not, I know I'm trying to be realistic. I just, literally all I want is even just a response, a proper response to messages.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4299s)

Yeah, just to be able to have a chat, a meaningful chat without any inhibitions. Just have a normal conversation. Yeah, like you used to with your parents or your children, Anne, or your, your family, Ross, whoever it is. Just a normal conversation without those, that, that invisible wall that's always there now. Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4319s)

And also, I think with the family, especially, not just parents, but the family, I'm, I'm not going to be out to try and trick you into leaving this. That's not, it's not my role, no. And I think that's partly when I, when I came out, I was always a bit wary of the other outsiders. I thought, you know, they're all, they're all bitter and they're all out to get us and the rest of it. Yeah, yeah, but it actually, you know what, we, we just want to have a chat with you. It's, and it's nothing to try and persuade you to do anything. It's literally just have to find out how you are. No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4345s)

Yeah, and just to say, I'm still your son, I'm still Fritz, I'm still your mom, I'm still Ross, I'm still Anne. Yeah, and um, yeah, and it's quite interesting because I know that that's one thing that's been said about me in the Brethren is that I try and persuade people to leave, that I break up families. And I know that's been said about me and you, you think, how can you even try and dissuade? That's the last thing in the world you, I think most ex-Brethren would never persuade someone to leave because we all know how hard [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4375s) is.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4378s)

No, it's not our decision to make, is it?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4379s)

It's not our decision to make, no, no. Um, and...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4383s)

It's a very, it's a very serious decision to make, yes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4386s)

Absolutely, yeah.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4388s)

All we can do is help those that have made the decision.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4390s)

Yeah. I think, um, sorry Ross.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4393s)

Yeah, no, I was gonna say all we can do is help those that are thinking of leaving to perhaps make that leap to actually leave. Yeah.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4402s)

Yeah. I think what Anne said on your podcast about with Cheryl, Cheryl, about having that landing pad, that that was very much an aha moment for me because I sort of say, you know, Paul keeps telling me that you've actually created a little pathway for other little people, other people that might want [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4420s) leave. You know, you've just created this little space where they can come and knock on the door and you'll be happy to say, come in and just have a cup of tea. It's, you know, and that's why I think it's very...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4430s)

it's very important and I think it's really good that people like yourself and Ross and Ben have come and spoken on the podcast because we know that there are people in there who are gay and keeping that secret to themselves. And if they can see there's three people speaking openly about their struggle to leave and the effect it had on them, but hey, they're okay, they're doing it.

### [**Ross Turner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4450s)

Right, you know, statistically one in ten people are gay, so there must be a whole lot of them in there.

### [**Fritz Penny**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4456s)

Yeah. Well I know that...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4458s)

the, the pod, the Get-A-Life, um, Get-A-Life team have been contacted by people in there again since Ben Woodbury's podcast went out and I can imagine after your two podcasts, there will be more contact as well because hopefully it will give those people the confidence to think, hey, I don't have to fight this on all on my own and keep this what they perceive a dark, dirty secret, which it isn't, but they perceive it that way when they're in, don't they? And they can just not, not have to live like that. So yeah, [Fritz,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4489s) thank you so much. We thoroughly appreciate your time and your cakes are wonderful.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4497s)

Might order one one day, yeah, yeah.

### [**Ross Atmore**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4501s)

Joe and I will get one, you to make us one for our wedding, yeah. You've got an order out of it already, go for it. Yeah, yeah, all right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4506s)

Thanks.

### [**Get-A-Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zERlgi_ITKs&t=4513s)

## Note on Terminology

Throughout this transcript, references to the "Brethren," "Exclusive Brethren," or "PBCC" refer specifically to the group now formally known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). This sect is part of the wider "Plymouth Brethren" movement.

Despite the historic ambiguity around the sect's name, it can clearly be distinguished from any other "Brethren" group by its unbroken line of leadership succession, as follows:

*   John Nelson Darby (1848–1882) – Seized exclusive control following the 1848 split
*   Frederick Edward Raven (1882–1903)
*   James Taylor Sr. (1903–1953)
*   James Taylor Jr. (1953–1970)
*   James H. Symington (1970–1987)
*   John S. Hales (1987–2002)
*   Bruce D. Hales (2002–present)


## Note on PBCC-Linked Organizations
