Hello everyone, welcome back to Get-A-Life, Ex-Cult Conversations. We have some new people that have been added to our team to help us out. And we are going to introduce you to some ladies from the UK that are going to also bring in some stories from overseas. So take it away, ladies.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=35s)

Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Get-A-Life podcast from the UK. I'm here with my friends Anne Hamilton, who you've seen on the podcast before, and also Ros Atmore, who you've also seen on the Get-A-Life podcast before, and our old friend Carman Drever, who's done many of these podcasts before. So today we got a special guest with us and I'll leave it to Ros to introduce our guest.

### **Ros Atmore**

Hello everyone, um, and our special guest tonight is John Spinks.

### [**Multiple Speakers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=72s)

Hi John. Hello. Hello John.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=77s)

What's this all about?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=83s)

Didn't you used to belong to the Exclusive Brethren or something?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=86s)

I did. It's in the past. I've forgotten all about it.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=89s)

Ah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=90s)

We need your memory tonight. So John, we've asked you on because you've written a very good book called *Cult Escape*, which I think most of us on here have read. Um, so I just wondered if you'd mind telling us what led up to writing that book, how you left the Brethren.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=112s)

Yeah, sure. Yeah, well, I was born into the Exclusive Brethren in 1966 and for the next 22 years, it was my normal life. Um, very unusual compared to my friends at school and most people in this good world, but, um, yeah, 11 meetings a week was the norm. Um, and controlled by [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=142s) many laws and rules and regulations. Um, religious groups that control people are on a continuum of how much they control, and some are called high-demand groups, maybe you can get mid-demand groups, but the Exclusive Brethren was a high-demand group. And so our lives were controlled, um, I would say 95 percent.

I would say that the suicide cults, they control people's lives 100%, so I'd say this is, in my opinion, 95 percent. And so, um, my life was controlled: where I couldn't go, where I couldn't eat, where I couldn't sleep, um, what length I couldn't cut my hair, um, who I couldn't marry, um, what type of house I couldn't live in, what drains couldn't be shared with the neighbors, a whole host of rules and regulations that completely controlled me. And of course, [growing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=195s) up it was all I knew, and so it was the norm. But I got to the age of 18 and I was driving, and I was able to get out a bit more than I had been. And I started seeing things and seeing, meeting people and and realizing that they're not sort of evil monsters that I've been brought up to believe, that there's a lot of love in this world. And I started desiring the wicked things like [football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=226s) matches and restaurants and good music, things which I'd been brought up to believe were of the devil and wicked.

And over the period of the next four years, I started to realize how utterly boring these 11 meetings were to me, and I wanted to be out in the fresh air experiencing, you know, the normal things in life. And it got to a point whereby I felt I was a rope in a tug of war because it was impossible for me to leave, because it would mean potentially never seeing my parents again, who I loved, and love. But on the other side of the [rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=265s) was the bright lights of the city of which I'd been told was so evil and wicked, and yet the sheer boredom was driving a wedge. And when I was 22, it was on my birthday actually, I was looking out my bedroom window feeling down and I saw these two drunks walking by below and I thought, "They're having a life and I'm not." And in that moment, I realized in 10 years' time I was going to be 32\. I was good at maths. And I [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=295s) going to have 10 years of misery, guaranteed, yeah, just like I'd been having over the previous four years. And there's only one person that could do anything about it.

 I hadn't told anybody how I'd been feeling in those four years, and that one person, of course, was me. And I said, "That's it. I am out of here." And with that in my mind, I left. It took me 100 days to get accommodation, to get a phone line in for a business, and to transfer my life over. And after the 100 days, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=325s) left. And because I couldn't just walk away from my parents, it was just too painful, I made up a little lie and I said I'd been with a woman, shock horror. And so my dad told the priests, and they had a meeting that night. And Dad phoned me up the next day with the news that they'd only shut me up. And I thought, "Oh no, you know, that didn't work." So I said, "Well, actually, it was more than one woman." And so he went back to the priests and they had the next meeting. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=357s) I was sitting there watching my television one evening, and the priest, Raymond T from Liverpool, he phoned me up in the evening. He was disturbing me actually because I was watching the football, Liverpool versus Arsenal, the semi-final of the League Cup, which is very dangerous, yeah. And he said, "We had the meeting and we've withdrawn from you." And I said, "I'm just busy at the moment, I've got to go, goodbye." And that was the last I heard from them. And so, yeah, so that was how, that was the moment, the epiphany moment which got me out of [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=392s) four years of torment, really. It got me off the fence. It was the realization that I was heading for, you know, a life of misery and I decided to do something about it.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=402s)

So you say, this is quite interesting because I'm thinking of, um, people inside that might be considering to make that move you took when you were 22\. And they might have that light bulb moment that you had when you saw those two drunks and think, "The life I've got is not the life I want, and I don't want to be in 10 years." But then you've got to execute that decision. Did you actively plan how to do it? Was it a conscious plan? [Because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=432s) sometimes when you leave, it gets sprung on you. Some people are able to actively plan, it's different. Did you actively then set about making an almost calculated, but I mean that in a good way, plan to leave?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=447s)

Yes, I did. Um, from that moment, um, I realized, looking back, my values shifted and my value for freedom became more important than a life of misery. And so, yeah, to do that, I had to get my accommodation. Of course, I didn't want to be living on the street. And I had a self-employed business at the time, so I had to get a phone line in. And, yeah, I was 22\. I knew nothing about the big bad world, or the big good world. And so I had to do it myself. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=478s) didn't have the internet, no. I didn't have a mobile phone or a computer, whereas today there's lots of resources and lots of stories of people who have left. And if you're watching this and you are bored shitless, excuse the language, then you might be pondering, you know, how on earth could you get out. Well, you know what? It's easy. 

The hardest bit is the emotional bit of leaving everybody you know behind. But you've got to come to terms with that and you've got to make a [decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=508s), you know, what you're going to do. Are you going to be a slave? Are you going to allow yourself to be controlled? Is that loving yourself? Are they loving you? Or are you going to pursue freedom and go for it? And so, yeah, there's lots of resources out there. And when I, you mentioned the book, when I turned 50, I know you're amazed how I could look so young.

### [**Multiple Speakers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=534s)

Has that happened yet, John? You did say you were born in '66, so yeah, we'd already worked it out.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=547s)

This is what happens, you see, when you leave, when you pursue freedom, you know, it takes years off you. I recommend it. Yeah, about six or seven years ago, I woke up one morning and I thought, "I'm free." I've been free for maybe 30 years. And it's okay for me, but there are people there who are trapped in religious cults, people who are between a rock and hard place, people who are terrified of losing their family, their husbands, their wives, their children, their grandparents, etc. And [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=577s) thought, if I don't write the story, I'll feel a bit mean. And so I decided to write it. And it took me three years to write this book, *Cult Escape*, which, I'm not actually plugging it, you don't have to buy it because you can get it free on Amazon Unlimited as an ebook or it's on YouTube, maybe the link will be below later, where I've recorded the chapters on YouTube so you can listen to that free if you want to. And as I was writing the book, I realized that...

I realized that the main problem with the Exclusive Brethren and with religious cults...

There's many problems, but the main one is that they destroy families. If people want to wear silly hats and go to meetings and, um, not go to restaurants and not even have a television, and if they want to live in such houses and cut gaps around the walls so they're separate from the neighbors, you know, if they want to have those sort of little peripheral things, that's their choice, isn't it? But, yeah, destroying families. Now, no, no, not that. You can't do that in society. But the trouble is that at the moment they can because it's [legal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=646s), isn't it, to coercively control people, which I know, Jacky, you're...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=650s)

You might get me on my soapbox, John.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=653s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=655s)

And it's interesting, isn't it? Because I think every one of us on this call has lost family, and some more than others. I mean, Anne, I know we all know your story. And all of us have lost family, either immediate or extended. And I've often asked myself, you kind of learn to live with that. But actually, John, you mentioned about, you loved your parents. So when you first left, how did you cope with that?

You know, effectively turning your back on two people who... I mean, it's quite an emotional subject, but I know you touched on it in your book. How did you cope with that in those early days of leaving?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=692s)

Well, I'll tell you what happened. I wrote this in the book. On that morning of November the 7th, 1988, it was the most saddest moment of my life because I made my mother cry, and I'd never done that before. I love them. I went to my accommodation, I actually cried for three hours non-stop. And looking back and learning a bit of psychology, I realized that I went through what's known as the five stages of grief. I went through five [stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=722s) very quickly. The first one was... what's the first one? Blimey.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=731s)

I know there's grief, there's anger, there's denial, but I'm not sure...

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=737s)

Yes, I went into denial. I thought, "I can't believe I've done this. I can't believe this has actually happened. I do not believe that I'm sitting here and I have left my, I've left the past behind." And then it went into anger. And I thought, "How dare, how dare they separate, how dare they control my parents, to coercively control them into, they're not allowed to have anything to do with me, maybe for the rest of my life. How dare they." And then it went into blame, and I blamed them and I blamed myself. I went through that extreme emotion. And then it went into depression, [and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=768s) that was very bad, very low. And at the end of the depression, well at the end of the three hours, I remember thinking to myself, "You know what, I don't like this emotion. It's pretty crap. I'm going to go to the video shop and become a member and get some comedy videos." And I went and I got Laurel and Hardy and Fawlty Towers. I took them home, they made me laugh, and I've been laughing ever since.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=789s)

Yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=790s)

And so that actually is my, you know, maybe unusual way of handling that traumatic experience of coming to terms. But in the back of my mind, I also knew that there is a remote chance that they could come out of the Brethren sometime. And I sort of held on to that. Now, they didn't, they haven't done. My mum passed six years ago. My dad's still alive, so he might well one day, but that's up [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=820s) him.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=820s)

And how has, over the years, what has your contact with them been like?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=826s)

Well, there's a culture in the Brethren, they may not, they may deny this, but their culture is that they don't really have anything to do with the relatives, certainly not in a normal way. So for example, they wouldn't go shopping, they wouldn't go and eat with you, they wouldn't drink with you, they wouldn't invite you around, they wouldn't come around your house, they wouldn't share their birthdays, weddings and funerals. In fact, my aunt died a few months ago and I [wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=856s) told. I had, I found out by accident. And so they don't share their life with you. 

And so, but every six months, I sort of phone my dad up and ask him how he is, and my brother as well. So as I've said to them, my door is wide open for them anytime they want. I'm not, kind of, not closed. It's all on them. And so the culture is though, that they don't contact me, which is why my brother hasn't contacted me in, you know, 34 years, because they are controlled, coercively controlled [not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=886s) to, as we know.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=887s)

Yeah, and I think that's quite interesting because I think everyone here would agree with me, our door is never shut.

### [**Multiple Speakers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=895s)

No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=896s)

To our family. I mean, I know Anne, if your children contacted, your arms would be wide open. And I'm sure Roz, you've got family that you would feel exactly the same about. Um, it's not a case of us, there's always an accusation hurled at ex-leavers that you chose to leave. And the inference of that is when we chose to leave, we knew the consequences, but that doesn't make the consequences right, does it?

### **\[Multiple Speakers\]**

No. We [didn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=926s) make the rules, did we? No, we didn't. We didn't put them in place. We didn't choose, um, to abide by those rules. They did. Yeah, yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=937s)

It dawned on me as I was writing the book, and I wrote this down: it wasn't those who left who wanted the family split, it was those who remained, who remained and who remain there, who value the laws of their leader higher than their children and their husbands and their wives. Yeah. And so we don't, I did not want my family to be split at all, and I'm not split from them, as far as I'm concerned.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=962s)

Yeah, and it's interesting, isn't it? Because a lot of it is that insidious coercion that you've referred to, John, and I know that's something you've looked into. Um, perhaps you could tell us a bit more about that, the sort of group coercion that I know you and I both perceive to be a problem.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=983s)

Yeah, well, coercive control is illegal domestically, and since 2015, the government got the act together at last, yeah. But coercive control in groups is legal. And so anybody, if they've got enough, um, influence, can start up a group. They can, um, put the fear into people to control them. They can coercively control them. They can get them to sign their money over. If they die, their will over. Get them [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1013s) have nothing more to do with their children, husbands, or wives. And they can coercively control them with all the coercive rules which apply domestically. They can do that legally, and they can get away with it, which is what's happening today. And so what we're looking for, and I believe what will happen shortly, soon, well, what will happen soon is that coercive control will be illegal for religious groups. And then that's going to be very, very expensive for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1040s)

Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. Um, sorry, Anne, did you want to say something?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1045s)

No, no, I was just going to say it's almost more serious than the domestic coercive control because there's so many people affected, not just people within that group, but people like ourselves that, you know, it's caused so many casualties. Yes. Everywhere. It's not just within the group.

And yeah, the sooner, yeah, the sooner the law gets changed, the better. I have spoken, as you know, Jacky, I've spoken to my local MP, but it's sometimes like...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1082s)

It's very difficult. I mean, on that score, as you know, um, the charity called the Family Survival Trust, which I know you've had some dealings with, Anne, here in the UK have issued a full report about that and are calling for the government to change the law. So how they broke it down, which I thought was quite interesting, is the actual coercive behaviour is stipulated in law. And it's things like telling people who you can and can't be friends with, telling people [when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1112s) they can go out and when they can't go out, telling them where to live, taking their phones off them, restricting their money, all those things that are perceived as coercive behaviour, which I think we've all been subjected to from the circumstances we come from.

Um, and the result of that behavior happens in groups, and the Family Survival Trust are actually launching, um, a big campaign this year to try and get government to look at this and make it illegal from groups, not just religious groups, because there's sort of all sorts of groups, there's political groups and so on that pull people in and then they just find they can't get out and end up being cut off from family and so on. And if that law [change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1157s) went through, I think it will be very interesting results. Yeah, it'll be very interesting because it would basically make the sort of behavior that your parents, John, and all our families have been subject to, illegal.

And at the moment, if we wanted to do anything about it legally, it would be under the coercive control laws. It would be a case of you, John, having to take your father to court, which you're not going to do, are you? You're not going to do on a personal scale because you know it's not him, it's something outside of him that's controlling him to behave, you know, in the way he does towards you.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1201s)

Yeah, well, in the book, I've got a chapter on coercive control and there's 10 major points for the domestic coercive control. And when I was there, nine out of 10 of those were directly controlling my life. Yeah. And yeah, I'd like to say a little word to Bruce Hales, if you're watching right now.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1221s)

Go ahead.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1221s)

My dad and my brother, Bruce, have not been in touch with me much over these years, you know, over three decades actually. And you are responsible for coercively controlling them.

And I'm going to ask you right now to stop it. Stop what you're doing. If I was talking to Vladimir Putin, I'd say the same thing. Stop what you're doing. You're destroying families. You're killing them. You're not killing them like Putin is with bullets and with missiles and shells. You're killing them slowly because while they're alive, they're not allowed to see their loved ones, their children. You've got children, haven't you? How would you like it if someone [controlled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1267s) somebody whereby your children couldn't see you? How would you feel? Come on, Bruce, get a life.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1275s)

Thank you, John. You've echoed what a lot of us feel in saying that. Maybe we should say a collective amen.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1284s)

To that. Do you know, I could feel it rising. Yeah. I'm not sure that all our listeners would get that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1294s)

No, no. So perhaps we better explain that one. At the end of every preaching, we always had to say amen, didn't we? Is that right? It's a long time since I've been in a meeting. Some of you have been in a meeting more recently than me, but a Brethren meeting.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1309s)

Or when there was assembly discipline, you know, if there was anybody being shut up or anybody being withdrawn from, the whole room had to say amen to that, didn't they? Yeah. Gosh, yes, I've forgotten that one.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1321s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1322s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1323s)

Yeah, yeah, it is. So, have you had, what sort of reaction have you had to your book, John? Because, you know, we know the Brethren don't like having things publicized about their behavior and stories being told, but we also know that everybody has a right to tell their personal story. Nobody can stop you from doing that. And I know, Anne, you're working on a book as well. Yeah. Have you had any repercussions? Has anybody said anything?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1351s)

When I was writing it, I, I, um, put the book cover on the Facebook group, which I know the Brethren look at, yeah. And I was asking, "What do you think? Should I do this color, this color?" sort of thing. I think something like that. And so they got to know that I was writing a book, and I got three phone calls from the Brethren.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1371s)

Wow.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1372s)

And they said, "You must not publish that book." And I said to them, "Why not?" Because I'm only writing about the life that I was brought up in, yes, of which you were brought up in, which you agree with. You know, I know your Man of God turns corners and changes rules whereby one day you get kicked out and lose your family for having a mobile phone, but then 15 years later, the priests phone up people on their mobile phone. So we know [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1402s) that goes on. But the laws that I was under, you agree with them. And also, because I'm painting a picture of what goes on, then there may be people who read the book who may think, "Oh, I want to come into that coercive control," and maybe they'll join you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1425s)

And if you...

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1426s)

get members and they start donating, then you know, we can negotiate terms and conditions, make a commission maybe. And so, um, I was told three times not to. But since then, I haven't heard anything from them, except a few weeks ago. And that was that I phoned up my younger brother. He'll still love you, Stephen, always will. And I said, "Would you like to see my daughter?"

Uh, and he basically fudged it and said no, because my daughter has never been in the Exclusive, so she...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1462s)

was born out of the Brethren and has had a more balanced upbringing, I assume.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1467s)

Very different status in their eyes.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1469s)

Yes.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1470s)

And he said, um, I said...

That's right. And then he mentioned that my aunt had died two weeks before. And I said, "What?" I said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And he said, "Because you've written a book about us." And I said, "Yes, but a book about your rules. Well, you know, what's wrong with that? They're your rules." And he said, "It's very offensive." And I said, "How can it be offensive when I'm writing about the rules that your man of God put me under, which they put you under?" And he said, he actually said, "I never [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1507s) to speak to you again," which was sad to hear because he's never said anything like that before. 

And so he must have got to hear about the book. I don't—I doubt if he's read it. No. "If you want it, Steve, I'll send you a copy, no problem," I said. And in fact, when I had the phone call, the three phone calls when I was writing the book, I said, "Why? What are you ashamed of? Why don't you want the public to hear what goes on, [uh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1537s), in your group?" You know, I thought, "If you believe God is instructing your leader to tell you rules and regulations and laws and stipulations and how to, how to, uh, how to guide people's life," I would say they were controlled, "but why would you be ashamed of what your god and your man of god is trying to do?" And of course, they have no answers to that.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1562s)

No, because there isn't, there isn't an answer, is there?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1565s)

No, there isn't an answer. And I think, I mean, I don't know your brother, but I think sometimes the reasons why they don't want to speak to you is because you've just made them, you've hit the nail on the head and made them feel uncomfortable.

Yeah, yeah. And I've experienced a similar thing with my brother. Um, you know, if you, if you, they don't have the answers, so the easiest way is to say, "Well, I don't want to speak to you because you've written a book."

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1590s)

Yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like when you, when you put, when you put any article in the news or anything like that. Yeah. I remember the first one, you remember that one in *The Times*?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1600s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1601s)

And I got a phone call from my brother-in-law saying, "Oh, you know, you'll lose all contact." I said, "I've lost it anyway." Yeah. I can't lose any more than I've lost, you know. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1613s)

I mean, there's two things to that. A, it is very wrong to use family as emotional blackmail for what you do and don't do. I mean, that is frankly wrong, which is what they're doing essentially. Yeah. And secondly, um, with my brother, it was quite interesting because I left a long time ago and had nothing to do with Brethren or ex-Brethren or anything, and you still had no contact with us. So to say now, "I'm reluctant to talk to you [because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1643s) you speak out and everything and what you've done is very upsetting," um, same wording, actually, John, "is very upsetting," doesn't ring true because what about the 25 years before that when you never had any contact with me and I didn't speak a word? Yeah. So, um, I think it must make them feel uncomfortable. And I don't know if that's what you thought about your brother when you spoke to him recently, John.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1669s)

Yes, I mean, there's no communication. It's a one-way communication, you know. Um...

The only other real communication I have had was in, was it 2003, when there was what they call the review.

### [**Multiple Speakers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1686s)

Oh yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1687s)

And I got an astonishing phone call from my dad who said, um, he said, "John, um, John, Bruce Hales has told us that we have missed the spirit of the gospel and we could have been in contact with you all through these years."

"And we did not, uh, we misunderstood his father, who was John Hales, who was the Man of God before the current Bruce Hales." And I said, "Wow." I said, "So..." And he said he apologized. He said, "You know, we're repenting about it." So I said, "I'm going to come and see you then." He goes, "Yes."

And so I went around, um, and I saw my dad and mum and, um, it was mostly about the weather, you know. And uh...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1739s)

How long had it been since you'd seen them? In 2003, when was the last time you saw them before that?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1745s)

Uh, 1988\. So, 15 years.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1748s)

Wow.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1751s)

And so, it wasn't a deep conversation. But, and they weren't allowed to eat or drink with me in the room.

But they gave me something to eat and drink, I think. And once a month for six months, so six times, I went, and I took my daughter as well, who they had never seen.

She was their first grandchild and they weren't allowed to be there at the birth and celebrate her birthdays or even see her, such was the coercive control.

Incidentally, I was telling a lady about this who asked me, a grandmother, and she started crying. This was a lady I was working with. And I said, "Why are you crying?" She said because she knows that as a grandmother herself, for any grandmother not to see their grandchild and to hold their first grandchild is something of which, deep, deep down, it would be really upsetting. And she really felt for my mother and was, you know, weeping for her.

So anyway, um, so for six [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1817s), I went once a month. On the seventh time, my dad started saying, "Well, I'm busy," and, "shopping," etc., etc. And after about a few weeks of him knocking me back all the time, I said, "Hey, Dad, are you still allowed to see me?" To my amazement, he said, "No." I said, "What?" I said, "But you said that the Man of God said that you, that you missed the spirit of the gospel and that you'd misunderstood the matter of John [Hales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1847s)." And he said to me, "It was all just to try and make you come back."

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1852s)

Wow. So at least he was honest with his answer there.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1856s)

At least he was honest with me, yeah. He's a very honest man like that. And so he told me that. And I was quite amazed that that system can fall into that depravity of, you could say, winding people up, you know, getting children to see them. And of course, to say that it was something of which was a complete misunderstanding and all this crap about missing the spirit of the gospel [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1886s) good.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1886s)

It's emotional blackmail again. Yeah. I mean, it's the amount of people that were in hard times, in a bad state, and actually did go back because of it and then, you know, life goes awry and, "Well, we've got you now." So, Roz, presumably you were in at the time of the [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1916s)?

### **Ros Atmore**

Yeah, I was.

### **Jacky Hart**

Carman and I, and John obviously weren't, and we got contacted as well. So this was the whole motivation behind it, was it? So was it shortly after Bruce came into power?

### **Anne Hamilton**

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1926s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1926s)

Oh, it was massive. I mean, I remember, um, my in-laws...

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1932s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1935s)

He had a, my father-in-law had a sister who left in the '60s. Well, his parents had left in the [60s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1941s), but they had already died. But out of the blue, I mean, she hadn't seen her brother or anything to do with him for 40 years or 30-something years. Suddenly they were looking everywhere for her and eventually traced her and went to her house. And it just really messed with her head. And then they kept going to see her and they kept going to see her, and then realized, well, she was never going to go back. I mean, she had no intention of that. And they just stopped going to see her.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1970s)

And you're left high and dry. You grieve almost all over again, don't you?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=1977s)

And so did my ex-father-in-law, yeah, grieve all over again because I don't think he ever, it was only him and his sister, and I don't think he ever got over his parents leaving and his sister leaving. And he was all excited about this, you know, and then suddenly we were told.

### **Jacky Hart**

Same as my mum. She had her sisters. Three sisters all contacted. And each time the priest would come back and say, "Oh no, they don't want anything to do with us. Oh no, they shut the door in our face. No, no." I mean, talk about rubbing salt in a wound. All her hopes that everyone was going to come back, it was all going to be happy families again. It was awful. And then once they realized that actually you're quite settled and happy in the life you've made, that was it. Wash our hands again. Somebody, an ex-member of many years, once described the review to me: "It felt like they were coming to wash their hands in my sink." And I thought that was a good way to put it. 

You know, [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2057s) the description was that they weren't coming with a genuine desire. Although it was lovely, we had the same thing. We saw, my husband saw his parents again after 27 years. I saw my brother. My mother saw her son. But it all came to nothing. And there was all the apology for how you were treated, like you had, John, you know, it was wrong and so on and so forth. Um, and then the door slammed shut. And that was, it was exactly like they were absolving their consciences. "You're not coming [back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2088s), that's it." The door comes down again. And that sure messes with your head again, does, or can do.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2093s)

Yeah. I just wonder, Carman, what was it, what was the review like for you? What were you told, I assume in another country?

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2099s)

Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2100s)

Well, I was inside at the time of the review, um, but not going to meetings.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2104s)

Right.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2105s)

Oh yeah, I had the best of both worlds.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2111s)

You were causing, yeah, you were causing havoc. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2115s)

Yeah. But were they told, because we sometimes find there's a variation about how different countries within the Brethren react to the latest ministry, whatever that might be. So do you think it was different in the States? Do you have much...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2130s)

No, it was almost exactly the same wording and they did almost exactly the same things. The only thing I had the advantage of, they did it to my brothers and my mom. And at that point, there was a will that was still up in the air. So when they called me, they said, "We have taken back what we did to your brothers." And so in that moment, I was like, "Okay, so if you were wrong, there's a will still hanging out there. I would assume you're going to put that right."

### **Jacky Hart**

And did they?

### **Carman Drever**

And in that one case, they did.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2166s)

Okay. Yeah. Right time, right place. Right time, you know.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2172s)

It doesn't happen like that very often.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2173s)

It doesn't, but yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2174s)

You know, I think that's why they never put it in writing, is because they knew there would be so many cases of that. You know, where they said, "Oh, we were wrong, we take it back." You know, then you need to fix some other crap that you did too.

### [**Get A Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2190s)

Yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2191s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2192s)

Sorry, John, go on.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2195s)

So in the UK, Carman, that would be called a blue cheese bonus.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2203s)

Yeah, that's a very good one. Yeah. Remember that one. But I can remember in the review having a letter from, um, a girl that was a very good friend of mine when we were growing up, out of the blue, with photos of her children. And I was so pleased to get it. And I wrote back to her because in it she said, you know, "It'd be nice to keep in touch and ties should never have been broken," were her words. So I wrote back to her and sent pictures of my girls and everything else and, um, didn't hear a word. That was it. Nothing.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2230s)

Nothing. Yeah. So, yeah, you have to know, it was so confusing for those inside as well as those outside. You know, like I say, there was people getting hope. My dad had great hope of seeing his sister again. But actually, thankfully, she said, "I don't want anything to do with you. You know, I'm too old now and it's been too long and you washed your hands of me. No." And, you know, she was, [which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2260s) is sort of good in that she did stand up to them.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2263s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2264s)

But he, again, he did have all this hope, you know, all this excitement of, "Oh, I'm going to see Mary again." You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it was inside as well. Yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2277s)

I wonder sometimes when we meet people, um, like you said you met your brother, and they're so untaught in there. Um, you know, so lack of Bible study, so lack of knowledge about the Bible. I wonder sometimes when we meet them if they're intimidated and that's why they don't want to engage with us.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2298s)

I think you're probably right. Yeah. It's a conversation with somebody inside, for it to work, kind of has to be on their terms. Yeah. If you know what I mean. And it's not...

I remember a very interesting conversation I had with my brother around the time of the review because his daughters are a similar age to my daughters, to our daughters. Um, so they're obviously first cousins, but they've never met. And I remember I met my brother around the time of the review and I asked him whether the girls could meet because I thought it'd be nice. And his actual reply was, "Um, yes, we'll have to think about that because I'm just not too sure how far we should go." [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2347s) you could tell straight away what he was worried about was, yeah, you know, they might get on, they might actually quite enjoy each other's company. And they were in their sort of early mid-teens then. We really couldn't have that, could we? Yeah, yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2363s)

It's funny you should say that because I've experienced that even since I've left myself.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2369s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2370s)

That when I did have contact with my children, they struggled because I was just normal. I was still Mom. And they wanted to almost think of me as this evil, awful person. And the conversation started to flow and suddenly they got scared. Yeah. And I think certainly for some of my children, it was easier for them to cut me off than to see me as me still. Yeah. They'd rather cut me off [almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2401s) and believe all the lies and all that stuff, that I'm evil. Yeah, it's almost easier for them.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2406s)

And when they don't see you or have contact with you, it's easier to believe that. Yeah, absolutely. There's nothing to diffuse it.

I wanted to touch on something you said, John, that probably is quite a tough subject. You mentioned about somebody you were speaking to who, as a grandmother, said, "You know, I can't imagine that." And I know this is something that's very hurtful to Anne. So Anne, forgive me if it does upset you. I've recently become a grandmother. I know you're a grandmother, Carman. Yep, seven times over. Yeah. Oh, well, you've got streets on me. Roz, I'm assuming you're not a grandmother yet.

### **Ros Atmore**

No, not quite.

### **Jacky Hart**

But to go back in all seriousness, it is, it is a very precious thing. And legally, again, grandparents, parents do have rights. So the effect on families, it's not just fathers and sons, but it's generations. And I know, Anne, for you, it's extremely difficult because you've quite openly said you don't know how many grandchildren you've got, you haven't seen them.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2476s)

Well, I'd just like to say, interestingly, since that article went out...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2482s)

Okay.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2482s)

Um, obviously I wouldn't name any name, well, I don't even know the person's name, but somebody from the inside has sent me all the photographs...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2494s)

Oh.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2495s)

of my grandchildren. Oh, don't, now I'm going to get...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2499s)

emotional.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2499s)

Yeah. That's awesome. I've got, I've got five grandchildren.

### **\[Jacky Hart\]**

Oh, wow. And you've now got recent photos of them?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2506s)

Yeah. And of my children. And of my parents. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2512s)

And I don't think the powers that control the Brethren inside realize how precious, how much it means to you just to have a photo. Um, it's a lifeline and it raises your hope. And I think to try and get across to people that have never been in the Brethren that this happens, and it happens right here in what is supposed to be a civilized Western country, not just the UK, but the States and New Zealand and Australia and Canada.

And you've got this level of heart and harm, harm and hurt continuing. Yeah.

Yeah, I, like everybody, I just hope it will change one day.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2560s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2564s)

Sorry, John. Sorry.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2582s)

You mentioned "the powers," Jacky, yeah. Maybe a slip of your tongue, because the amazing thing is, there's no powers in there. There's only one power.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2592s)

No.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2592s)

And a lot of people I've spoken to over the decades can't get their head around this, that there's only one person who controls everything literally. And everybody, literally. There are sort of facilitators or leaders in the localities, but they all submit to one person.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2611s)

Yes, I agree with you. I was choosing my words euphemistically, cautiously, but I totally agree with you. There is one power.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2619s)

Yeah. But you know, the control and the separation of husbands and wives and grandparents and grandchildren and brothers and sisters, it's only happening because of one man. And if he, if he was to change the rules, if he was to pretend, like he does, that God has turned another corner, um, if he was to realize that he can make a lot more money if he opens the doors a bit wider and changes his policies, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2649s) know, that's a possibility. Because I know making a lot of money is what they're very interested in. And I would suggest, if you're listening, that you can make a lot more money, you know, if you ditch a lot of your religious stuff which isn't really of any value, let's face it. You know, we can...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2666s)

We can even come up with a scripture to back it. You know, there's a scripture out there that says, "What God puts together, let no man tear apart." So we can even find in the Bible a directive for him to fall back on if he needs a scripture. Because I kind of doubt he's reading them all, but that one seems to have slipped out of his Bible. But if he put it back in there, there's actually a scriptural basis to do just what you asked him to do.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2696s)

Absolutely. And one of the things that holds probably only a small fraction of the Brethren is what they call the doctrinal matters, because I reckon that most of them, as I, when I was in, don't really, didn't really understand the doctrines and what the Bible says and you could say the theology behind it. Because I'm here to tell you that, well, if you're in the Brethren and you're watching this, that your interpretation of the Bible is absolutely so way off the [mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2726s) that instead of bringing unity, love, and joy, and peace, it's bringing fear, destruction, and a torment to thousands upon thousands of people. You know, I think the Bible says that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. Well, that's what your group has been doing for many, many decades.

 And there's something which amazed me when I first heard about it, which if you're Brethren and watching this, you may [never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2757s) have heard this before. I'll just start all quickly by saying that I once came out of a meeting at Alison Road in Liverpool. I was about 12 and for some reason I had this funny thought. I thought, "There's only the Catholics, the Protestants, the Baptists, the Methodists and us." And so those four are clearly wrong, you know, because we've got the Man of God and we've got the right interpretation of the Bible. 

You know something listed on the internet? Here's a fact. Go and check it out yourself, because most of you got the internet now. There's over 40,000 religious denominations in the world. 40,000. And every single one of them, they all have one thing in common like you: they all believe they are the right one. Yeah. And I once said to these Jehovah's Witnesses on the street, when I told them this, I was standing next to a bookmaker's and I said, "See the bookies over there? I could go in there now and the odds of you being the right religion is 40,000 to one." Yeah. You know, and they haven't realized that. No. [It's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2817s) an absolute fallacy and a farce to think that they could be the right one when there's thousands upon thousands of interpretations of the Bible, anyway. No.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2825s)

It's absolutely true. And, um, if you think about it logically, wasn't it in, I think, um, in the Sydney seminar, they said something about the Brethren being 0.000, I can't remember the actual, but a very, very small percentage of the world population. "And we are chosen." Well, if God wasn't an all-loving, you know, encompassing God, why has he selected 0.000000000 percent of the population to be the chosen ones? Um, it logically, it doesn't make any sense, does it? No, it just doesn't. 

You know, to any Brethren listening, just [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2864s) about it logically. If the God you believe in is the God that loves everybody and forgives everybody and accepts people just the way they are, how is it there's this minute little bit of the population that incidentally is causing so much havoc in people's lives, why would he just choose those to be the special ones? Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2883s)

I remember, I remember my sister saying to me when I left, she said, she said, "Do you honestly think that 55,000 people are wrong and you're right?" I said, "Hang on, there's a few more than 55,000 in this world." Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2900s)

Do you honestly think 55,000 people are right and however many million are wrong? Yeah. It was only me that was wrong though.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2908s)

That's their world.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2910s)

That's their world, isn't it? Yeah. It is literally their world. You're right.

Yeah, you're right. I think it's because the insular environment, the community they live in, they don't, they don't allow themselves, or they aren't allowed, I don't know which it is, to see beyond that. So you're right.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2930s)

Yeah. Well, certainly, when I left, it was, I didn't, I could never see the big picture.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2939s)

No.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2940s)

You know, it took me, it took me quite a while to see the big picture, but there's so much more out here than just them. Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2948s)

Yeah, yeah. And I think the other thing that is quite difficult to help people who've never been in a controlling group to understand is when they see a controlling group behaving in a way that's frankly out of order, like splitting up families and just saying to John's parents, you know, "You can't speak to your son," they don't realize, it's hard to explain that in that person in the Brethren's [mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=2979s), they're doing the right thing. Yeah. And I think that's very hard to explain to somebody that hasn't had their mind controlled by a very interested group. Um, when they take children off their parents in the manner they sometimes do, most people would say that's horrendous, but they really believe they're doing the right thing. And to do anything to achieve those ends is right. And that's a very hard thing to explain, isn't it?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3009s)

Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3010s)

Yeah. But in saying that, I mean, they might think they're doing the right thing, but the man at the top knows what he's doing.

### **Jacky Hart**

Oh, I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3027s)

I don't think...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3028s)

…he's brainwashed.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3030s)

No.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3031s)

No. I think, and Jacky, you often bring this up, that whole Faith in Practice document is so exposing of this because that's a document that the Bruce Hales administration wrote and filed and put it out there saying, "These are the things that we agreed to follow." In there, they say, you know, there's no reason that an ex-Brethren member can't go to a funeral. And yet when it comes to practice, they don't even let us [know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3061s) when somebody passes away. So they've gone to such lengths to put a pretty picture or a pretty cover on what they are. And yet underneath, most of the people in there wouldn't even know that document...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3073s)

exists. They don't know that document exists for sure. They don't know. And if they do know, they certainly don't understand the nuances of it. Um, and we were actually told by somebody inside the Brethren, formally told, that that document didn't mean the Brethren had to make any changes. That document is just how the Brethren see their faith. That is how they behave.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3097s)

And apparently, we were told just recently that when that document was filed, there were a certain amount of copies distributed, and at one point real recently, all those copies were instructed to be returned. Yeah. And because he doesn't want those copies circulating anywhere in case people start to figure out that this is the picture that they painted, this is what they told the government they were going to do.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3124s)

Yeah. So perhaps to briefly explain to anybody that doesn't know, in the UK here, the Brethren's charitable status was challenged because the Charity Commission felt not only were they not there for public benefit, but they also caused harm. And in law, if a charity's harm outweighs their benefit, they can't be charitable. That's the bottom line. The public benefit issue they addressed by introducing the lovely Rapid Relief Team, and the harm they addressed by [agreeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3154s) this document that was written by Brethren lawyers and by Charity Commission lawyers. And it was agreed literally about two days before the whole case was going to go to the High Court. And in the High Court, a lot of evidence from ex-Brethren would have been aired in a public High Court, but that was all avoided.

The Charity Commission told us that they would expect and help the Brethren to change rather than take away their charitable status.

One of the concerns expressed to the Charity Commission at the time was that most of the Brethren would never be told about this document that's been incorporated in the trustees of every trust. And the Charity Commission assured us that the Brethren told them all the Brethren had been told. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3204s)

Well, when all the copies were retracted and hauled back to Sydney, you know how they were told. They were told briefly and then they were retracted.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3213s)

Yeah. So obviously...

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3215s)

So indicative of a dictatorship.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3218s)

Though, absolutely. "Tell them what they need to know." I mean, Anne and Roz, you would have still been in when that document was incorporated because it was through the year of 2014\. Have you got a memory?

### **Anne Hamilton**

I left just before.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3233s)

Just before. Roz, do you remember?

### **Ros Atmore**

Yeah, yeah. We had to document all sorts of things. Like, we were told any good deed we did, we had to document. So if we took the neighbor's bins out, we'd document it. I do remember that bit, actually. We were laughing.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3254s)

But we had like this little thing, each subdivision had a person that was appointed to collecting the good deeds that you were supposed to do and you were supposed to write them down. And it was ridiculous.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3269s)

It was before, yeah, it was before they got the RRT up and running, really, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember, I remember my second son Scott going and clearing the snow from the doctor's surgery path and that was documented. Yeah, yeah. So that was happening before, that was happening while the whole charity thing was going on before I left.

### **Jacky Hart**

It went on for a few years, I think, didn't it?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3293s)

Yeah, yeah. I think it started in 2012 because that's when I listened to some of these ex-Brethren, um, talking and what they were saying, I realized what they were saying was true. And I was like, "Hang on a minute, it is true what they're saying." And yet we were told, "Oh, they're just telling lies," you know. And that sort of woke me up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3316s)

When they had to document all the good deeds, were they allowed to, um, mention if they cleared up any dog or cat crap off the pavement? Because I'm coming onto the show with the pets, because I'm just distracted by this beautiful, beautiful animal. And of course, it reminds me of the time when pets were banned. Yeah. It was actually just when I was born, but pets were banned. And I collected, when [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3346s) was writing the book, quite a few stories of pets that were destroyed. Yes.

 Um, and when I was mentioning the book on LinkedIn amongst the business community, a lot of them were very, very horrified people to hear that pets were treated that way, you know. Um, and it's a horrible thing. I realized one day that, and I don't know if I've never thought of this, that the same creator of me and you, the same creator of these animals. Yeah. So let those, let those pets alone. Stop, stop, um, shunning them. Nothing, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3382s)

Yeah, yeah. I mean, my husband had a cat as a child and came home from school one day and the cat wasn't there. Yeah. It's that because of this, um, ministry. And you're right. Um, there's been rumors that, um, some people are having animals now, um, but not as pets, if they need them for farming. Is that, is that correct?

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3408s)

Yeah, yeah. I actually, I actually asked somebody inside, yeah, after, you know, what they said at the end of that article in *The Sun*.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3416s)

Yes.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3417s)

They said about pets and they said about television and they said about makeup and trousers on women and television and all the rest. Anyway, I asked this person and, um, she came back and said pets are allowed if, yeah, a cat might be allowed on a farm.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3436s)

Right.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3437s)

Or if somebody works in something rural, um, some people have, well they would have had when I was in, rabbits or something like that, if they were breeding them. Yeah. Or chickens, if you've got eggs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no, she said there's no animals in the house.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3456s)

Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3459s)

And certainly as far as what they said about trousers and television and contraception was the other thing that they said that they do now. She said that, you know, all that's rubbish. She said, yes, there's people that are secretly taking contraception probably and they just talk amongst themselves. And there probably is young people listening to music, but if they were found out, they would be in trouble. [And](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3490s) certainly not women wearing trousers as such. I mean, they wear these leggings and the skirt on top. Yeah. And yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3497s)

They wear leggings and and quite short skirts now and like long coats or cardigans, so it makes it look like they've got just leggings on.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3506s)

Ah, right. Yeah. Yeah, very...

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3509s)

borderline behavior, in my opinion, but...

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3511s)

You know what, I could accept all that, yeah, but just stop splitting up families. Yeah. Stop ruining families. Yeah. I can accept all that.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3526s)

Yeah, I was going to say the other side of the coin, Anne, to everybody, I grew up without grandparents because they'd left in 1970\. And when I left at the age of 40, I met my grandma for the first time. And what an absolutely gorgeous lady. I mean, how evil is that [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3556s) have kept me locked away from her? I was never held by my grandma. I was never, you know. And she loves me. She's accepted me into her life these last three years. She was 98 when I met her, and she's 102\. She still comes to the door to wave us off. I mean, if that's not a gift from God for these last four years, I count every [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3587s) minute I spend in her company because she's so, so special. Um, how dare they block these poor, these babies, these children, they don't have a choice whether they get to see their grandma. Now, I never had that choice.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3605s)

I mean, what were you told as a child? I'm just sort of wondering what my grandchildren are told. What were you told? Interesting question.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3613s)

I was told that they were against Mr. Jim, so they didn't believe that Mr. Jim was a pure man, so therefore we could have absolutely no longer any contact with them because they were condemned to the devil.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3633s)

Right.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3634s)

They were evil, evil people. I mean, she is so, so purely still Brethren in one sense. She wears her dresses and she has her hair and she's never had a television and she's just exactly the same loving lady and grandma that she always was, um, to my mom. And she's been denied all of us, you know. And when my sisters left, they all [ran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3672s) to her and she welcomed them into her life as a grandma again. No reproach, no nothing.

### **Anne Hamilton**

No, absolutely not. That says it all.

### **Jacky Hart**

And I was known as, I don't know whether any of you knew, but I was always known as Wizzy. And so all my family knew me as Wizzy. And so when I see my grandma, she asks now, "Who are you, dear?" So I have to tell [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3702s), "Wizzy," and she knows, she can place me then. Oh yeah. And she knows who I am. I mean, it's just so, so darling. I think that's an interesting thing, isn't it? Because we know, I mean, I'm not, parents get split from their children, but there is that generational thing. And it's every bit as heartbreaking and destructive. Um, grandparents are important people in little people's lives, aren't they? And [to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3732s) not have them is what we'll all fight for.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3735s)

Yeah. Your story gives me hope, Roz. You know, because I know I often say, you know, it may not be my children, but it could be my grandchildren. It could be your grandchildren. I hope, I hope it's before I'm 98 or whatever, 97\. I'd still have my arms open for them. Yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3756s)

Yeah. Hopefully, we will have caused a revolt by then. So, well, that's the hope. Open some eyes. Wake up and smell the coffee. Yeah, yeah. So, John, you've written your book and you've obviously put a lot of thought into this. How would you, I want to say, how would you like to see it being resolved? I mean, it's a very complex situation, isn't it? Because there's many people in the Brethren, particularly older people, who you [wouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3786s) want things to change for them because it would devastate them. But how would you see that we could resolve this ongoing hurt and harm that's caused?

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3796s)

Well, I've come to believe that people have got a free will, and the only thing in this world that works is love. And that's the God that I was brought up to believe, you know, was a monster god, a monster that destroyed families and split up husbands and wives and children. You know, that was the monster God that I was brought up to believe in, whereas now I believe God is the God of unconditional love and he accepts us just as we are, no matter [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3826s) mess. And I can cope with that. Yeah, we all can. We all want loving, we all need to be loved. 

And so, to try and alter people's minds and change their minds and to, um, change their, what their will is, I believe is control. It can't be done. People have a choice and people can stay in their cult if they want to. That is their choice. But, um, what one thing that can be done, I think, is just create awareness. And that's [what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3856s) these videos are doing and these podcasts are doing. And it's great with the internet and YouTube and all the platforms that there's so much exposure now to these cults. You know, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, so many of them. 

There's almost a thousand cults in the UK, literally. I went to see the list in a charity in London just before COVID. And so that's one thing that can be continued to be done, is creating awareness. And then people, if they want to turn their heads and have a look, if they realize [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3886s) um, it's not love what's happening. You know, I would say from my experience in the Brethren, they are void of love. There's no love there. It is just law-based. And the laws are just the laws from one man. It's not biblical law, even. It is laws from one man. And so if that's what people want, you know, have it. But, um, so creating awareness is about the only thing I can see personally. And then people can make a [choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3916s). Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3917s)

I agree. And I think the podcast that, um, Cheryl and Carman and Richard and Lane started and we'd like to all continue, it's not only creating awareness, it's also documenting stories.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3933s)

And I think every person that's left the Brethren, every person that's had to fight their way out of a controlling group has a story of pain to tell. And it's not that you dwell on that pain, but documenting the stories, otherwise nobody knows this is going on, nobody knows what angst people go through. So I think it's a valuable tool for doing that as well as raising awareness. So we'll keep doing it.

### **John Spinks**

Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3963s)

Yeah. Well, John, thank you very much for coming on. And, um, I have read your book and I did enjoy it. Yeah. And I'm looking forward to yours too, Anne. Um, thank you everybody for the first podcast from the UK. And, um, hope to see you all soon. And again, um, if anybody wants to share their story or doesn't want to fight with Canada time zones and is in the UK, if you email the... what is it, Carman?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3994s)

Uh, info.getalife@proton.me.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=3999s)

I should probably have rehearsed that before I came on, shouldn't I?

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4001s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4002s)

Yeah, I'd have been as slick as Cheryl then, wouldn't I? Yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4005s)

Leave it in the comments. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4008s)

Please email and we'll try to keep the awareness and these podcasts going.

### [**Anne Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4013s)

Yeah, absolutely.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4014s)

Yeah.

### [**John Spinks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4016s)

Yeah.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4016s)

Thank you, John. Lovely to see you. Thanks everybody.

### [**Carman Drever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4020s)

Yes, thank you.

### [**Jacky Hart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ztUHbX8e0&t=4021s)
